26330	162880	00:26	Second year PhD student in philosophy at the University of Sussex. Talks about the active inference agent and trying to cover some of the basics. Aim is to see how active inference applies to larger scales, collective behavior, social norms, sociocultural landscapes.	This module looks at how active inference has connected with philosophical interests	The Active Inference Agent
163570	260960	02:43	Active inference is based on Karl Friston's free energy principle. All adaptive behavior is explained by agents garnering evidence to confirm their own expectations. For the purposes of the lecture today, I'm going to treat these as synonymous with predictive processing.	Active inference is based on Karl Friston's free energy principle	Inactive Inference and Predictive Processing
262630	681030	04:22	The framework says that agents embody or agents have a generative model. Using that model, the agent can generate predictions about its own sensory states. But where those predictions don't actually match the sensory inputs, prediction errors are generated. These errors can be minimized using one of two strategies.	Ramstead: Predictive processing involves minimizing prediction errors through active inference	Inference, Predictive Processing
681610	875184	11:21	The idea of affordances first emerges in the work of James Gibson. They are things, roughly speaking, in the environment that the agent can act upon. Different surfaces and features of the environment will afford different things depending on your particular skill set. And agents are going to go about minimizing their uncertainty, staying attuned to their environment through an engagement with affordances.	Attunement is one of those concepts that gets thrown around a lot	Attunement and the science of inference
875232	1349070	14:35	Sensory motor in activism emphasizes how mobile and embodied agents essentially enact the grounds and conditions for their own sensory engagements with the world. Are we committing ourselves to a form of cognitivism? What role, if any, there are for representations in active inference?	Sensory motor in activism emphasizes how mobile and embodied agents enact conditions	What are we Committing ourselves to with Active Inaction?
1350640	1589720	22:30	Under some conditions the system that's realizing cognitive processing can literally extend outwards from the mind. Andy Clark thinks that active inference accommodates the extended mind theory. Active inference agents are porous. They're open to recruiting external material features of the environment. There's a lot to get through here.	Andy Clark says active inference accommodates extended mind theory	Extended Inference and Inactivism
1590890	1702060	26:30	There's a challenge here about how active inference can account for what appear to be motivated agential actions. And I'm going to set active inference up in a kind of dialectic with folk psychology here, because folk psychology faces no such concerns.	There is a canonical philosophical worry in active inference about minimizing prediction error	Inactive Inference and Folk Psychology
1704030	2497478	28:24	The dark room problem invites more than one answer. Colin Klein argues that predictions alone can't account for the motivational character of these needs. How does active inference actually account for agential behavior?	Ryan Dewhurst: The dark room problem invites more than one answer	Dark Room and the motivational character of human behavior
2497574	2587240	41:37	We have an actual account of agency under active inference. And then we have this worry about the relationship with folk psychology. But it turns out that active inference agents are in fact agents with beliefs, desires and hopes and dreams.	We worry about the relationship between active inference and folk psychology	Wonders of Active Inference and Folk Psychology
2591290	2657630	43:11	At the end, I'm going to talk about allostatis and emotion. Here's some examples of some of the core readings I've used. These are all going to be up in the document as well, which will be made available.	In this section I'm going to introduce quite a lot of stuff	Case Studies 6, Allostatis and emotion
2657700	2908480	44:17	The notion of allostatis plays a major role in a lot of work on emotion and the self. Our highest expectation is to have good allostatic control. Not having good control has been linked with many health problems.	Brain evolved to minimize prediction error to manage body's metabolic budget	Priority 6, Allostatic control and arousal
2911250	3252620	48:31	Allostatis control means inferring the causes of changes to the body's internal state. In order to know what to do, the brain needs to contextualize those changes. Emotions are essentially doing the same thing. It's absolutely vital to understanding how we maintain this core embodied feeling.	Lisa Feldman Barrett's Theory of Constructed Emotion is incredibly important	The Theory of Constructed Emotion
3255870	3728410	54:15	Allostatic control for humans can involve very temporarily extended scales. One has to model oneself as a potential cause of sensory inputs. To do this, the system must engage in interceptive prediction over its own internal states. This has formed the basis for a lot of interesting work on phenomena like depersonalization.	Allostatic control models model the self under active inference	A sense of self under active inference
3729340	3844004	1:02:09	This is the final section. I want to try and pull together some of the things I've been talking about. The case study I'm going to use is addiction. In the discussion section on the 25th, when we have an hour to kind of unpack and answer people's questions, we're actually going to be joined by Mark Miller.	This is the final section and it's probably going to be longest	Predictive Processes in Neuroscience, Section 4
3844122	4568110	1:04:04	The main difference between a full blooded emotion state and an existential feeling is that the emotion state is about something. The idea here is that systems are sensitive to the success or failure of their own action policies unfolding across multiple timescales. What this work is doing is building a bridge between computational models and neurobiology and phenomenological experience.

4569680	4986590	1:16:09	Aerodynamics has been applied in a bunch of different areas. But I chose addiction because it brings out not just the way that all of this fits together, but also why it's good. We can view addiction as a self organizing process of whole agent environment systems.	So addiction was once viewed as a moral failing. There was something wrong with the addict	Addiction and the brain
4986740	5531260	1:23:06	The addict is addiction becomes an identity. It becomes a world that the person actually produces through their actions. Active inference agents are embodied. They're embedded in a landscape. And it also speaks to the role played by embodied affect in phenomenology.	This is an enactive account of addiction rather than a disease model	Inclination and addiction
