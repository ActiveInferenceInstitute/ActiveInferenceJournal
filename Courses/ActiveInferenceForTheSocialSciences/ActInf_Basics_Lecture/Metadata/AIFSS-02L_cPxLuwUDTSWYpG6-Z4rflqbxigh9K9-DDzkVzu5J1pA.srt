00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,830
Hello. All right. Hello and welcome,

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,946
everyone. It is July 11,

3
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:09,482
2023. We are in active inference

4
00:00:09,546 --> 00:00:12,126
for the social sciences, and today is

5
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:14,766
going to be a lecture by Ben White on

6
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:16,906
basics of active inference, the active

7
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:19,134
inference agent. So, Ben, thank you for

8
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:22,186
the lecture. Off to you, and we're

9
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:24,446
looking forward to it. Thank you very

10
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:27,958
much. Yeah, me too. Very happy to be

11
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:30,374
a part of this, to be kicking things off

12
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:33,320
with the first module on this course.

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,386
I'm going to be talking about the active

14
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:38,358
inference agent and trying to cover some

15
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:41,046
of the basics. I won't take too long

16
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:42,874
introducing myself. Ava gave a very

17
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:45,946
thorough introduction in his talk

18
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:48,934
recently, but I'm a second year PhD

19
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,566
student in philosophy at the University

20
00:00:50,598 --> 00:00:52,522
of Sussex, and I work with Andy Clark

21
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,654
and with Avel and some other people

22
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:57,934
using active inference to try and find

23
00:00:57,972 --> 00:01:00,270
things out about our relationship with

24
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,494
technology and within the context of

25
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:06,334
well being and mental health. The aims

26
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:09,060
for today I'm going to try and provide

27
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,202
quite a wide ranging overview of how

28
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:15,330
active inference has connected with

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,880
areas of philosophical interest, and

30
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,166
particularly how they relate to the

31
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:22,438
individual agent and the experience of

32
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:24,306
the agent and how the agent finds

33
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:26,146
themselves in the world. So I've split

34
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:29,010
this up to look at several different

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,754
defined topics. So I'm going to move

36
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,502
quite quickly through mind, agency,

37
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:37,226
emotion, and phenomenology, and I'm

38
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:38,858
going to say a little bit about the self

39
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:40,746
as well. And then there's going to be a

40
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,538
case study at the end that I'm going to

41
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:45,518
move through if we have time. So one of

42
00:01:45,524 --> 00:01:48,014
the other aims that I have is to lay out

43
00:01:48,052 --> 00:01:49,946
very clearly some of the core concepts

44
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:51,866
and core mechanisms like precision,

45
00:01:51,898 --> 00:01:54,314
weighting, and prediction error enactive

46
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:57,330
models. I'm not going to go into any

47
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,346
technical details whatsoever. This is

48
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:01,490
all going to be fairly abstract. My

49
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,154
background and my interest in these

50
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:05,086
frameworks is philosophical, so it's

51
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:07,606
quite abstract in terms of how

52
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,038
everything fits together. And I'm going

53
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:11,826
to try and bring some of these threads

54
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:15,430
together to build up a layered picture

55
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,106
of what the active inference agent is

56
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:21,114
like, because this course is kind of

57
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:22,726
aimed towards seeing how active

58
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:26,262
inference applies to larger scales,

59
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:28,614
collective behavior, social norms,

60
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:31,306
sociocultural landscapes. And I think in

61
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:33,726
order to do justice to those things, we

62
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:35,966
need to first have a good idea of the

63
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:39,306
individual in active inference. So we've

64
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:42,254
got our work cut out for us. So I'll get

65
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:45,466
started. So before I dive

66
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,866
in, I wanted to just say a little bit

67
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:48,286
about how these frameworks hang

68
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,874
together. So active inference is

69
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:53,442
based on Karl Friston's free energy

70
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:54,946
principle. I think most of us are

71
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:57,602
familiar with that. But the free energy

72
00:02:57,656 --> 00:02:59,126
principle just states that in order to

73
00:02:59,148 --> 00:03:01,074
persist through time, biological

74
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:03,382
organisms must occupy only those states

75
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:05,254
that it would expect to occupy, given

76
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:07,574
the type of thing that it is so free

77
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:09,510
energy is essentially a measure of the

78
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,514
disatunment between a system and its

79
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:13,818
environment. And I'm going to say a

80
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:15,626
little bit more about attunement and how

81
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:17,866
that gets cashed out in various ways as

82
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,670
we go on. Active inference is a process

83
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,718
theory that essentially explains how

84
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:24,862
embodied organisms actually go about

85
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,726
remaining in those expected states. So

86
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,494
how we actually go about minimizing free

87
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:33,074
energy. And the idea is that all

88
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:36,050
adaptive behavior is explained by agents

89
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,218
garnering evidence to confirm their own

90
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:42,654
expectations. Predictive processing.

91
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:44,498
For the purposes of the lecture today,

92
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:46,222
I'm going to treat these as synonymous

93
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:49,222
because most of the work that I kind of

94
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:51,574
came up through as I was learning about

95
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:54,294
this was predictive processing. And all

96
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:56,838
of the papers that we're using today

97
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:59,478
that refer to predictive processing

98
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:02,026
refer to a predictive processing that I

99
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:04,186
take to be more or less synonymous with

100
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,570
active inference. So that's a very

101
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,766
embodied, inactive flavor of predictive

102
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:11,626
processing. I think generally the

103
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,194
difference is that predictive processing

104
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:14,606
can be a much broader term and

105
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:16,702
predictive processing can also apply to

106
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:18,906
passive models of perception. But we're

107
00:04:18,938 --> 00:04:20,366
not going to concern ourselves with

108
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:23,380
that. Okay,

109
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,678
so some key concepts of active

110
00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:28,100
inference, predictive processing then.

111
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,206
So the framework says that agents embody

112
00:04:32,318 --> 00:04:35,326
or agents have we won't concern

113
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,894
ourselves with the nuance there, but

114
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:39,734
they have a generative model, which is

115
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:43,074
essentially a kind of understanding

116
00:04:43,122 --> 00:04:45,494
or a model of the regularities that

117
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:47,510
underpin the dynamics between the agent

118
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,638
and the environment. So another way to

119
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:51,354
think about this in very rough terms is

120
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:53,674
a kind of mental model of the

121
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:55,946
regularities in the world and how the

122
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:58,650
agent exists in the world. And using

123
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,658
that model, the agent can generate

124
00:05:00,694 --> 00:05:02,634
predictions about its own sensory

125
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:05,418
states. So given the model, what kinds

126
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:07,326
of sensory states would it expect to

127
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,406
find itself in in a particular set of

128
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:12,622
circumstances? And so where those

129
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:15,186
predictions don't actually match the

130
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,946
sensory inputs. So where there's a

131
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,894
discrepancy between the actual incoming

132
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:21,330
sense data and the prediction,

133
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,634
prediction errors are generated and

134
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,006
prediction errors are going to flow

135
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,526
upwards through the hierarchy. So the

136
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:29,014
generative model is said to be a

137
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:30,914
hierarchical model and predictions flow

138
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,786
downwards and prediction errors flow

139
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:36,182
upwards. And the sole imperative of the

140
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,026
brain body system, according to this

141
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:39,706
framework is to minimize those

142
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:41,050
prediction errors.

143
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,538
So a good way to kind of get a

144
00:05:46,544 --> 00:05:48,250
little handle on this is to think about

145
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,426
just the example of perception. So

146
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:52,346
perception traditionally so I'm talking

147
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:53,738
about visual perception here. It's

148
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,006
traditionally been understood as a

149
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:57,502
bottom up process. And what that means

150
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:59,834
is that the brain waits for incoming

151
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:01,914
sensory signals and then it processes

152
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,074
them as they come in and it combines

153
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:05,774
them in kind of increasingly abstract

154
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:08,242
ways. And what we see is some

155
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:10,174
combination of those sensory signals

156
00:06:10,222 --> 00:06:11,986
that have come in and been processed and

157
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:15,234
combined. So if you think about me

158
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:17,606
leaving my apartment in the morning and

159
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,302
stepping out onto the street and seeing

160
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:21,494
some cars. What's happening there is

161
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:23,366
some sensory information is hitting my

162
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:25,990
retina and it's being processed first

163
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,678
with very basic features like light

164
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:31,046
shade, edges and so on and so forth.

165
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,258
And then it's being combined with my

166
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:35,418
understanding of what a car is or what a

167
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:37,898
bus stop is. And that gives me my kind

168
00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:39,020
of visual field.

169
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,726
Predictive processing, famously at this

170
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:45,886
point, flips this picture upside down on

171
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:47,934
its head. So visual perception under

172
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:49,918
predictive processing is a top down

173
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:52,798
affair. So the Generative model is going

174
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:55,634
to encode multilevel expectations about

175
00:06:55,672 --> 00:06:57,346
the likely scene. So, just to be very

176
00:06:57,368 --> 00:06:59,666
clear, when we talk about multilevel and

177
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:03,298
hierarchical, the higher up levels are

178
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:05,006
going to be tracking longer timescales

179
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:07,106
and higher levels of abstraction, and

180
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:08,434
the lower levels are going to be much

181
00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:12,566
faster and much more concrete. So a

182
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:14,566
changeable scene, so there's going to be

183
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:16,438
some variation in what I see when I

184
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:18,438
leave my apartment every day is going to

185
00:07:18,444 --> 00:07:19,446
mean that there's always going to be

186
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:20,978
some error in that picture. So it's

187
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:22,858
never going to be the same two days in a

188
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:25,546
row or it's extremely unlikely to be.

189
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:27,866
So no matter how well I can predict what

190
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:29,418
I'm going to see when I leave my house,

191
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:31,374
it's always going to be cleaned up by

192
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:33,914
some prediction errors. So essentially,

193
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:36,046
when I step outside and I step into the

194
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:39,082
street, my brain is already anticipating

195
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:42,126
what it's going to see out there. So I

196
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:43,538
know where particular cars are going to

197
00:07:43,544 --> 00:07:45,906
be parked, I know where the bus stop is,

198
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,462
so on and so forth. And the perceptual

199
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:50,466
experience that we have is a

200
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:53,554
construction. We actually experience the

201
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:55,874
expectation that has been kind of

202
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:58,050
cleaned up post prediction error.

203
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,574
There's a little bit of debate there

204
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,574
about exactly what it is that we

205
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:04,630
experience. But for our purposes today,

206
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,486
we can say that visual perception is

207
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:08,650
essentially a construction.

208
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,174
So on the face of it, prediction errors

209
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:14,794
can be minimized using one of two

210
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:16,282
strategies, and this is going to be

211
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:17,420
really important.

212
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,958
So we have what I just described there,

213
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,818
which is perceptual inference. That's

214
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:26,046
where we revise our predictions to

215
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:27,674
better fit the evidence. So essentially

216
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:29,754
we update our model to better reflect

217
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:32,750
the regularities in the environment. Or

218
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,634
we can engage in active inference,

219
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,466
which is where the framework gets its

220
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:38,318
name from, which is where we essentially

221
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:41,650
make the evidence fit the model. So

222
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,874
that's where we in some sense update the

223
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:46,218
world so it conforms to the original

224
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:49,142
prediction. And active inference agents

225
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:51,414
bring about those expected states by

226
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:53,846
sampling the world in a bias way, so

227
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:56,246
they have certain expectations and then

228
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,058
we sample the world to confirm the

229
00:08:58,064 --> 00:09:00,406
predictions. And I put perceptual

230
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:02,940
inference there in scare quotes because

231
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,614
perceptual inference on kind of readings

232
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:08,742
of most readings of active inference

233
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:10,758
just becomes a kind of action readiness.

234
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:13,038
Or as Ramstead and colleagues put it, a

235
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:15,406
state estimation. So it's just

236
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:17,306
perception and action are just wrapped

237
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:19,466
up in this continuous loop. But it's

238
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:21,406
really all about the action. It's really

239
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,086
all about bringing about those expected

240
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:25,394
states, and perception is just kind of

241
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,194
in service of that process. And so

242
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:30,178
Bruineberg and colleagues refer to the

243
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:32,974
enactive inference agent as a crooked

244
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:35,986
scientist, which is something I really

245
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,282
like. I think that's a very charming

246
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:39,734
image. So we are scientists that are

247
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:41,842
engaging in some very dodgy behavior

248
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:45,446
because we're not really interested in

249
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:46,934
having an accurate model. We're more

250
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:49,926
interested in confirming our original

251
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,474
predictions. Okay, so that

252
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,746
was a very rapid overview of some of the

253
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:59,482
core concepts and mechanisms, but

254
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:01,462
they're going to crop up continuously.

255
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:03,354
So I think we're going to get a much

256
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:06,186
better grasp on them as we go on. In

257
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,374
this section, I'm going to start to

258
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:09,006
expand on some of those things that

259
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:10,378
we've just put on the table, and I'm

260
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:11,966
going to begin to flesh them out in

261
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:14,366
terms of thinking about how active

262
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,866
inference agents actually exist in the

263
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:20,146
world. So I should say I

264
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:22,386
put this here to remind me. So those of

265
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:24,340
you who are taking part in the course,

266
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,974
I'm going to make available a document

267
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:29,326
with all of the readings that I firstly,

268
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:30,646
all of the readings that I've used to

269
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:32,726
make these slides, and then a bunch of

270
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,166
other readings as well that I think are

271
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:36,054
going to be very relevant. And

272
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:37,714
obviously, they're going to be organized

273
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,286
in terms of the structure of this

274
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:41,158
presentation as well. So this is just

275
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:42,794
I've put a little sample up on these

276
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:44,234
slides, but there's going to be much

277
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:47,686
more in the document. So I think it's

278
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:49,126
always good to start with some guiding

279
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:52,240
questions. So I've thrown up three here.

280
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,506
The first is how does enactive inference

281
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:58,286
characterize cognition? So we've just

282
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,938
looked at predictions and prediction

283
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:02,286
errors, but we're going to expand on

284
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:03,678
that a little bit. And we're going to

285
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:05,342
ask what kinds of processes does

286
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:07,902
cognition involve? How is cognition

287
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:09,550
related to the material environment?

288
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,746
This is going to be something how

289
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:13,266
cognition relates to the environment is

290
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:14,766
going to be very important in subsequent

291
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:16,934
weeks. And we're going to ask quite

292
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:18,982
briefly what kinds of vehicles might

293
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:21,030
realize cognitive processing.

294
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,482
So here's a couple of whales.

295
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:26,642
Whales are going to be a recurring theme

296
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:29,318
in this lecture, but I wanted to take a

297
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:31,750
step back and ask about Attunement

298
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,414
because this is one of those concepts

299
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:35,626
that gets thrown around a lot, and I

300
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:38,220
think once it's grasped, it becomes very

301
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,874
clear and very easy to use. But I think

302
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:42,538
prior to it being grasped, it can be a

303
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:44,842
little bit opaque and a bit slippery.

304
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:47,674
So on the left we have a humpback whale

305
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:49,386
that was found dead in the Amazon

306
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,726
rainforest, allegedly. I don't know if

307
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:53,806
this was true. And on the right we have

308
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:56,206
a whale in its natural environment. And

309
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:58,258
I think clearly the intuition here is

310
00:11:58,264 --> 00:11:59,826
that in one case the whale is very well

311
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:01,618
attuned to its environment and in the

312
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:04,226
other case it's not. And I think that we

313
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:06,626
can start by asking what is it about the

314
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:09,414
ocean that allows the whale to be well

315
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:11,734
attuned? And what I want to say here is

316
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,806
that the particular dynamics between the

317
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:17,094
ocean and the whale allow the whale to

318
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:19,706
do certain things that it can't do when

319
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:22,682
it's in the Amazon. So in other words,

320
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:25,062
we might say that the ocean affords

321
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:26,534
certain things to the whale,

322
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,942
specifically filter feeding, being able

323
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,302
to move its vast weight around with

324
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:34,958
ease, things that, unfortunately, a

325
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,262
whale in the Amazon can't do. So

326
00:12:37,316 --> 00:12:39,166
affordances are opportunities for

327
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:42,094
action. They are things,

328
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:43,894
roughly speaking, in the environment

329
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:46,526
that the agent can act upon. And there's

330
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,786
some debate about the proper way to

331
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:50,866
really characterize affordances, but I

332
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:52,350
like to think of them as relational

333
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,894
properties emerging from an

334
00:12:54,952 --> 00:12:57,922
environmental feature and some skilled

335
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,046
embodied ability of the agent. So the

336
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:03,286
same thing in the environment will not

337
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:05,110
afford the same thing to different

338
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,560
organisms. So for example,

339
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,774
soil to a human agent might afford

340
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:13,466
walking on or laying down on, but to an

341
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:15,290
Earthworm it affords very different

342
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,234
things. And also, even amongst the same

343
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:20,220
organisms with humans, especially,

344
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,926
different surfaces and features of the

345
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:24,462
environment will afford different things

346
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:26,560
depending on your particular skill set.

347
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,662
And agents are going to go about

348
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:31,886
minimizing their uncertainty, so

349
00:13:31,988 --> 00:13:34,266
minimizing prediction errors, staying

350
00:13:34,298 --> 00:13:36,126
attuned to their environment through an

351
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,546
engagement with affordances. And this is

352
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,146
going to be something that is going to

353
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:41,986
drift away slightly as we move through

354
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:43,218
some sections and then it's going to

355
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:46,306
come back very heavily at the end. And I

356
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,562
should say that the idea of affordances,

357
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:50,646
to my knowledge, it first emerges in the

358
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:53,554
work of James Gibson the Ecological

359
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:55,366
Approach to Visual Perception. I think

360
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:57,046
it's chapter eight in that book that

361
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:59,530
really lays out a theory of affordances.

362
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,756
So this idea that systems or

363
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:10,104
organisms maintain their organization

364
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:13,436
through ongoing action means that

365
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,164
active inference has been labeled as

366
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:17,300
quintessentially inactive by Karl

367
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,736
Friston's. And I think that this is a

368
00:14:20,758 --> 00:14:23,740
nice inactivism is an older framework

369
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,496
from theoretical cognitive science and I

370
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:29,236
think it's a nice way to understand some

371
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:31,216
of the key features of active inference.

372
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,252
But it does come with a little bit of

373
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:35,348
historical philosophical baggage. And

374
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:36,904
I'm going to try and unpack that really

375
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:40,520
quickly because I want to unpack exactly

376
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,764
what it is that we're committing

377
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:43,752
ourselves to when we think about

378
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:46,090
cognition in activist terms.

379
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,104
So inactivism comes in various strands

380
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:52,924
very, very quickly and roughly, you have

381
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:55,976
autopoietic inactivism, which commits

382
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:57,772
itself to what's known as the mind life

383
00:14:57,826 --> 00:15:00,200
continuity thesis. This is essentially

384
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,884
that the structures that give a ground

385
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:06,892
to life itself are the same structures

386
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:09,840
that instantiate cognitive processes.

387
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,420
Sensing on this view is teleological

388
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,784
because it's oriented around supporting

389
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,596
vital systems. So things in the

390
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,932
environment have intrinsic meaning to

391
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,044
the organism because they support the

392
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:26,036
vital functioning of the organism in

393
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,828
some way. Sensory motor in activism

394
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:32,884
emphasizes how mobile and embodied

395
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,212
agents essentially enact the grounds

396
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:38,132
and conditions for their own sensory

397
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:40,412
engagements with the world. So the world

398
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:42,860
is not a kind of neutral static given

399
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,564
that we're parachuted into actually the

400
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:47,596
conditions through which we sense the

401
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:50,924
world are the conditions that we

402
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:53,488
can move and kind of interact with the

403
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,828
world in various ways and then there's

404
00:15:56,844 --> 00:16:00,672
radical enactivism. And this is the

405
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,956
view that cognition is purely grounded

406
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:04,864
in these agent environment dynamics.

407
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:07,076
It's a purely dynamicist account of

408
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:10,000
cognition and there's no role whatsoever

409
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,868
for internal representations. So

410
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:15,296
certainly in certain brands of sensory

411
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:17,492
motor in enactivism there remains a role

412
00:16:17,556 --> 00:16:20,328
for internal manipulation of

413
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:22,436
representations. And mental

414
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:24,952
representations are just mental states

415
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:27,240
that are about something in the world.

416
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,712
So some mental state is reconstructing

417
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:33,228
some feature of the world. And this all

418
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:36,236
harks back to kind of old debates in

419
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:38,268
philosophy of cognitive science between

420
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:41,288
internalist notions of cognition and

421
00:16:41,394 --> 00:16:44,640
more embodied, embedded, extended and

422
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,616
we'll take more of a look at that in a

423
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:49,856
second. But the question here is what

424
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,970
are we committing ourselves to with

425
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,928
active inference? And I need to be a

426
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:56,580
little bit careful because I think that

427
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,084
people are going to disagree with this

428
00:16:58,122 --> 00:16:59,300
to certain extents.

429
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,704
But I think we're certainly committing

430
00:17:02,752 --> 00:17:04,512
ourselves to sensory motor in activism.

431
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:06,384
I think that's fairly uncontroversial.

432
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:09,064
And I would say as well that the

433
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:10,728
underpinning of active inference by the

434
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:13,560
free energy principle by my lights also

435
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,424
commits us or it certainly chimes very

436
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:18,984
deeply with the core tenets of

437
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:22,264
autopoetic inactivism. But I think

438
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:24,024
what's really interesting in trying to

439
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:25,508
understand cognition in the active

440
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:27,544
inference agent is to understand what

441
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:28,824
role, if any, there are for

442
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:32,912
representations. So if you

443
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:34,604
have any familiarity with the literature

444
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:36,560
on active inference, you'll know that

445
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,560
active inference people are always

446
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,556
banging on about models, prediction

447
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:43,676
errors, various other computationally

448
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:46,772
sounding things. And so the worry here

449
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:49,604
is at least for well, it's not

450
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:51,604
necessarily a worry, but the thought

451
00:17:51,642 --> 00:17:54,276
would be are we committing ourselves to

452
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:56,304
a form of cognitivism? And again,

453
00:17:56,362 --> 00:17:59,524
cognitivism is this it's generally

454
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:03,236
considered to be an old fashioned notion

455
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:06,856
of cognition as like computation over

456
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:09,204
symbolic representations in the brain

457
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:11,544
according to some syntactic set of rules

458
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:15,116
or something. And typically over the

459
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:16,984
last couple of decades in cognitive

460
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:18,444
science people have been moving away

461
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:20,396
from that view. So it would be

462
00:18:20,418 --> 00:18:21,624
interesting if we were committing

463
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:23,984
ourselves to something that we'd already

464
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:26,144
moved away from and some people think

465
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:28,512
that we are making that commitment. So

466
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,296
Jakob Hohwy, for example, has argued in

467
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,080
various places that essentially

468
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,336
predictive processing or enactive

469
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:38,512
inference commits us to these very rich

470
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,084
reconstructive notions of

471
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:43,216
representation. And even Andy Clark,

472
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:47,136
Jakob Howie's foil in many places

473
00:18:47,248 --> 00:18:49,256
has said himself that he thinks that

474
00:18:49,278 --> 00:18:50,936
representations play a role here as

475
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:54,536
well. So in a talk in 2016, Clark said

476
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,336
it's internal representation. I think it

477
00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:59,340
is. These are representation using

478
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,976
stories, but it's not internal

479
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,236
representation in quite the way that we

480
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:06,616
originally thought about it. So there's

481
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:08,732
some differences, perhaps major

482
00:19:08,786 --> 00:19:10,344
differences between Howie and Clark

483
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:12,656
there, but others have pushed back. So

484
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:14,576
there's a paper by Maxwell Ramstead and

485
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:16,656
colleagues from 2020, I think it's the

486
00:19:16,678 --> 00:19:19,664
tale of two densities paper where they

487
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:22,850
say that

488
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,104
a proper understanding of the generative

489
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:27,476
models in active inference suggests that

490
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:30,404
there's no role for representations. So

491
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:32,470
this is the kind of anti Howie view.

492
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,544
So I really like this paper from

493
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:41,796
Avel Constant and Andy Clark and Karl

494
00:19:41,828 --> 00:19:44,184
Friston's which essentially tries to

495
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:46,644
broker some kind of peace in a debate

496
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:48,584
that in some form or another has been

497
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:51,404
raging for decades. So it'd be quite

498
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:54,108
nice to finally put this to bed.

499
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:56,876
So they argue that we can find, in the

500
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:58,812
formalisms of active inference, we can

501
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:01,150
find grounds for an armistice here.

502
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,656
So they argue that the formalisms of

503
00:20:04,678 --> 00:20:06,748
active inference show that, quote

504
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:08,268
representational and non

505
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:10,576
representational cognitive processes can

506
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:12,828
be implemented by the brain under active

507
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,376
inference. And they do this by showing

508
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:17,348
that active inference accommodates a

509
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:20,468
dual architecture. So they show that on

510
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:24,548
the one hand, in some sense the

511
00:20:24,634 --> 00:20:27,592
brain has to represent because under

512
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:30,036
active inference action selection

513
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:32,644
policies are happening over extended

514
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:34,696
timescales and so the agent has to

515
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:36,644
engage in some kind of counterfactual

516
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:39,272
thinking. So if I do X, what happens?

517
00:20:39,326 --> 00:20:41,996
If I do, y what happens? And so on. And

518
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:43,836
the argument, very roughly speaking, is

519
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:45,356
that that is going to entail some kind

520
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,516
of representational, some use of

521
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,636
representations. But on the other hand,

522
00:20:50,738 --> 00:20:53,244
they argue that what they call deontic

523
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,344
actions are processed through different

524
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:57,216
mappings in the generative model and

525
00:20:57,238 --> 00:20:58,924
they're directly triggered by sensory

526
00:20:58,972 --> 00:21:01,676
input. So a deontic action is an action

527
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,376
that is ingrained by our sense of the

528
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,100
expectations of others. So the example

529
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,036
that the authors use is stopping at some

530
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:11,988
red traffic lights in the middle of the

531
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:13,828
night when there's nobody else around.

532
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:18,072
So in a sense the claim is that through

533
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:21,690
a kind of social conditioning we know

534
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,648
what other people would expect us to do

535
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:27,236
in those circumstances and that allows

536
00:21:27,268 --> 00:21:30,920
for this kind of dynamic reflexive

537
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,780
action policy setting.

538
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,756
And in those cases there's no room for

539
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:39,116
representative or there's no need for

540
00:21:39,138 --> 00:21:42,290
representations there. I would

541
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,688
definitely suggest people interested in

542
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:48,336
this go and read this paper because you

543
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:49,376
might already have thought of some

544
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:52,844
potential objections here to the claim

545
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:54,516
that representations aren't needed for

546
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:56,644
deontic action and they do go into some

547
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,672
detail in talking about potential

548
00:21:58,736 --> 00:21:59,910
objections there.

549
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,296
So that's the kind of status of the role

550
00:22:05,328 --> 00:22:08,948
of representations. It's a live debate,

551
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:12,056
not everybody agrees. But it certainly

552
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:15,016
looks as though active inference has the

553
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,308
formal tools to accommodate both sides

554
00:22:18,324 --> 00:22:19,976
of the debate. And it might turn out

555
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:22,236
that that's a good thing because we can

556
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,556
make everybody happy or it might turn

557
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:26,236
out to be a bad thing because you might

558
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:27,576
think, well, we've not really settled

559
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:31,408
anything one way or another. I wanted to

560
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:33,970
take some time, though, to mention

561
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,984
extended active inference. So I've been

562
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:41,676
talking about inactivism and I've

563
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:42,832
mentioned this debate between

564
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:45,632
cognitiveism and older ways of thinking

565
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:48,164
about sorry, cognitiveism and newer ways

566
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,432
of thinking about cognition as embodied

567
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,708
or embedded. And these are part of

568
00:22:52,714 --> 00:22:54,736
what's known as the four E paradigm.

569
00:22:54,848 --> 00:22:58,084
And clearly I think we are talking about

570
00:22:58,122 --> 00:23:01,764
inactive cognition and you get embodied

571
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:03,992
and embedded kind of for free with this.

572
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:06,216
So the only one left on the table is the

573
00:23:06,238 --> 00:23:08,616
extended mind. And this is just the

574
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:12,684
claim that under some conditions the

575
00:23:12,802 --> 00:23:16,344
system that's realizing

576
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:18,872
cognitive processing can literally

577
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:21,816
extend outwards from the mind. So I'll

578
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:23,904
put some nice read ins for this up if

579
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:25,984
anybody's unfamiliar and interested.

580
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:28,044
But it's usually the most controversial

581
00:23:28,092 --> 00:23:32,092
of the four E's. And Andy Clark,

582
00:23:32,156 --> 00:23:33,648
who is one of the original authors of

583
00:23:33,654 --> 00:23:36,464
the extended mind paper, really thinks

584
00:23:36,512 --> 00:23:39,876
that active inference accommodates the

585
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:42,196
extended mind theory. And it's not just

586
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:44,244
that it accommodates it, but it actually

587
00:23:44,442 --> 00:23:46,704
solves some old problems in the extended

588
00:23:46,752 --> 00:23:49,560
mind about knowing how and why the brain

589
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,176
knows when and where to recruit certain

590
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,376
extra neural resources. And part of

591
00:23:56,398 --> 00:23:58,036
the argument for this, what really sits

592
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:00,824
at the core is Clark develops this

593
00:24:00,862 --> 00:24:02,236
argument based on the fact that the

594
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:03,864
generative models in active inference

595
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:06,076
are always in this, always making a

596
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:07,964
trade off between accuracy and

597
00:24:08,002 --> 00:24:10,828
complexity. So you want your model of

598
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:13,776
the world to be accurate enough that you

599
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:16,464
can act effectively on the world, but

600
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:19,356
you also want to minimize the metabolic

601
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:21,484
costs of having models that are overly

602
00:24:21,532 --> 00:24:24,868
complex. And so Clark utilizes this

603
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:28,340
insight to make the case that this

604
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:32,436
explains that in some cases as agents we

605
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,716
make use of these extra neural kind of

606
00:24:35,738 --> 00:24:39,304
props and tools and things. And he says

607
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:41,076
that the imperative to reduce

608
00:24:41,108 --> 00:24:43,652
uncertainty provides a location neutral

609
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:46,372
cost function that's always been missing

610
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:48,356
from the older arguments around extended

611
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:51,996
mind. So the upshot to

612
00:24:52,018 --> 00:24:54,428
this, I think, is that you end up with a

613
00:24:54,434 --> 00:24:57,356
view of agents as deeply coupled with

614
00:24:57,378 --> 00:24:59,416
their environments. So under active

615
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:02,328
inference it's just nonsensical to try

616
00:25:02,354 --> 00:25:04,336
and think about agents as decoupled from

617
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:06,556
their environment. The generative models

618
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,120
themselves are of the dynamics between

619
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,264
the agent and the environment. So these

620
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,280
two things can't be decoupled

621
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,316
perception, action loops. So remember I

622
00:25:17,338 --> 00:25:18,688
said that perceptual and active

623
00:25:18,704 --> 00:25:20,324
inference are essentially the same

624
00:25:20,362 --> 00:25:22,624
thing. They're part of this circular

625
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:24,996
causality and they see the agent

626
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:27,720
constantly producing their own worlds.

627
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,036
They occupy the states that they're

628
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:32,040
expecting to through action.

629
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,136
And we might think, based on the

630
00:25:36,158 --> 00:25:37,624
literature that I've gone through, that

631
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,292
there's some role here for

632
00:25:39,346 --> 00:25:42,312
representations. So we're not committing

633
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:45,980
ourselves. The active inference agent

634
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,160
is not one that fits with very radical

635
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,100
interpretations of inactivism.

636
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,972
And active inference agents are porous.

637
00:25:57,116 --> 00:25:59,324
They're open to recruiting external

638
00:25:59,372 --> 00:26:01,376
material features of the environment to

639
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:04,704
reduce complexity and therefore minimize

640
00:26:04,752 --> 00:26:07,572
the metabolic costs of realizing those

641
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:08,790
expected states.

642
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,750
Okay,

643
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,054
so that was a bit of active inference

644
00:26:19,102 --> 00:26:21,006
set against the backdrop of some older

645
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,558
questions in philosophy of mind

646
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,978
theoretical cognitive science. But I'm

647
00:26:24,994 --> 00:26:27,126
going to jump straight into agency and

648
00:26:27,148 --> 00:26:28,678
motivation now because there's a lot to

649
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:31,686
get through here. I'm going to start

650
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,946
with a dark room problem. This is a

651
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,678
canonical philosophical worry in active

652
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:38,426
inference. So a lot of people, I think,

653
00:26:38,448 --> 00:26:40,714
will be familiar with this. And in

654
00:26:40,752 --> 00:26:42,426
really brief terms, it's really easy to

655
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:45,500
state. The challenge here is to say,

656
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,074
if it's all about minimizing prediction

657
00:26:48,122 --> 00:26:49,934
error, why don't we just find the most

658
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:51,806
predictable environments possible and

659
00:26:51,828 --> 00:26:54,014
stay there and live a nice error free

660
00:26:54,052 --> 00:26:57,294
life? So Andy Clark paints a picture of

661
00:26:57,332 --> 00:26:59,346
a dark room, and you can just be

662
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,854
strapped up to an intravenous drip,

663
00:27:01,902 --> 00:27:03,714
feeding you the nutrients you need, and

664
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:05,874
you can just be really happy. But

665
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:08,238
clearly, we don't do that. Active

666
00:27:08,254 --> 00:27:10,402
inference sorry. Agents in the world,

667
00:27:10,456 --> 00:27:13,686
us, we generally typically sometimes we

668
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:15,478
do enjoy dark rooms, but most of the

669
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:17,366
time we don't for any extended period of

670
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:19,702
time. And so there's a challenge here

671
00:27:19,756 --> 00:27:22,074
about how active inference can account

672
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:25,702
for what appear to be motivated agential

673
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:28,646
actions that necessarily mean we're

674
00:27:28,678 --> 00:27:29,866
confronted with some degree of

675
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:33,002
uncertainty. And I'm going to set

676
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:34,814
active inference up in a kind of

677
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:37,166
dialectic with folk psychology here,

678
00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:39,790
because folk psychology faces no such

679
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,586
concerns. So, to be very clear, folk

680
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:45,534
psychology is just the kind of

681
00:27:45,572 --> 00:27:48,658
propositional linguistic framework that

682
00:27:48,744 --> 00:27:51,838
the folk use to talk about and describe

683
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:54,914
motivated action. So it's a language we

684
00:27:55,112 --> 00:27:57,826
typically use every day to describe the

685
00:27:57,848 --> 00:28:01,346
reasons people are doing things. So folk

686
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:03,202
psychology has this belief, desire,

687
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,894
intention, schema, where, if I want to

688
00:28:05,932 --> 00:28:09,490
explain, my friend going to grab a beer.

689
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,906
I would say, my friend believes there's

690
00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:14,182
beer in the fridge. My friend desires

691
00:28:14,246 --> 00:28:17,002
beer. And so those are combined to form

692
00:28:17,056 --> 00:28:18,986
the intention to go and get beer. So

693
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:20,838
folk psychology doesn't have these kinds

694
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:24,586
of problems. So just

695
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:25,802
a little bit more on the dark room

696
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:29,566
problem and another whale. So the

697
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:31,294
dark room problem invites more than one

698
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:32,814
answer. We're going to see more than one

699
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:35,454
answer to it as we go along. One

700
00:28:35,492 --> 00:28:37,674
response is to talk about what drives

701
00:28:37,722 --> 00:28:40,418
curiosity and play and exploration, and

702
00:28:40,584 --> 00:28:42,594
we are going to see more of that. But

703
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:44,494
the first response offered by Friston

704
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:46,546
Thornton and Clark is to highlight the

705
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:49,634
fact that organisms have basic needs to

706
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:51,926
eat, drink, and reproduce what you might

707
00:28:51,948 --> 00:28:54,550
call evolutionarily ingrained needs,

708
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,134
and that those needs are going to

709
00:28:56,172 --> 00:28:58,194
necessitate some form of exploratory

710
00:28:58,242 --> 00:29:00,630
behavior. So staying in the dark room

711
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,114
will inevitably, under most

712
00:29:03,152 --> 00:29:06,182
circumstances, going to lead to physical

713
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,210
dissipation.

714
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,826
So the question is, are these kinds of

715
00:29:12,848 --> 00:29:16,426
appeals enough? And I

716
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:18,554
wanted to pull up a paper by Colin Klein

717
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:21,102
2018 that I think is like a really nice

718
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:22,570
articulation of these challenges.

719
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,606
Ultimately, I think he's wrong and it

720
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:26,990
falls flat, but I think it's a strong

721
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,746
articulation. So Klein argues that

722
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,610
predictions alone simply can't account

723
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,434
for the motivational character of these

724
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,754
needs. So Klein says, look, it's fine

725
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:38,398
that you've got these needs. Nobody's

726
00:29:38,414 --> 00:29:40,966
going to deny that, but you just have

727
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:44,614
this one primitive to describe how

728
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:46,946
those needs motivate you, and prediction

729
00:29:46,978 --> 00:29:48,342
is just not going to do it. So

730
00:29:48,396 --> 00:29:50,642
prediction alone, as your sole primitive

731
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:52,634
is not going to be able it's like

732
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:54,234
predicting is not the same thing as

733
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:55,900
being motivated by something.

734
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,794
And Klein is really not happy with

735
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,466
appeals to these phenotypic needs.

736
00:30:03,648 --> 00:30:06,442
And he construes these in the relevance

737
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:08,606
of the evolutionary history of the

738
00:30:08,628 --> 00:30:11,038
organism and goes into a little bit of

739
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:13,934
detail. So he says, look, these

740
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:15,806
expectations are either going to be

741
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:19,314
about states, possible states, so the

742
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:22,542
state of being fed or clothed or warm,

743
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:24,162
or they're going to be about state

744
00:30:24,216 --> 00:30:26,334
transitions, about what the appropriate

745
00:30:26,382 --> 00:30:28,786
action is in one state to move to

746
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:32,130
another state. And he says expectations

747
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,646
about states themselves aren't going to

748
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:37,366
work because you have this problem of

749
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:39,846
accounting for novelty. So it might be

750
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:42,214
the case that in my evolutionary past,

751
00:30:42,332 --> 00:30:44,922
all of my ancestors have had the same

752
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,838
expectations about which states they're

753
00:30:46,854 --> 00:30:49,306
going to occupy. But there are lots of

754
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:52,106
states in my life that I could be

755
00:30:52,128 --> 00:30:54,586
motivated to occupy that there's simply

756
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:57,280
no evolutionary history to account for.

757
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,998
And he says there's a very similar or

758
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:02,222
similarly difficult problem with state

759
00:31:02,276 --> 00:31:04,938
transitions where essentially what we're

760
00:31:04,954 --> 00:31:06,606
talking about with state transitions are

761
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:09,662
the most appropriate actions. So I have

762
00:31:09,716 --> 00:31:11,838
expectations about the actions that are

763
00:31:11,844 --> 00:31:13,730
going to fill foot that I need to take

764
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,066
under certain circumstances that are

765
00:31:16,088 --> 00:31:18,094
going to get me to a particular expected

766
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:21,506
state. And Klein's worry is that there's

767
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:22,838
just going to be too many possible

768
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,046
actions in any given situation. So

769
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:29,186
there's just a kind of explosion

770
00:31:29,378 --> 00:31:31,214
that's just going to be unaccountable

771
00:31:31,282 --> 00:31:33,178
for. There's just going to be too many

772
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:35,574
different ways of getting to an expected

773
00:31:35,622 --> 00:31:39,338
state that we won't be able to

774
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:42,970
account for in our past. So it's fairly

775
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:47,358
robust, thorough challenge built on the

776
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:50,160
dark room problem. And I think actually

777
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,440
it's a worry with two faces. So I think

778
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,294
the first is about how active inference

779
00:31:57,342 --> 00:31:59,874
can describe agential behavior with its

780
00:31:59,912 --> 00:32:02,674
austere, purely doxastic landscape. So

781
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,362
if you imagine somebody looking at their

782
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:08,354
house burning down, it seems like you

783
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:11,298
need more than beliefs to explain any

784
00:32:11,384 --> 00:32:13,206
course of action they take. So there has

785
00:32:13,228 --> 00:32:15,846
to be desire in there somewhere. So this

786
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:17,926
is an example Andy Clark uses in one of

787
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:21,000
his papers. And he know

788
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,154
the desire to run in and rescue some

789
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:28,074
item that you want from the house or the

790
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,114
desire to claim on the insurance is the

791
00:32:31,152 --> 00:32:32,714
thing that's. Going to dictate how you

792
00:32:32,752 --> 00:32:35,418
explain the person's behavior. So that's

793
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:38,094
the first problem. We need to look at

794
00:32:38,132 --> 00:32:41,438
how folk psychology tessellates with

795
00:32:41,604 --> 00:32:44,720
prediction. And the other problem is

796
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,346
maybe a little bit deeper, and that's to

797
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:49,586
ask, how does active inference actually

798
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:52,674
account for agential behavior? So can we

799
00:32:52,712 --> 00:32:54,834
even tell some story using just

800
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,898
predictions and prediction error about

801
00:32:56,984 --> 00:32:59,880
what really moves agents to act?

802
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,346
So firstly, thinking about folk

803
00:33:03,378 --> 00:33:05,366
psychology, there's a couple of ways to

804
00:33:05,388 --> 00:33:07,542
go here and I think ultimately we can

805
00:33:07,596 --> 00:33:10,726
answer this worry. So Ryan Smith and

806
00:33:10,748 --> 00:33:13,946
colleagues in 2022 in their paper

807
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:15,594
active inference models do not

808
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:18,326
contradict folk psychology. They argue

809
00:33:18,358 --> 00:33:20,630
that the formalisms of active inference

810
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,014
can accommodate a belief desire

811
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:26,218
distinction. Now, I'll admit that it's a

812
00:33:26,224 --> 00:33:27,966
very math heavy paper and it's a little

813
00:33:27,988 --> 00:33:30,446
bit beyond my capabilities, but the

814
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:32,014
claim here is simply that there's no

815
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,522
contradiction. That actually the worry

816
00:33:34,586 --> 00:33:36,666
that the important thing we have in folk

817
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:39,154
psychology is desire. And we're not

818
00:33:39,192 --> 00:33:40,706
getting that in active inference. This

819
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:43,598
is just an unfounded worry. But there's

820
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:45,854
another strategy as well. So Joe

821
00:33:45,902 --> 00:33:49,326
Dewhurst, in his 2017 paper, he employs

822
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:51,494
a different strategy and he says, look,

823
00:33:51,692 --> 00:33:53,666
what are we even doing with folk

824
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,134
psychology? Let's not kind of be too

825
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:59,126
hasty and we need to think about what

826
00:33:59,148 --> 00:34:01,826
are we doing when we talk about these

827
00:34:01,868 --> 00:34:03,820
propositional kind of states.

828
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,954
So he says the first option is to say,

829
00:34:06,992 --> 00:34:08,842
well, we're just being realists here.

830
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:12,486
So when I say that X desires Y, I'm

831
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:15,354
actually positing the real existence as

832
00:34:15,392 --> 00:34:18,880
a fine grained mental state in X's head.

833
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,246
And he thinks that this is actually the

834
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,686
wrong way to think about things. He

835
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,262
thinks that folk psychology actually

836
00:34:25,316 --> 00:34:27,646
it's an instrumentalist tool. It's a

837
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,066
kind of framework that we use just for

838
00:34:30,088 --> 00:34:32,126
picking out coarse grained behavioral

839
00:34:32,158 --> 00:34:35,666
patterns in some useful way. So if we

840
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:37,426
agree with Duhurst here and we just

841
00:34:37,448 --> 00:34:38,986
become instrumentalists about folk

842
00:34:39,038 --> 00:34:41,334
psychology again, it looks as though

843
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:44,246
there's different we're not forced to

844
00:34:44,268 --> 00:34:47,174
kind of worry that there's some kind of

845
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:48,918
empirical problem here where the

846
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:51,574
mechanisms of enactive inference are in

847
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:54,298
some sense incommensurable with real

848
00:34:54,464 --> 00:34:56,426
properties that we're positing the

849
00:34:56,448 --> 00:34:57,898
existence of. Because we're just going

850
00:34:57,904 --> 00:34:59,274
to say that those things don't really

851
00:34:59,312 --> 00:35:01,094
exist in the way that we've typically

852
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:04,830
assumed that they might. So either

853
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,342
way, whichever route you go down here,

854
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,710
it looks like active inference agents

855
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,846
have beliefs and that we're going to be

856
00:35:12,868 --> 00:35:15,710
fine in describing motivated action.

857
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,940
So what about the second problem?

858
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,650
So Andy Clark in 2020 authored a direct

859
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,798
response decline. So Clark wants

860
00:35:28,824 --> 00:35:31,506
to argue that actually using predictions

861
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:33,714
and prediction errors and precision

862
00:35:33,762 --> 00:35:35,766
weighting, which I'll explain in a

863
00:35:35,788 --> 00:35:39,586
second, we can get a picture of agential

864
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:40,390
action.

865
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,610
So the first thing Clark does is to

866
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,558
outline the fact that under active

867
00:35:47,574 --> 00:35:51,654
inference we have a very nice, well worn

868
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:53,914
account of embodied action. So, in other

869
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,062
words, what it takes to actually move

870
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:58,302
the body to perform different actions is

871
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,714
perfectly folded into active inference

872
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:02,970
under the same kind of computational

873
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,226
flow of prediction error minimization.

874
00:36:05,418 --> 00:36:07,966
Just in a nutshell, for me to move my

875
00:36:07,988 --> 00:36:09,618
arm, what I'm doing is making a

876
00:36:09,624 --> 00:36:11,374
prediction that my arm is in someplace

877
00:36:11,422 --> 00:36:13,294
and then minimizing the prediction

878
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:16,658
error. So once that's on

879
00:36:16,664 --> 00:36:18,962
the table, Clark says, OK, that's fine,

880
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,566
we have this account of action, but

881
00:36:20,588 --> 00:36:23,686
that's not really what Klein means. So

882
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:25,814
the move Clark makes is to appeal to the

883
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:28,326
hierarchical nested structure of the

884
00:36:28,348 --> 00:36:30,982
generative model and to say that higher

885
00:36:31,036 --> 00:36:33,782
level beliefs, which are about

886
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:36,138
temporarily extended future states,

887
00:36:36,304 --> 00:36:37,754
these are going to perform a really

888
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:40,006
important role as a kind of controller

889
00:36:40,038 --> 00:36:42,666
for lower level actions. So the idea is

890
00:36:42,688 --> 00:36:45,694
that if I have a high level,

891
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:48,622
temporarily extended expectation to

892
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:51,966
attain a PhD, what happens is that high

893
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:55,022
level belief becomes unpacked at lower

894
00:36:55,076 --> 00:36:57,314
levels in the hierarchy, and what you

895
00:36:57,352 --> 00:37:00,894
get are more fine grained, faster action

896
00:37:00,942 --> 00:37:03,890
policies that the system expects to help

897
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,130
support that higher level expectation.

898
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:09,414
And there's a mechanism in play here

899
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:11,094
called precision weighting, which

900
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:14,242
applies to prediction error signals,

901
00:37:14,306 --> 00:37:18,614
because obviously not

902
00:37:18,652 --> 00:37:20,406
all of the predictions we make about the

903
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:22,306
environment are going to be equally

904
00:37:22,418 --> 00:37:24,422
important. We're not going to have equal

905
00:37:24,486 --> 00:37:26,746
confidence in all of our actions to

906
00:37:26,768 --> 00:37:29,594
bring about an expected state. And so

907
00:37:29,632 --> 00:37:31,146
what precision weighting does is

908
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:32,842
essentially communicate how much

909
00:37:32,896 --> 00:37:35,598
confidence we have in a particular

910
00:37:35,764 --> 00:37:38,846
action policy to move us into that

911
00:37:38,868 --> 00:37:40,634
expected state under perceptual

912
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:43,054
inference. Precision weighting just

913
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:46,906
signals how newsworthy prediction errors

914
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:48,866
are, so how important they are for the

915
00:37:48,888 --> 00:37:51,374
system. So precision weighting drives

916
00:37:51,422 --> 00:37:53,998
attention, for example, when we're

917
00:37:54,014 --> 00:37:55,566
talking about predictive processing.

918
00:37:55,678 --> 00:37:58,402
But in this case, Clark's claim is that

919
00:37:58,536 --> 00:38:01,074
when you have this kind of nested

920
00:38:01,122 --> 00:38:03,574
hierarchy of expectations, so you have

921
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:05,926
temporarily extended expectations at the

922
00:38:05,948 --> 00:38:09,190
high level, unpacked into a kind of web

923
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,338
of lower level action policies. And

924
00:38:12,444 --> 00:38:14,918
precision waiting is kind of modulating

925
00:38:15,014 --> 00:38:17,386
the system's expectations about which of

926
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:19,386
those policies are most likely to bring

927
00:38:19,408 --> 00:38:22,074
about the expected states. You get

928
00:38:22,112 --> 00:38:24,430
something that looks a lot like

929
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:29,002
motivated directed action. And agency

930
00:38:29,146 --> 00:38:31,726
is kind of inherent in this model

931
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:35,678
because the system rather

932
00:38:35,764 --> 00:38:40,514
has to model itself as a cause of

933
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:43,666
those expected states. So if I have

934
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,978
these high level expectations, I, in a

935
00:38:46,984 --> 00:38:49,410
very inherent way, have to model my own

936
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,966
causal efficacy to bring about those

937
00:38:52,008 --> 00:38:55,366
states. So on a very low level, the

938
00:38:55,388 --> 00:38:57,926
system has to model some form of agent

939
00:38:58,028 --> 00:38:59,894
because I can be the cause of change to

940
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:01,926
my own sensory states, so I can cover my

941
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:04,346
own eyes and so on and so forth. So kind

942
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:07,866
of on this view, agency is a

943
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:10,506
latent variable in these systems when

944
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:12,506
it's making these predictions, so it

945
00:39:12,528 --> 00:39:16,042
just kind of turns up. And Clark

946
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,718
argues that you essentially end up with

947
00:39:18,804 --> 00:39:20,800
something that looks very much like

948
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:24,286
agents under folk psychology. But he

949
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:26,046
thinks this is a better view because we

950
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:28,578
end up with a, quote, different and

951
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:31,214
arguably much more unified internal

952
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:33,522
architecture trading in a single

953
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:36,610
currency. So Clark thinks, look, okay,

954
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,354
Klein's worry is we have this one

955
00:39:38,392 --> 00:39:41,426
primitive. We have just prediction. And

956
00:39:41,528 --> 00:39:42,998
the concern is that we're not going to

957
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:45,094
be able to explain agential action. But

958
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,446
actually there are ways that we can

959
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,318
appeal to the hierarchical structure of

960
00:39:49,324 --> 00:39:51,734
the model and precision weighting. And

961
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:53,274
it turns out that this is a much more

962
00:39:53,312 --> 00:39:56,726
elegant picture as well. But Klein

963
00:39:56,758 --> 00:39:58,890
might press the worry, and anybody

964
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,034
listening might kind of think, well,

965
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,434
we've kind of done some work there, but

966
00:40:03,552 --> 00:40:05,614
why do we expect the things that we

967
00:40:05,652 --> 00:40:09,518
expect in the first place? So why

968
00:40:09,604 --> 00:40:12,446
is my long term expectation to attain a

969
00:40:12,468 --> 00:40:14,586
PhD and not to join the French Foreign

970
00:40:14,618 --> 00:40:17,106
Legion, for example? What means that I

971
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:19,300
expect one thing rather than another?

972
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,754
And here Clark just bites a bullet and

973
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:26,126
says, nobody can explain that. We've

974
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:27,730
kind of shifted to talking about

975
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,210
questions, know, spookier questions

976
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,582
about free will. And Clark says, look,

977
00:40:32,636 --> 00:40:34,486
if this is what you want, if this is

978
00:40:34,508 --> 00:40:36,326
what you're demanding, then you have to

979
00:40:36,348 --> 00:40:38,354
recognize that simply appealing to folks

980
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,120
psychology doesn't get you that,

981
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,470
know, people with these kinds

982
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,146
of worries need to be careful in how

983
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:49,158
much they demand from the active

984
00:40:49,174 --> 00:40:51,754
inference agent. And I think the real

985
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:53,226
answer to that question actually, this

986
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,794
is more speculative, but the real answer

987
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:56,586
to a deeper answer to these kinds of

988
00:40:56,608 --> 00:40:58,686
questions will lie in the kinds of

989
00:40:58,708 --> 00:40:59,886
things that we're going to look at in

990
00:40:59,908 --> 00:41:02,126
subsequent weeks. So, for example, the

991
00:41:02,148 --> 00:41:04,666
reason I have the expectation to attain

992
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:06,358
a PhD rather than join the French

993
00:41:06,394 --> 00:41:08,866
Foreign Legion is because I exist in a

994
00:41:08,888 --> 00:41:11,054
particular kind of sociocultural

995
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:14,834
landscape with specific norms, and a lot

996
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,966
of my actions and beliefs are tempered

997
00:41:17,998 --> 00:41:20,662
and shaped by the expectations of people

998
00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:24,006
around me. So this is

999
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:26,674
just an overview. We went over the dark

1000
00:41:26,722 --> 00:41:29,846
room problem. Why do we do anything at

1001
00:41:29,868 --> 00:41:33,034
all if it's all about certainty and

1002
00:41:33,072 --> 00:41:37,002
prediction error minimization this

1003
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:40,662
worry? I said you can kind of highlight

1004
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,826
two aspects of this worry. One is an

1005
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:45,066
actual account of agency under active

1006
00:41:45,098 --> 00:41:47,422
inference, which we have. We have this

1007
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:49,742
Andy Clark model of agency to do with

1008
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:52,874
hierarchical nested, unfolding action

1009
00:41:52,922 --> 00:41:54,702
policies over time and different

1010
00:41:54,756 --> 00:41:57,154
precision mappings. And then we have

1011
00:41:57,192 --> 00:41:58,866
this worry about the relationship with

1012
00:41:58,888 --> 00:42:02,530
folk psychology. So how do we describe

1013
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,822
agential behavior and motivated

1014
00:42:05,886 --> 00:42:07,186
behavior? How do we describe the

1015
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:09,362
behavior of agents if we only have

1016
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:11,970
recourse to prediction?

1017
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,974
And as we saw, there's one

1018
00:42:18,012 --> 00:42:19,586
argument here is that actually active

1019
00:42:19,618 --> 00:42:20,886
inference, the formalisms can

1020
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:22,194
accommodate this belief desire

1021
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:24,346
distinction. And the other move that I

1022
00:42:24,368 --> 00:42:26,486
really like is to just say, look, folk

1023
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:28,534
psychology is just this instrumental

1024
00:42:28,582 --> 00:42:32,074
tool. It is, in effect, it's part of the

1025
00:42:32,112 --> 00:42:34,686
sociocultural landscape that we use to

1026
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:37,918
shape each other's expectations by

1027
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:40,494
putting these labels to explain our

1028
00:42:40,532 --> 00:42:42,698
actions. This kind of form of active

1029
00:42:42,714 --> 00:42:45,598
inference itself. So there's this kind

1030
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,982
of philosophically interesting debate

1031
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:51,346
about folk psychology, but it

1032
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,522
turns out that everything's okay and

1033
00:42:53,576 --> 00:42:56,498
active inference agents are in fact

1034
00:42:56,584 --> 00:42:59,266
agents with beliefs, desires and hopes

1035
00:42:59,298 --> 00:43:00,920
and dreams and so on.

1036
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:06,374
Okay? That's agency. We're making

1037
00:43:06,412 --> 00:43:07,240
good time.

1038
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,490
Okay. So in this section I'm going to

1039
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,674
introduce quite a lot of stuff,

1040
00:43:17,872 --> 00:43:20,730
but it's going to be all tied together

1041
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,314
hopefully rather neatly in the case

1042
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:23,706
study. At the end, I'm going to talk

1043
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:26,638
about allostatis and emotion. I'm going

1044
00:43:26,644 --> 00:43:29,294
to say very briefly a little bit about

1045
00:43:29,332 --> 00:43:30,960
the self as well.

1046
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,858
Here's some examples of some of the core

1047
00:43:34,874 --> 00:43:36,446
readings I've used. Again, these are all

1048
00:43:36,468 --> 00:43:38,618
going to be up in the document as well,

1049
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:41,474
which will be made available. And I

1050
00:43:41,592 --> 00:43:43,058
thoroughly advise you to just have a

1051
00:43:43,064 --> 00:43:44,386
browse through these. There's some

1052
00:43:44,408 --> 00:43:46,994
really interesting stuff there. I'm not

1053
00:43:47,032 --> 00:43:50,200
going to talk about psychedelics or

1054
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,094
meditation or depersonalization, but

1055
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:55,186
there is some really cool active

1056
00:43:55,218 --> 00:43:57,286
inference literature on those topics as

1057
00:43:57,308 --> 00:43:58,694
well, particularly papers on

1058
00:43:58,732 --> 00:44:00,694
psychedelics and ego dissolution by

1059
00:44:00,732 --> 00:44:03,462
George Dean. A new paper just came out

1060
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:07,526
by inezito Jonas Mago

1061
00:44:07,558 --> 00:44:09,690
and Robert Carhartt harris and I think

1062
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,618
Fernando Rosas as well. I think I might

1063
00:44:12,704 --> 00:44:14,106
be mistaken on the authors there, but

1064
00:44:14,128 --> 00:44:17,630
it's a very new paper. Okay?

1065
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,798
So the thing that is going to underpin a

1066
00:44:20,804 --> 00:44:22,206
lot of what I'm now going to go on to

1067
00:44:22,228 --> 00:44:24,094
say is going to be this notion of

1068
00:44:24,132 --> 00:44:27,518
allostatis. And this

1069
00:44:27,604 --> 00:44:30,914
plays a major role in a lot of work

1070
00:44:30,952 --> 00:44:32,766
on emotion and the self in active

1071
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:35,662
inference. Lisa Feldman Barrett, whose

1072
00:44:35,726 --> 00:44:37,186
theory of emotion we're going to look at

1073
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:40,018
in a second, has argued that the brain's

1074
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:43,046
fundamental purpose, what it evolved to

1075
00:44:43,068 --> 00:44:45,474
do through that imperative to minimize

1076
00:44:45,522 --> 00:44:47,366
prediction error, is to manage the

1077
00:44:47,388 --> 00:44:50,374
body's metabolic budget. So the first

1078
00:44:50,492 --> 00:44:53,942
prior is kind of our most expected

1079
00:44:54,006 --> 00:44:57,210
state. The first prior in the sense of

1080
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,194
our strongest prior probability, our

1081
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:05,022
highest expectation is to have good

1082
00:45:05,076 --> 00:45:06,766
allostatic control. But I'm getting

1083
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:08,446
ahead of myself there. All that means is

1084
00:45:08,468 --> 00:45:10,298
that we're balancing our body's

1085
00:45:10,314 --> 00:45:13,406
metabolic budget, our energy budget, in

1086
00:45:13,428 --> 00:45:17,598
an effective way. So error

1087
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,314
signals, like I said before, that are

1088
00:45:19,352 --> 00:45:21,186
highly precise are those that are

1089
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:24,366
weighted very highly. So prediction

1090
00:45:24,398 --> 00:45:26,254
error signals that have high precision

1091
00:45:26,302 --> 00:45:29,474
weighting are the synaptic gain on those

1092
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:31,422
error signals is going to be increased

1093
00:45:31,486 --> 00:45:33,590
and that's going to drive learning,

1094
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,210
which means in future our expectations

1095
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,086
around those kinds of error signals is

1096
00:45:38,108 --> 00:45:39,414
going to be we're going to pay more

1097
00:45:39,452 --> 00:45:43,290
attention to those. And the most

1098
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,686
highly weighted error signals that we're

1099
00:45:45,718 --> 00:45:48,170
going to get are to do with our own

1100
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,634
homeostatic set points within our own

1101
00:45:50,672 --> 00:45:54,170
body. So if my temperature

1102
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,094
started to rise rapidly, my body

1103
00:45:56,132 --> 00:45:58,154
temperature started to rise or drop

1104
00:45:58,202 --> 00:46:02,266
rapidly, that prediction error signal,

1105
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:04,974
the violation of those expectations is

1106
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,538
really going to grab my attention and

1107
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:09,010
I'm going to do something about it. And

1108
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,394
one way that we maintain these

1109
00:46:11,432 --> 00:46:14,334
homeostatic states is through the body's

1110
00:46:14,382 --> 00:46:17,826
own autonomic reactions. So were I to

1111
00:46:17,848 --> 00:46:20,374
start getting very cold, I would

1112
00:46:20,412 --> 00:46:23,014
probably start to shiver. And so the

1113
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:25,974
body is trying to kind of rectify those

1114
00:46:26,012 --> 00:46:28,760
deviations from homeostatic set points.

1115
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,466
But another thing that organisms engage

1116
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,482
in, and humans do this to really

1117
00:46:35,536 --> 00:46:37,546
remarkable degrees. And again, this is

1118
00:46:37,568 --> 00:46:39,306
going to be something that I suspect is

1119
00:46:39,328 --> 00:46:40,614
going to come out in the subsequent

1120
00:46:40,662 --> 00:46:44,270
weeks, is that we engage in quite

1121
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,634
complex and sophisticated anticipatory

1122
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:49,850
actions to maintain homeostasis.

1123
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,350
And this is something called allostasis.

1124
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,598
So allostatic control, which I mentioned

1125
00:46:55,684 --> 00:46:58,290
earlier as this first prior,

1126
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,626
is essentially the regulation of

1127
00:47:00,648 --> 00:47:03,374
homeostasis through action. So it's

1128
00:47:03,422 --> 00:47:07,026
actions that I can take to ensure that

1129
00:47:07,048 --> 00:47:09,002
I stay within those important bounds.

1130
00:47:09,086 --> 00:47:13,142
So shivering is good, but living

1131
00:47:13,196 --> 00:47:14,774
in a house with central heating is

1132
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:18,278
better. Having a warm bed and

1133
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:20,502
living in a community where we've had

1134
00:47:20,556 --> 00:47:22,666
these people of kind of engineers have

1135
00:47:22,688 --> 00:47:24,950
worked to create a kind of material

1136
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:27,226
environment that acts as a kind of

1137
00:47:27,248 --> 00:47:28,954
background support to a lot of these

1138
00:47:28,992 --> 00:47:32,202
needs. Something that's another

1139
00:47:32,256 --> 00:47:34,634
important concept here is allostatic

1140
00:47:34,682 --> 00:47:37,566
load. So this is essentially the result

1141
00:47:37,668 --> 00:47:39,966
of not having good allostatic control.

1142
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:42,798
So again, allostatic control is just

1143
00:47:42,964 --> 00:47:45,406
engaging effectively in actions that are

1144
00:47:45,428 --> 00:47:47,822
maintaining those set points, whereas

1145
00:47:47,886 --> 00:47:50,110
allostatic load is the physiological

1146
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,514
costs to the agent of losing that

1147
00:47:52,552 --> 00:47:56,622
control. So there's so many studies

1148
00:47:56,686 --> 00:48:00,322
here that have just shown the immense

1149
00:48:00,386 --> 00:48:02,994
physiological costs of operating beyond

1150
00:48:03,042 --> 00:48:04,854
those set points and not having good

1151
00:48:04,892 --> 00:48:07,126
control. So allostatis load has been

1152
00:48:07,148 --> 00:48:10,646
linked with reduced cardiac health,

1153
00:48:10,748 --> 00:48:15,210
sleep problems, gut issues,

1154
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,530
mental health issues, depression,

1155
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,298
basically everything. It's really bad

1156
00:48:20,384 --> 00:48:23,622
and so good allostatic control is very

1157
00:48:23,696 --> 00:48:25,742
important and as we're going to see, it

1158
00:48:25,796 --> 00:48:27,758
underpins quite a few very important

1159
00:48:27,844 --> 00:48:28,480
things.

1160
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:34,926
So really we could

1161
00:48:34,948 --> 00:48:36,862
dedicate a whole hour to looking at

1162
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:39,374
emotion, but I'm going to blast through

1163
00:48:39,412 --> 00:48:42,034
it very quickly right now. And this

1164
00:48:42,072 --> 00:48:43,646
slide, I should say one of the core

1165
00:48:43,678 --> 00:48:45,566
readings on the document and the reading

1166
00:48:45,598 --> 00:48:48,366
that I'm basing this on is Lisa Feldman

1167
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:51,126
Barrett's 2017 paper, the Theory of

1168
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,030
Constructed Emotion.

1169
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,326
The main idea here is this is one of

1170
00:48:58,348 --> 00:49:00,006
those theories that on the face of it,

1171
00:49:00,028 --> 00:49:01,494
it seems quite simple, but actually

1172
00:49:01,532 --> 00:49:02,986
there's quite a lot of subtlety and

1173
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:06,282
nuance to it. Allostatis control

1174
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:08,986
means inferring the causes of changes to

1175
00:49:09,008 --> 00:49:11,466
the body's internal state. So in other

1176
00:49:11,488 --> 00:49:14,806
words, if I want to keep good allostatic

1177
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:17,526
control, I need to know not just what's

1178
00:49:17,558 --> 00:49:19,166
going on out there, but I need to know

1179
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:21,038
what's going on inside me as well.

1180
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,150
Okay? So if there's some crucial change

1181
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,406
happening, I need to be on top of it.

1182
00:49:25,508 --> 00:49:27,506
And this happens through exactly the

1183
00:49:27,528 --> 00:49:29,998
same process as the same enactive,

1184
00:49:30,094 --> 00:49:32,046
error, minimization process that I'm

1185
00:49:32,078 --> 00:49:34,242
engaging with with the outside world.

1186
00:49:34,376 --> 00:49:36,978
So the brain is making predictions about

1187
00:49:37,064 --> 00:49:39,658
its own internal states and then it's

1188
00:49:39,694 --> 00:49:42,834
going to engage in some kind of action

1189
00:49:42,882 --> 00:49:45,366
to minimize any prediction errors. And

1190
00:49:45,388 --> 00:49:46,646
these prediction errors are going to be

1191
00:49:46,668 --> 00:49:48,214
very highly weighted. They're very

1192
00:49:48,252 --> 00:49:51,558
important. But here's an interesting

1193
00:49:51,644 --> 00:49:54,882
thing. So there was a very unethical

1194
00:49:54,946 --> 00:49:58,502
experiment done by Shaktor and Singer,

1195
00:49:58,566 --> 00:50:01,194
I think in the 60s, who they were

1196
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:04,186
emotion researchers and they conducted

1197
00:50:04,218 --> 00:50:07,306
an experiment where they injected

1198
00:50:07,498 --> 00:50:09,194
subjects without the subject's

1199
00:50:09,242 --> 00:50:12,766
knowledge. I think they injected them

1200
00:50:12,788 --> 00:50:15,274
with adrenaline and then they exposed

1201
00:50:15,322 --> 00:50:18,494
the subjects to different stimuli.

1202
00:50:18,622 --> 00:50:20,914
So some subjects were exposed to one

1203
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:22,994
type of stimulus and some subjects were

1204
00:50:23,032 --> 00:50:25,666
exposed to another. And even though the

1205
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:30,226
subjects had essentially been they'd

1206
00:50:30,258 --> 00:50:31,734
been pushed to have the same, to

1207
00:50:31,772 --> 00:50:33,154
experience the same physiological

1208
00:50:33,202 --> 00:50:35,910
changes in their body, they reported

1209
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,786
different emotional like different kinds

1210
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:41,346
of feelings depending on the stimulus

1211
00:50:41,378 --> 00:50:44,298
that they'd been exposed to. So this

1212
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:46,058
highlights something really important.

1213
00:50:46,144 --> 00:50:48,186
And again, I feel compelled to say that

1214
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:50,534
I am moving through this incredibly

1215
00:50:50,582 --> 00:50:52,940
quickly. There's so much to say here.

1216
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,926
But the nub of it is this in

1217
00:50:56,948 --> 00:51:00,478
order to keep good allostatic control,

1218
00:51:00,564 --> 00:51:03,146
in order to know what to do, the brain

1219
00:51:03,178 --> 00:51:05,598
needs to contextualize those changes in

1220
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,626
the body because there's not a one to

1221
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,930
one mapping between changes in the body

1222
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,114
and an external stimulus. So sometimes

1223
00:51:14,232 --> 00:51:16,146
changes, physiological changes in our

1224
00:51:16,168 --> 00:51:18,530
body are about something in the world,

1225
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,406
they're a response to something. And

1226
00:51:21,448 --> 00:51:23,522
it's very, very important that the brain

1227
00:51:23,586 --> 00:51:26,502
is kind of taking a confluence of those

1228
00:51:26,556 --> 00:51:29,142
inputs to try and contextualize, okay,

1229
00:51:29,196 --> 00:51:31,046
what's actually happening and what do I

1230
00:51:31,068 --> 00:51:34,266
need to do? So an example of this is if

1231
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:37,066
you imagine running into a bear while

1232
00:51:37,088 --> 00:51:39,274
you're hiking in Wyoming, which is

1233
00:51:39,312 --> 00:51:40,506
something that's actually happened to

1234
00:51:40,528 --> 00:51:42,166
me, I've experienced it, it's

1235
00:51:42,198 --> 00:51:45,038
terrifying. And you imagine going on a

1236
00:51:45,044 --> 00:51:47,166
scary or a date that you're really

1237
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:50,682
nervous about. The physiological

1238
00:51:50,746 --> 00:51:52,462
changes that are happening in the body

1239
00:51:52,596 --> 00:51:55,326
are, give or take, more or less the

1240
00:51:55,348 --> 00:51:58,562
same. So perspiration, elevated heart

1241
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,820
rate, breathing changes.

1242
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,806
So the underlying physiological

1243
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:06,994
footprint is very similar. But what you

1244
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:09,206
need to do to manage that situation,

1245
00:52:09,308 --> 00:52:11,958
that apt action is very, very different.

1246
00:52:12,124 --> 00:52:15,126
And so the claim here, the kind of

1247
00:52:15,148 --> 00:52:17,782
revolutionary claim in a way is that

1248
00:52:17,836 --> 00:52:20,614
emotions, the things we experience

1249
00:52:20,732 --> 00:52:23,754
subjectively are constructions, just

1250
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:26,266
like percepts are. So just like my

1251
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:27,834
experience of the car when I step

1252
00:52:27,872 --> 00:52:30,490
outside my flat is a construction that

1253
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,226
explains away the prediction error and

1254
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:35,758
gives me a cleaned up picture of the

1255
00:52:35,764 --> 00:52:37,966
world. Emotions are essentially doing

1256
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,710
the same thing. They're explaining away

1257
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,174
these prediction errors and telling me

1258
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:45,022
this is the best explanation of these

1259
00:52:45,076 --> 00:52:47,662
changes within your body contextualized

1260
00:52:47,726 --> 00:52:50,418
against this external stimulus. So in

1261
00:52:50,424 --> 00:52:53,890
the case of the date, apt action is to

1262
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,762
chill out and be normal to a certain

1263
00:52:57,816 --> 00:53:00,190
extent. And in the case of the bear,

1264
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,046
you get the hell out of that. Although

1265
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,846
interestingly, you don't. Running away

1266
00:53:03,868 --> 00:53:06,166
from a bear is a terrible idea. You

1267
00:53:06,188 --> 00:53:07,990
should not turn your back and run away

1268
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,198
but you get the idea that it's going to

1269
00:53:10,204 --> 00:53:12,042
be what you should do in each situation

1270
00:53:12,096 --> 00:53:13,340
is completely different.

1271
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,326
So that's emotion for the active

1272
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:21,738
inference agent and something I

1273
00:53:21,744 --> 00:53:24,894
don't want to lose here is what you get

1274
00:53:24,932 --> 00:53:27,582
with this is really kind of cool because

1275
00:53:27,636 --> 00:53:30,538
it turns out emotions and subject we're

1276
00:53:30,554 --> 00:53:32,414
kind of moving into subjectivity here.

1277
00:53:32,532 --> 00:53:36,954
It turns out emotions are really they're

1278
00:53:37,002 --> 00:53:38,686
just part of the same cognitive

1279
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,658
architecture. So there's no difference

1280
00:53:40,744 --> 00:53:43,374
here. There's no dualism between here's

1281
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:45,486
thinking and here's emotion. And emotion

1282
00:53:45,518 --> 00:53:48,606
is this kind of fuzzy stuff that we're

1283
00:53:48,638 --> 00:53:50,326
not really interested in. Actually

1284
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:54,040
emotion, subjective embodied feeling is

1285
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:57,174
core. It's absolutely vital to

1286
00:53:57,212 --> 00:54:00,006
understanding how we maintain this

1287
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,386
allostatic control and how we engage in

1288
00:54:02,428 --> 00:54:05,318
adaptive behaviors and how we remain

1289
00:54:05,494 --> 00:54:08,026
gripped to our affordances in the

1290
00:54:08,048 --> 00:54:10,106
environment. And the notion of grip is

1291
00:54:10,128 --> 00:54:11,466
going to be something that comes up

1292
00:54:11,488 --> 00:54:12,620
again very soon.

1293
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:19,006
So very briefly, because this is

1294
00:54:19,028 --> 00:54:19,934
something that I've really already

1295
00:54:19,972 --> 00:54:21,518
talked about, but I want to put a

1296
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,520
slightly different spin on it right now.

1297
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,826
I've already said that allostatic

1298
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:29,602
control for humans can involve very

1299
00:54:29,736 --> 00:54:32,274
temporarily extended scales. And we saw

1300
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:35,906
this with Andy's model of agency. So if

1301
00:54:35,928 --> 00:54:37,250
you think about something like saving

1302
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,570
into a retirement fund, for example,

1303
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,918
we're doing something that the idea is

1304
00:54:41,944 --> 00:54:44,406
that maybe decades from now is going to

1305
00:54:44,508 --> 00:54:47,666
kind of minor spikes in prediction error

1306
00:54:47,698 --> 00:54:49,766
or the disappointment of not having as

1307
00:54:49,788 --> 00:54:51,414
much money right now is going to pay off

1308
00:54:51,452 --> 00:54:53,898
later. These are the kind of things that

1309
00:54:53,984 --> 00:54:56,342
humans engage in. And our generative

1310
00:54:56,406 --> 00:54:59,786
models have to be temporally thick. So

1311
00:54:59,888 --> 00:55:01,626
George Ben white that the levels of

1312
00:55:01,648 --> 00:55:03,590
temporal extension are hierarchically

1313
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:06,986
interlocked. So shorter scales inform

1314
00:55:07,088 --> 00:55:09,194
expectations of what the agent can do

1315
00:55:09,232 --> 00:55:12,142
over longer scales. So these different

1316
00:55:12,196 --> 00:55:13,966
levels of the hierarchy are in a kind of

1317
00:55:13,988 --> 00:55:16,222
dialogue with each other telling you

1318
00:55:16,276 --> 00:55:17,954
what kinds of things are possible and

1319
00:55:17,992 --> 00:55:20,020
what kinds of things you should expect.

1320
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:23,486
And when we were talking about agency,

1321
00:55:23,598 --> 00:55:26,274
we talked about the way that agency is

1322
00:55:26,312 --> 00:55:28,638
kind of baked into active inference.

1323
00:55:28,814 --> 00:55:30,454
Because in order for any of this to

1324
00:55:30,492 --> 00:55:32,646
work, the system has to have as a

1325
00:55:32,668 --> 00:55:36,360
hypothesis, I can do things okay?

1326
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:40,486
And this is more or less taken to

1327
00:55:40,508 --> 00:55:44,166
be the same thing that underpins

1328
00:55:44,278 --> 00:55:46,086
the sense of self under active

1329
00:55:46,118 --> 00:55:49,158
inference. So the system implicitly

1330
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:51,530
infers its own ability to bring about

1331
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,382
intended sensory consequences. And so

1332
00:55:54,436 --> 00:55:57,086
Dean writes here, quote in Pristine it

1333
00:55:57,108 --> 00:56:00,394
is in this sense that implicit

1334
00:56:00,442 --> 00:56:02,046
in a model of sampling is a

1335
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:05,070
representation or sense of agency.

1336
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,618
So a minimal sense of self,

1337
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:11,186
it's kind of like the flip side of

1338
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:14,930
agency comes baked in here. So one

1339
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,530
has to model oneself as

1340
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,362
a potential cause of sensory inputs.

1341
00:56:21,506 --> 00:56:24,486
So George Dean and colleagues, I think

1342
00:56:24,508 --> 00:56:26,514
George Deane, Mark Miller and Sam

1343
00:56:26,562 --> 00:56:29,782
Wilkinson propose a model of the self

1344
00:56:29,836 --> 00:56:31,266
under active inference called the

1345
00:56:31,308 --> 00:56:32,860
allostatic control model.

1346
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,986
And the move they make here is that we

1347
00:56:37,008 --> 00:56:40,042
have to recognize that it's not just our

1348
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:42,598
self efficacy that has to be modeled.

1349
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:45,418
We also have to have some kind of idea

1350
00:56:45,504 --> 00:56:47,822
in there of how we're actually doing.

1351
00:56:47,876 --> 00:56:50,250
So we have to model our own capabilities

1352
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,366
in order to set precision weighting on

1353
00:56:52,388 --> 00:56:55,514
future action. So we don't simply infer

1354
00:56:55,562 --> 00:56:57,454
that we can be the cause of sensory

1355
00:56:57,502 --> 00:56:59,506
states, but also infer our own

1356
00:56:59,528 --> 00:57:01,650
capabilities to successfully bring about

1357
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,094
expected states at longer timescales.

1358
00:57:04,222 --> 00:57:06,594
So the phrasing that they use is

1359
00:57:06,712 --> 00:57:09,366
tracking the performance or fitness of

1360
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:14,134
the model over time. So part

1361
00:57:14,172 --> 00:57:16,600
of that tracking is going to be

1362
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:19,846
affective and emotional. And so there

1363
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:21,786
are strong links. We're kind of really

1364
00:57:21,808 --> 00:57:23,706
digging our hooks into subjectivity at

1365
00:57:23,728 --> 00:57:24,460
this point.

1366
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:28,726
But the claim with the Allostatic

1367
00:57:28,758 --> 00:57:31,434
Control model is you get this rather

1368
00:57:31,472 --> 00:57:33,370
than just a minimal self, you actually

1369
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,478
get a longer term phenomenological self

1370
00:57:36,564 --> 00:57:38,266
emerge from these interlocking

1371
00:57:38,298 --> 00:57:41,840
timescales, which are modeling not only

1372
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:44,734
the agent's own causal efficacy, but

1373
00:57:44,772 --> 00:57:48,590
also modeling how good your own model is

1374
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:52,242
at doing what you need it to do. And

1375
00:57:52,296 --> 00:57:54,146
like I said, I said when I was talking

1376
00:57:54,168 --> 00:57:55,966
about the reading and I want to flag

1377
00:57:55,998 --> 00:57:59,154
this again because I'm really not doing

1378
00:57:59,192 --> 00:58:01,606
justice to this in the way that I

1379
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:03,826
should. But this has formed the basis

1380
00:58:03,858 --> 00:58:05,686
for a lot of really interesting work on

1381
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:09,606
phenomena like depersonalization on the

1382
00:58:09,628 --> 00:58:11,326
role of psychedelics and the potential

1383
00:58:11,378 --> 00:58:13,962
for psychedelics in therapy and in

1384
00:58:14,016 --> 00:58:17,178
meditation, ego dissolution and kind of

1385
00:58:17,344 --> 00:58:19,558
that kind of stuff in meditative

1386
00:58:19,654 --> 00:58:22,330
settings. So anybody with any interest

1387
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,814
in the self or in those kinds of

1388
00:58:24,852 --> 00:58:27,454
practices should definitely go and give

1389
00:58:27,572 --> 00:58:30,158
a closer look to these readings that

1390
00:58:30,244 --> 00:58:31,870
I'll make sure in a document.

1391
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:37,326
Okay, so quick overview here. So active

1392
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:39,774
inference agents maintain homeostasis

1393
00:58:39,822 --> 00:58:42,114
through anticipatory action, and this is

1394
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:44,020
something we call Allostatic Control.

1395
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,690
To do this, the system must engage in

1396
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,378
interceptive prediction over its own

1397
00:58:49,464 --> 00:58:52,486
internal states. And actually, I think

1398
00:58:52,508 --> 00:58:53,846
I've got time to do this, so I'll just

1399
00:58:53,868 --> 00:58:56,518
deviate slightly. The topic of

1400
00:58:56,604 --> 00:58:59,270
interceptive inference is really

1401
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,898
interesting in the context of active

1402
00:59:00,914 --> 00:59:03,530
inference. So I want to flag work by

1403
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,026
Sarah Garfinkel, who I believe is at

1404
00:59:06,048 --> 00:59:09,180
UCL, who used to be at Sussex. And

1405
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:14,686
Professor Garfinkel's work looks at the

1406
00:59:14,788 --> 00:59:17,914
central importance of interceptive

1407
00:59:17,962 --> 00:59:21,370
predictions in various psychopathologies

1408
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:22,846
especially, I think she's looked very

1409
00:59:22,868 --> 00:59:25,882
closely at PTSD and anxiety disorders.

1410
00:59:26,026 --> 00:59:30,322
And it turns out that an

1411
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:33,646
agent's accuracy in their interoceptive

1412
00:59:33,678 --> 00:59:36,690
predictions is a good indicator as to

1413
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,498
the kinds of symptoms that they're going

1414
00:59:38,504 --> 00:59:40,278
to like, the strength and severity of

1415
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:41,638
their symptoms in these kinds of

1416
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:45,078
disorders. And what she's shown is that

1417
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:48,422
if you can increase the accuracy of

1418
00:59:48,476 --> 00:59:51,606
interceptive predictions, this forms the

1419
00:59:51,628 --> 00:59:54,214
basis of treatment for these symptoms.

1420
00:59:54,262 --> 00:59:57,194
So in short, the better you are at

1421
00:59:57,232 --> 00:59:59,738
interceptive predicting. I think one of

1422
00:59:59,744 --> 01:00:01,546
the measures that they use there in

1423
01:00:01,568 --> 01:00:04,970
herlab is how well people can track

1424
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,938
their own heartbeats without feeling

1425
01:00:06,954 --> 01:00:08,574
their pulse. So if you just sit there

1426
01:00:08,612 --> 01:00:11,786
and try and say like, my heart's

1427
01:00:11,818 --> 01:00:13,102
beating like this, then the more

1428
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:15,822
accurate you are and the more any

1429
01:00:15,876 --> 01:00:17,554
training you can be given to be more

1430
01:00:17,592 --> 01:00:20,130
accurate. It forms the basis of

1431
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,306
effective treatments for these kinds of

1432
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:24,834
symptoms. So I just wanted to flag that

1433
01:00:24,872 --> 01:00:28,354
because the world of research in

1434
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:31,718
enactive inference large,

1435
01:00:31,804 --> 01:00:34,742
diverse, vibrant, super interesting and

1436
01:00:34,796 --> 01:00:38,070
very much worth our time. Okay,

1437
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:41,358
where was I? Here. Okay. So to maintain

1438
01:00:41,394 --> 01:00:43,066
allostatis control, the system has to

1439
01:00:43,088 --> 01:00:44,986
engage in interceptive prediction over

1440
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:48,170
its internal states. And then to best

1441
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,566
explain changes in those internal

1442
01:00:50,598 --> 01:00:53,690
states, the system has to contextualize

1443
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:57,962
those changes against some extraceptive

1444
01:00:58,106 --> 01:01:02,426
input and that emotion categories serve

1445
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,798
that role. So just to be very clear, on

1446
01:01:04,804 --> 01:01:08,050
this view, emotions are constructions.

1447
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:11,106
There are some important deviations from

1448
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:13,140
other theories of emotion here,

1449
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,434
particularly what Barrett calls the

1450
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:19,574
basic theory of emotion. So on her

1451
01:01:19,612 --> 01:01:21,942
view, emotions themselves have no

1452
01:01:21,996 --> 01:01:24,866
underlying kind of essence or neural

1453
01:01:24,898 --> 01:01:28,022
footprint. And there's an ongoing live

1454
01:01:28,076 --> 01:01:29,494
debate there as well between these

1455
01:01:29,532 --> 01:01:30,150
theories.

1456
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,590
And also just at the end,

1457
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,492
the good allostatic control in human

1458
01:01:39,546 --> 01:01:42,420
agents is this very temporally thick

1459
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,964
phenomena. So we engage in very long

1460
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:46,888
term planning that involves a lot of the

1461
01:01:46,894 --> 01:01:49,156
kinds of counterfactual representations

1462
01:01:49,348 --> 01:01:50,916
that we talked about with the Axel

1463
01:01:50,948 --> 01:01:54,004
Constant paper. And this is hypothesized

1464
01:01:54,052 --> 01:01:55,672
to form the basis of our

1465
01:01:55,806 --> 01:02:02,010
phenomenological sense of so,

1466
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,316
okay, we're up to an hour. Good. We're

1467
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:10,320
running on time. This is the final

1468
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:13,328
section and it's probably going to be

1469
01:02:13,414 --> 01:02:14,396
probably going to be the longest

1470
01:02:14,428 --> 01:02:20,576
section. What I want to do here is I

1471
01:02:20,598 --> 01:02:22,048
want to try and pull together some of

1472
01:02:22,054 --> 01:02:23,184
the things I've been talking about

1473
01:02:23,222 --> 01:02:25,312
because it's been very fast and very

1474
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,636
abstract and I want to try and pull some

1475
01:02:27,658 --> 01:02:29,056
of these things together in a slightly

1476
01:02:29,088 --> 01:02:31,124
more concrete example. So the case study

1477
01:02:31,162 --> 01:02:33,444
I'm going to use is addiction. So

1478
01:02:33,482 --> 01:02:34,916
there's a particular account of

1479
01:02:34,938 --> 01:02:36,516
addiction in the predictive process in

1480
01:02:36,538 --> 01:02:38,952
literature that I think in a very

1481
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:42,408
succinct, sharp way highlights a lot

1482
01:02:42,414 --> 01:02:43,832
of the things I've been talking about

1483
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:46,072
and puts them within a context that is

1484
01:02:46,206 --> 01:02:48,490
quite stark and easy to understand.

1485
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,148
But in order to do that, I'm going to

1486
01:02:51,154 --> 01:02:53,630
have to introduce a new,

1487
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,748
slightly more difficult to understand

1488
01:02:56,834 --> 01:02:58,876
mechanism within the framework that

1489
01:02:58,898 --> 01:03:00,476
crops up in a lot of the predictive

1490
01:03:00,508 --> 01:03:02,848
processing literature. And what this is

1491
01:03:02,854 --> 01:03:04,704
going to do, hopefully as well, is give

1492
01:03:04,742 --> 01:03:07,836
us a direct bridge to phenomenology.

1493
01:03:07,948 --> 01:03:10,930
So when we talk about things like

1494
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,760
neurocomputational phenomenology,

1495
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:16,964
the things I'm going to be talking about

1496
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,956
here have underpinned a lot of the work

1497
01:03:19,978 --> 01:03:23,476
in that area. So these are some of the

1498
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:25,204
readings we're going to look at some

1499
01:03:25,242 --> 01:03:28,536
work by mostly a lot of the

1500
01:03:28,558 --> 01:03:30,472
papers. We're going to look at first

1501
01:03:30,526 --> 01:03:32,900
author, Mark Miller, or Mark Miller's

1502
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,096
been second or third author. And I bring

1503
01:03:35,118 --> 01:03:36,612
that up because in the discussion

1504
01:03:36,676 --> 01:03:40,456
section on the 25th, when we have an

1505
01:03:40,478 --> 01:03:42,988
hour to kind of unpack and answer

1506
01:03:43,074 --> 01:03:44,508
people's questions, we're actually going

1507
01:03:44,514 --> 01:03:46,636
to be joined by Mark Miller. So if

1508
01:03:46,658 --> 01:03:48,796
anybody has any specific questions about

1509
01:03:48,818 --> 01:03:50,380
the things I'm going to talk about. Now

1510
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:53,008
in this section, he's going to be the

1511
01:03:53,014 --> 01:03:54,370
man to answer those,

1512
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:57,408
but also I'm going to put a lot of

1513
01:03:57,414 --> 01:03:59,376
secondary readings up again in the

1514
01:03:59,398 --> 01:04:01,296
document so you'd be able to find them

1515
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:04,004
all there. Okay?

1516
01:04:04,122 --> 01:04:07,792
So let's suppose switch gears

1517
01:04:07,856 --> 01:04:11,204
slightly. I want to

1518
01:04:11,242 --> 01:04:14,112
keep the focus on feelings,

1519
01:04:14,256 --> 01:04:15,684
although what I'm going to be talking

1520
01:04:15,722 --> 01:04:18,472
about here are not what might be called

1521
01:04:18,526 --> 01:04:21,416
like full blooded emotion states. But I

1522
01:04:21,438 --> 01:04:22,888
want to talk about something a little

1523
01:04:22,894 --> 01:04:26,152
bit more subtle. So one thing that might

1524
01:04:26,206 --> 01:04:29,516
seem really obvious, kind of so obvious

1525
01:04:29,618 --> 01:04:32,524
that we often overlook it when things

1526
01:04:32,562 --> 01:04:35,368
are going okay, is that it generally

1527
01:04:35,464 --> 01:04:38,892
feels like something to be an agent. So

1528
01:04:38,946 --> 01:04:40,640
when we're going about whatever business

1529
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:44,704
we have in the world, we always

1530
01:04:44,822 --> 01:04:48,032
feel like something, and it's not

1531
01:04:48,086 --> 01:04:50,044
entirely clear how best to characterize

1532
01:04:50,092 --> 01:04:54,032
that. So I want to draw on some work in

1533
01:04:54,086 --> 01:04:56,800
phenomenology that some active inference

1534
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,204
theorists have also drawn on and made

1535
01:04:59,242 --> 01:05:01,412
use of. Because I think this is a really

1536
01:05:01,466 --> 01:05:04,084
good grounding for some of the things

1537
01:05:04,122 --> 01:05:06,372
I'm going to go on to say. Certainly

1538
01:05:06,426 --> 01:05:08,456
proved to be a good grounding for some

1539
01:05:08,478 --> 01:05:10,280
of the work that I'm going to highlight.

1540
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:15,124
So these are two books by Matthew

1541
01:05:15,172 --> 01:05:16,648
Ratcliffe, who I think is at the

1542
01:05:16,654 --> 01:05:20,076
University of York and has done really

1543
01:05:20,178 --> 01:05:23,116
cool work in kind of really getting to

1544
01:05:23,138 --> 01:05:26,270
grips with the what it's likeness to

1545
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,848
live in certain conditions. And

1546
01:05:29,954 --> 01:05:32,476
Ratcliffe, he argues that he's

1547
01:05:32,508 --> 01:05:36,256
identified this certain area, this space

1548
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:38,684
of feelings that have been largely

1549
01:05:38,732 --> 01:05:41,296
neglected in the wider literature, and

1550
01:05:41,318 --> 01:05:43,360
he describes these as existential

1551
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,712
feelings. So he says existential

1552
01:05:47,776 --> 01:05:50,580
feelings are, quote, they are not

1553
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,772
intentional states directed at however

1554
01:05:52,826 --> 01:05:55,552
many objects, and they are not feelings

1555
01:05:55,696 --> 01:05:57,912
of the body or some part of it.

1556
01:05:58,046 --> 01:06:00,264
Instead, they amount to a felt sense of

1557
01:06:00,302 --> 01:06:02,810
belonging in the world. So the main

1558
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,916
difference between a full blooded

1559
01:06:04,948 --> 01:06:07,188
emotion state and an existential feeling

1560
01:06:07,284 --> 01:06:09,708
is that the emotion state is about

1561
01:06:09,794 --> 01:06:13,256
something. Okay? So if I'm disgusted,

1562
01:06:13,368 --> 01:06:16,744
I'm typically all the time I'm disgusted

1563
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:18,796
about something in the world. So

1564
01:06:18,818 --> 01:06:20,930
emotions are intentional in that way.

1565
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:25,612
Radcliffe elaborates on existential

1566
01:06:25,676 --> 01:06:28,096
feelings by I'm going to quote this at

1567
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:30,530
length because I quite like it. He says

1568
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,568
people sometimes talk of feeling alive,

1569
01:06:33,664 --> 01:06:36,816
dead, distant, detached, dislodged,

1570
01:06:36,928 --> 01:06:40,112
estranged, isolated, otherworldly,

1571
01:06:40,256 --> 01:06:42,976
indifferent to everything, overwhelmed,

1572
01:06:43,088 --> 01:06:45,508
suffocated, cut off, lost,

1573
01:06:45,604 --> 01:06:49,668
disconnected, out of sorts, not oneself,

1574
01:06:49,764 --> 01:06:51,912
out of touch with things, out of it,

1575
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,724
not quite with it, separate, in harmony

1576
01:06:54,772 --> 01:06:57,210
with things, at peace with things.

1577
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,276
There are reference to feelings of

1578
01:06:59,298 --> 01:07:01,624
unreality, heightened existence,

1579
01:07:01,752 --> 01:07:04,296
surreality, familiarity,

1580
01:07:04,408 --> 01:07:07,528
unfamiliarity, strangeness, isolation,

1581
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:10,496
emptiness, belonging, being at home in

1582
01:07:10,518 --> 01:07:12,448
the world, being at one with things,

1583
01:07:12,614 --> 01:07:14,896
significance, insignificance, and the

1584
01:07:14,918 --> 01:07:19,936
list goes on. So this

1585
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:22,384
is really cool work, and I recommend

1586
01:07:22,502 --> 01:07:23,836
everybody to go and read Matthew

1587
01:07:23,868 --> 01:07:26,036
Ratcliffe. But some of the work I really

1588
01:07:26,058 --> 01:07:27,856
like in Predictive Processing and Active

1589
01:07:27,888 --> 01:07:30,356
Inference has taken this idea of. An

1590
01:07:30,378 --> 01:07:31,856
existential feeling. And what they've

1591
01:07:31,888 --> 01:07:34,276
recognized is that these kinds of

1592
01:07:34,298 --> 01:07:36,520
feelings are really about how we are

1593
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:39,096
orientated in regards to the world and

1594
01:07:39,118 --> 01:07:41,620
the affordances in it. So they're

1595
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,812
background bodily states of action

1596
01:07:43,876 --> 01:07:47,690
readiness. So how are we relating to

1597
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,956
how do we find ourselves in relation to

1598
01:07:50,978 --> 01:07:53,164
the world? So we're talking about the

1599
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:55,404
general structuring that's present in

1600
01:07:55,442 --> 01:07:58,076
our everyday phenomenology. So I really

1601
01:07:58,098 --> 01:07:59,864
want to make that clear that what this

1602
01:07:59,922 --> 01:08:02,012
work is doing is building a bridge

1603
01:08:02,076 --> 01:08:05,232
between computational models and

1604
01:08:05,286 --> 01:08:07,264
the way even the underpinnings of those

1605
01:08:07,302 --> 01:08:09,392
models in neurobiology and

1606
01:08:09,446 --> 01:08:10,930
phenomenological experience.

1607
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,652
So the thing that I need to introduce,

1608
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,544
and this can be, it's fairly

1609
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,860
straightforward, but it can be a little

1610
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:20,016
bit tricky at times, is this notion

1611
01:08:20,048 --> 01:08:22,404
error dynamics. This is really

1612
01:08:22,442 --> 01:08:24,516
important. So like I just said,

1613
01:08:24,538 --> 01:08:26,376
aerodynamics is going to provide this

1614
01:08:26,398 --> 01:08:27,944
conceptual bridge between different

1615
01:08:27,982 --> 01:08:31,800
levels of analysis and it elaborates on

1616
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:34,728
how systems are sensitive to the success

1617
01:08:34,894 --> 01:08:37,880
or failure of their own action policies

1618
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,424
unfolding across multiple timescales.

1619
01:08:40,552 --> 01:08:43,116
So the recognition here is that we talk

1620
01:08:43,138 --> 01:08:46,024
a lot about action policies and expected

1621
01:08:46,072 --> 01:08:48,828
states, but the reality is that we have

1622
01:08:48,994 --> 01:08:52,764
a multitude of goals and action policies

1623
01:08:52,812 --> 01:08:54,784
and expected states that are

1624
01:08:54,822 --> 01:08:57,244
interlocking, overlapping, constantly

1625
01:08:57,292 --> 01:09:00,816
shifting. The picture is messy. And so I

1626
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:04,276
like this quote from the 2019 paper

1627
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:06,804
that says the roller coaster of

1628
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:08,964
continual increases and decreases of

1629
01:09:09,002 --> 01:09:10,788
errors that accompany life become

1630
01:09:10,874 --> 01:09:13,364
expected and are folded into our

1631
01:09:13,402 --> 01:09:15,816
expectations. For such a system it

1632
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:17,864
becomes important not only to track the

1633
01:09:17,902 --> 01:09:20,132
constantly fluctuating instantaneous

1634
01:09:20,196 --> 01:09:22,824
errors, but also to pay attention to the

1635
01:09:22,862 --> 01:09:25,160
dynamics of error reduction over longer

1636
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:28,856
timescales. So the systems, the upshot

1637
01:09:28,888 --> 01:09:30,940
of this is that these authors believe,

1638
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:33,196
building on some other work in

1639
01:09:33,218 --> 01:09:35,512
computational modeling, that systems

1640
01:09:35,576 --> 01:09:38,744
must track the rate of change in overall

1641
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:41,404
error reduction relative to the system's

1642
01:09:41,452 --> 01:09:45,216
expectations. So this is the kind of

1643
01:09:45,318 --> 01:09:48,656
global upwards or downwards trend in

1644
01:09:48,678 --> 01:09:50,912
prediction error. That's what the system

1645
01:09:50,966 --> 01:09:53,956
is sensitive to, how that relates to the

1646
01:09:53,978 --> 01:09:54,980
expectations.

1647
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:00,688
So the idea here is that aerodynamics

1648
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:03,440
provide a system with a much broader

1649
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,344
ongoing sense of how they're doing to

1650
01:10:06,382 --> 01:10:09,544
their multitude of goals over time.

1651
01:10:09,742 --> 01:10:13,336
So a big step here is that

1652
01:10:13,438 --> 01:10:15,572
those changes in the rate of reduction

1653
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:18,056
feed back into the system. So they're

1654
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,924
folded back within the system and they

1655
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:23,176
serve the role of modulating precision

1656
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,460
on action policies. So let's say I'm

1657
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,388
engaged in some task. I have a

1658
01:10:29,394 --> 01:10:31,468
particular expectation about how I'm

1659
01:10:31,484 --> 01:10:33,696
going to do at that task. And when I

1660
01:10:33,718 --> 01:10:35,264
actually engage with the task, I do

1661
01:10:35,302 --> 01:10:38,992
slightly worse than expected. The idea

1662
01:10:39,046 --> 01:10:42,208
there is that that rate of change,

1663
01:10:42,294 --> 01:10:45,076
so the rate of error reduction is going

1664
01:10:45,098 --> 01:10:47,872
to decrease until I'm reducing error

1665
01:10:47,936 --> 01:10:50,516
worse than my expectations. And in a

1666
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,388
typical healthily functioning system,

1667
01:10:52,474 --> 01:10:54,596
that rate of change, the sensitivity to

1668
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:56,016
that rate of change is going to feed

1669
01:10:56,048 --> 01:10:58,548
back and reset the precision weighting

1670
01:10:58,564 --> 01:11:00,410
on those actions. So it's going to

1671
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:03,768
reduce my confidence in that particular

1672
01:11:03,854 --> 01:11:06,168
action policy such that I might try a

1673
01:11:06,174 --> 01:11:07,816
different strategy, I might try a

1674
01:11:07,838 --> 01:11:11,144
different tactic, or I might just throw

1675
01:11:11,192 --> 01:11:12,956
whatever it is that I'm doing away and

1676
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:15,256
go and do something else. So we're

1677
01:11:15,288 --> 01:11:17,292
starting to see this picture of through

1678
01:11:17,426 --> 01:11:21,260
expectations, sensitivity to change and

1679
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:24,076
feedback onto precision waiting. It's

1680
01:11:24,108 --> 01:11:27,984
starting to dictate how I manage my

1681
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:30,636
action policies. So there's this ongoing

1682
01:11:30,668 --> 01:11:32,508
reciprocal relationship between

1683
01:11:32,614 --> 01:11:35,300
aerodynamics and my future expectations.

1684
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,404
Now, crucially, the claim here is that

1685
01:11:38,442 --> 01:11:41,332
on the subject level, all of this

1686
01:11:41,386 --> 01:11:44,096
manifests as these existential feelings

1687
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:47,496
of some kind. So the way that I feel on

1688
01:11:47,518 --> 01:11:49,576
a kind of day to day basis is a

1689
01:11:49,598 --> 01:11:52,776
reflection of how I'm doing in terms of

1690
01:11:52,798 --> 01:11:55,624
these sensitivity to aerodynamics. So

1691
01:11:55,662 --> 01:11:59,256
when I fail at the task and precision

1692
01:11:59,288 --> 01:12:01,004
weighting is down regulated on that

1693
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:03,532
particular action policy, the thing that

1694
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:06,684
actually kind of oomph that moves me

1695
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:08,860
to go and do something else are my

1696
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:11,184
embodied feelings of frustration that I

1697
01:12:11,222 --> 01:12:14,016
experience. So as conscious agents,

1698
01:12:14,118 --> 01:12:16,752
those embodied feelings are what are

1699
01:12:16,806 --> 01:12:18,704
tuning us towards acting more

1700
01:12:18,742 --> 01:12:22,428
effectively. So optimal behavior

1701
01:12:22,524 --> 01:12:25,124
on this account is characterized as a

1702
01:12:25,322 --> 01:12:27,924
feeling of grip towards a shifting field

1703
01:12:27,962 --> 01:12:29,776
of affordances. So I'm going to unpack

1704
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:32,276
this quickly. But the feeling of grip in

1705
01:12:32,298 --> 01:12:34,164
a nutshell is just this feeling that

1706
01:12:34,202 --> 01:12:37,496
we're engaging with our affordances in

1707
01:12:37,518 --> 01:12:39,524
the best way that we can and that we're

1708
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:41,752
either meeting or exceeding our

1709
01:12:41,806 --> 01:12:44,196
expectations for prediction, error,

1710
01:12:44,228 --> 01:12:46,664
minimization what they mean by a field

1711
01:12:46,702 --> 01:12:49,692
of affordances. And this is again really

1712
01:12:49,746 --> 01:12:53,244
important. A landscape of affordances is

1713
01:12:53,282 --> 01:12:55,036
just the total opportunities in my

1714
01:12:55,058 --> 01:12:57,624
niche. So my landscape of affordances

1715
01:12:57,672 --> 01:13:00,572
right now is Brighton. It's not really

1716
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,128
going to change very quickly unless I

1717
01:13:02,134 --> 01:13:04,050
get on a plane and fly somewhere else.

1718
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,936
But affordances aren't neutral in that

1719
01:13:07,958 --> 01:13:10,370
way. They don't just exist there.

1720
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:13,744
The affordances that stand out to me as

1721
01:13:13,782 --> 01:13:16,756
relevant or attractive is going to

1722
01:13:16,778 --> 01:13:18,836
change quite rapidly depending on what

1723
01:13:18,858 --> 01:13:20,788
it is I'm doing, on my internal state,

1724
01:13:20,874 --> 01:13:23,908
on the context and so on. So right now

1725
01:13:23,994 --> 01:13:25,924
my water bottle stands out as

1726
01:13:25,962 --> 01:13:27,908
attractive, a couple of keys on my

1727
01:13:27,914 --> 01:13:29,976
keyboard stand out as attractive. But

1728
01:13:29,998 --> 01:13:31,784
that's going to shift quite rapidly once

1729
01:13:31,822 --> 01:13:33,496
this lecture is over and I turn to do

1730
01:13:33,518 --> 01:13:36,264
something else. So the idea of grip is

1731
01:13:36,302 --> 01:13:39,836
that we exhibit a stability in

1732
01:13:39,858 --> 01:13:43,112
our attunement such that we can remain

1733
01:13:43,176 --> 01:13:47,052
attuned as that field changes. And this

1734
01:13:47,106 --> 01:13:49,400
is part of the skilled intentionality

1735
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,536
framework which I won't get into because

1736
01:13:51,558 --> 01:13:53,856
I don't want theoretical overload, but

1737
01:13:53,878 --> 01:13:56,496
I've put some papers up on this slide as

1738
01:13:56,518 --> 01:13:58,556
references and of course the reading

1739
01:13:58,588 --> 01:14:01,676
will be in the document. But skilled

1740
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:04,144
intentionality refers to the enactive,

1741
01:14:04,192 --> 01:14:06,944
openness and responsiveness to multiple

1742
01:14:06,992 --> 01:14:08,976
relevant affordances in a concrete

1743
01:14:09,008 --> 01:14:11,504
situation. So it's just this recognition

1744
01:14:11,552 --> 01:14:14,956
that things change quickly for multiple

1745
01:14:15,008 --> 01:14:17,336
reasons and we really need to exhibit a

1746
01:14:17,358 --> 01:14:19,384
kind of flexibility and stability in

1747
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:23,556
those engagements. And aerodynamics

1748
01:14:23,748 --> 01:14:26,264
has been applied in lots of very, very

1749
01:14:26,302 --> 01:14:28,836
cool ways. I can't recommend this work

1750
01:14:28,878 --> 01:14:32,184
highly enough. So aerodynamics, I won't

1751
01:14:32,232 --> 01:14:34,636
run through how everything has been

1752
01:14:34,658 --> 01:14:37,804
explained just for time reasons, but you

1753
01:14:37,842 --> 01:14:38,924
can kind of take a look at this

1754
01:14:38,962 --> 01:14:40,888
yourself. But aerodynamics has been

1755
01:14:40,914 --> 01:14:44,016
proposed as a more complete answer to

1756
01:14:44,038 --> 01:14:45,536
the dark room problem that we were

1757
01:14:45,558 --> 01:14:47,504
talking about earlier, because it can

1758
01:14:47,542 --> 01:14:50,304
explain the drive for exploration and

1759
01:14:50,342 --> 01:14:52,944
curiosity, because it literally feels

1760
01:14:52,992 --> 01:14:55,152
good to minimize prediction errors

1761
01:14:55,216 --> 01:14:57,604
better than expected. So again, that

1762
01:14:57,642 --> 01:14:59,744
rate of change manifests as embodied

1763
01:14:59,792 --> 01:15:02,964
feeling. So we're always looking for

1764
01:15:03,002 --> 01:15:04,644
opportunities to do better than

1765
01:15:04,682 --> 01:15:06,984
expected. And kind of this has been

1766
01:15:07,022 --> 01:15:08,616
suggested to account for feelings of

1767
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:11,464
boredom, prompting us to go out and find

1768
01:15:11,502 --> 01:15:13,812
new things to do. And similarly,

1769
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:16,152
aerodynamics has provided a

1770
01:15:16,206 --> 01:15:19,544
computational account of play, which for

1771
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:21,656
a while has remained a kind of mystery

1772
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:23,404
because it's on the face of it like,

1773
01:15:23,442 --> 01:15:25,368
why would we engage in play when it's

1774
01:15:25,384 --> 01:15:28,012
metabolically costly and we need that

1775
01:15:28,066 --> 01:15:30,136
energy for other things? Like Lisa

1776
01:15:30,168 --> 01:15:32,544
Feldman, barrett says managing energy is

1777
01:15:32,582 --> 01:15:35,932
super important. So why do baby animals

1778
01:15:36,076 --> 01:15:38,684
burn? It all engaging in playful

1779
01:15:38,732 --> 01:15:42,176
behavior. Aerodynamics has a story for

1780
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:44,480
us there. And there are also

1781
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:47,100
aerodynamics based accounts of happiness

1782
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:50,388
and wellbeing and depression as well.

1783
01:15:50,474 --> 01:15:52,132
So I won't go into the details there.

1784
01:15:52,186 --> 01:15:54,388
But it turns out that aerodynamics and

1785
01:15:54,394 --> 01:15:56,792
this connection to phenomenology is this

1786
01:15:56,846 --> 01:16:00,200
super malleable, flexible kind of

1787
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:02,552
feature of the framework that really

1788
01:16:02,606 --> 01:16:05,432
underpins a lot of what we experience

1789
01:16:05,566 --> 01:16:08,110
and do as active inference agents.

1790
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,430
Okay,

1791
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:15,834
so I'm going to talk a little bit about

1792
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:19,514
addiction. Got some time

1793
01:16:19,552 --> 01:16:20,860
here. Things are going well,

1794
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:26,654
so I take so

1795
01:16:26,692 --> 01:16:28,126
I had some options here because I wanted

1796
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:30,874
to use a case study that really brought

1797
01:16:30,922 --> 01:16:32,814
out some of the things I was talking

1798
01:16:32,852 --> 01:16:34,674
about. And as I've just said,

1799
01:16:34,712 --> 01:16:36,558
aerodynamics has been applied in a bunch

1800
01:16:36,574 --> 01:16:39,474
of different areas and it's all very

1801
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,214
much worth talking about. But I chose

1802
01:16:41,262 --> 01:16:42,420
addiction because,

1803
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:46,354
well, as you'll see, as I kind of make

1804
01:16:46,392 --> 01:16:48,854
clear, I think it also brings out not

1805
01:16:48,892 --> 01:16:50,466
just the way that all of this fits

1806
01:16:50,498 --> 01:16:53,750
together, but also why it's good and why

1807
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:57,190
seeing people as active inference agents

1808
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:00,166
and broader structures as active

1809
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:03,386
inference structures is actually a

1810
01:17:03,408 --> 01:17:07,174
worthwhile thing to do. So addiction

1811
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:10,186
was once viewed as a moral failing. So

1812
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:13,214
the kind of Victorian addict is too

1813
01:17:13,252 --> 01:17:14,894
rotten to make the right choice, too

1814
01:17:14,932 --> 01:17:18,746
self indulgent. I say Victorian unless

1815
01:17:18,778 --> 01:17:20,574
you're Peter Hitchens and then you still

1816
01:17:20,612 --> 01:17:23,726
subscribe to this view. But that's the

1817
01:17:23,748 --> 01:17:25,422
old fashioned view. There was something

1818
01:17:25,476 --> 01:17:27,106
wrong with the addict, some moral or

1819
01:17:27,128 --> 01:17:29,362
spiritual failing, and gradually that

1820
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:31,074
changed to what the dominant view is

1821
01:17:31,112 --> 01:17:33,986
today, which is the disease model. And

1822
01:17:34,008 --> 01:17:35,666
the idea here is that addiction is a

1823
01:17:35,688 --> 01:17:37,734
disease and that disease is

1824
01:17:37,772 --> 01:17:41,350
characterized by changes in the brain,

1825
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:44,450
which changes to brain structures,

1826
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:48,102
which mean the addict can't help but

1827
01:17:48,156 --> 01:17:50,326
act in a certain way when confronted

1828
01:17:50,358 --> 01:17:52,490
with a certain stimulus. So it's this

1829
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,446
loss of control that's engendered

1830
01:17:55,478 --> 01:17:58,554
through these brain structures. And this

1831
01:17:58,592 --> 01:18:00,650
is the idea of it being a disease.

1832
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:05,120
The work that I'm going to describe now,

1833
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:07,294
I won't go into too much detail here,

1834
01:18:07,332 --> 01:18:09,982
but it's kind of founded on this thought

1835
01:18:10,036 --> 01:18:13,954
that this disease model, it can't be

1836
01:18:13,992 --> 01:18:16,818
quite right because these changes in

1837
01:18:16,824 --> 01:18:19,186
brain structure, essentially that's what

1838
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:21,906
the brain does. It's just learning.

1839
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:23,794
This is what we do all the time.

1840
01:18:23,912 --> 01:18:26,966
Essentially, me completing my PhD is a

1841
01:18:26,988 --> 01:18:29,126
process of me undergoing changes to my

1842
01:18:29,148 --> 01:18:32,680
brain such that I'm kind of

1843
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:36,440
disposed to act in certain ways.

1844
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,622
I think it's mark Lewis in his book 2018

1845
01:18:41,686 --> 01:18:44,982
The Biology of Desire, argues,

1846
01:18:45,126 --> 01:18:47,034
look, addiction is more of just a

1847
01:18:47,072 --> 01:18:49,114
dysfunction in learning. It's not really

1848
01:18:49,152 --> 01:18:52,320
a disease. So we need to think about it

1849
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:55,758
a little bit differently. And this work

1850
01:18:55,844 --> 01:18:58,080
by Miller and colleagues, 2020,

1851
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:02,014
that's where it picks up. Okay? So the

1852
01:19:02,052 --> 01:19:04,640
idea is that those brain changes

1853
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,970
engendered through exposure to a

1854
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,386
stimulus. In this case we're going to

1855
01:19:08,408 --> 01:19:10,434
talk about a drug. We're going to leave

1856
01:19:10,472 --> 01:19:12,420
behavioral addiction aside for a second

1857
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:15,362
that clearly plays a critical role. So

1858
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:18,998
nobody's going to deny the kind

1859
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:22,086
of chemical, the importance of the

1860
01:19:22,108 --> 01:19:24,358
biology here that's going on in the

1861
01:19:24,364 --> 01:19:26,066
brain. And of course, different drugs

1862
01:19:26,098 --> 01:19:27,718
have different chemical profiles in that

1863
01:19:27,724 --> 01:19:30,454
regard. But on this view we're going to

1864
01:19:30,492 --> 01:19:32,730
kind of shift focus from that slightly

1865
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:34,794
and we're going to have a much more

1866
01:19:34,832 --> 01:19:37,366
active picture where we view addiction

1867
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:39,466
as a self organizing process of whole

1868
01:19:39,568 --> 01:19:43,246
agent environment systems. Okay, so I

1869
01:19:43,268 --> 01:19:45,246
have this extract here it is in the

1870
01:19:45,268 --> 01:19:47,710
dynamic interaction between the agent

1871
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,726
and its environment that addiction is

1872
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:52,446
born and endures. So the harm of

1873
01:19:52,468 --> 01:19:54,578
addiction emerges from a breakdown in

1874
01:19:54,584 --> 01:19:56,674
the broader stable dynamics that

1875
01:19:56,712 --> 01:19:59,586
typically underpin a flourishing life

1876
01:19:59,688 --> 01:20:01,906
work, family, friends, health, and so

1877
01:20:01,928 --> 01:20:05,554
on. So a typically flourishing life has

1878
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:08,774
a broad kind of bush of concerns over

1879
01:20:08,812 --> 01:20:11,090
different timescales in different areas.

1880
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,206
And what we're going to see is that the

1881
01:20:13,228 --> 01:20:15,302
harm of addiction is in a narrowing of

1882
01:20:15,356 --> 01:20:16,630
those concerns.

1883
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:22,954
So what happens is when somebody takes

1884
01:20:22,992 --> 01:20:26,186
a drug to some people who are exposed to

1885
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:29,578
drugs, that drug is going to, through

1886
01:20:29,664 --> 01:20:33,110
direct action on some neural mechanisms,

1887
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:34,766
is going to signal to the agent that

1888
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,846
they've done better than expected at

1889
01:20:36,868 --> 01:20:38,254
reducing prediction error. Of course

1890
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:40,414
this is a losery. They haven't really

1891
01:20:40,452 --> 01:20:42,094
done better than expected in anything

1892
01:20:42,132 --> 01:20:44,322
that matters. But the signal they get

1893
01:20:44,376 --> 01:20:46,334
is, wow, like we have just reduced

1894
01:20:46,382 --> 01:20:49,794
prediction error at this insane rate and

1895
01:20:49,912 --> 01:20:53,470
repeated use through this aerodynamics

1896
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:56,126
mechanism, repeated use is going to tune

1897
01:20:56,158 --> 01:20:58,322
our expectations about the kinds of

1898
01:20:58,376 --> 01:21:00,646
prediction error slopes, the kind of

1899
01:21:00,748 --> 01:21:02,406
slopes of prediction error that are

1900
01:21:02,428 --> 01:21:04,566
available to us in the environment. And

1901
01:21:04,588 --> 01:21:06,214
we're going to start to expect those

1902
01:21:06,252 --> 01:21:08,434
vertiginous slopes of error reduction if

1903
01:21:08,492 --> 01:21:11,830
we continue to engage with the drug.

1904
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:14,090
And once those expectations become

1905
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,994
deeply ingrained, anything else we do is

1906
01:21:18,032 --> 01:21:20,086
going to start to feel like failure.

1907
01:21:20,198 --> 01:21:23,766
Okay? So if I get used to taking cocaine

1908
01:21:23,798 --> 01:21:26,094
all the time and then I have to sit

1909
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:27,886
through a family meal where I don't have

1910
01:21:27,908 --> 01:21:30,622
any drugs and I have to kind of sit

1911
01:21:30,676 --> 01:21:33,358
still and there's no dopamine available,

1912
01:21:33,444 --> 01:21:36,146
I don't have my phone. I'm going to

1913
01:21:36,168 --> 01:21:37,634
experience that as feelings of

1914
01:21:37,672 --> 01:21:40,594
frustration and as if I'm being

1915
01:21:40,632 --> 01:21:42,338
prevented from doing something I want to

1916
01:21:42,344 --> 01:21:45,122
do. And I'm going to experience that as

1917
01:21:45,176 --> 01:21:47,422
doing worse than expected. So I've

1918
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,850
learnt these expectations for prediction

1919
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:52,022
error minimization and I'm not getting

1920
01:21:52,076 --> 01:21:54,374
them unless I engage with the drug. And

1921
01:21:54,412 --> 01:21:55,974
of course it's worth noting that in many

1922
01:21:56,012 --> 01:21:57,862
cases these drugs are going to have

1923
01:21:57,996 --> 01:21:59,814
chemical withdrawal effects that

1924
01:21:59,852 --> 01:22:01,754
compound that as well, especially things

1925
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,962
like nicotine. And alcohol in particular

1926
01:22:04,016 --> 01:22:06,620
is very nasty. So alcohol can kill you

1927
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:08,714
if you try and withdraw from it too

1928
01:22:08,752 --> 01:22:11,466
quickly. So they really do pull the

1929
01:22:11,488 --> 01:22:14,286
agent into a grip. So what happens here

1930
01:22:14,308 --> 01:22:15,694
is the agent develops a kind of

1931
01:22:15,732 --> 01:22:19,770
suboptimal grip. So you start to enact

1932
01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:22,894
a new world, a new identity. So instead

1933
01:22:22,932 --> 01:22:24,630
of doing all the things you once cared

1934
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:26,786
about, like different hobbies, you start

1935
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:28,546
to hang out with different people, you

1936
01:22:28,568 --> 01:22:30,786
start to frequent different places like

1937
01:22:30,888 --> 01:22:33,714
a dealer's house or wherever, and very

1938
01:22:33,752 --> 01:22:36,690
slowly you start to carve out

1939
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,766
essentially a niche. The addict enacts a

1940
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,730
particular niche through their actions

1941
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:45,062
and they have quite a good grip on that

1942
01:22:45,116 --> 01:22:47,622
niche. It's just that it doesn't speak

1943
01:22:47,676 --> 01:22:50,090
to a broader array of concerns.

1944
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:54,250
So what's really important

1945
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,802
is that this pushes back against

1946
01:22:57,856 --> 01:22:59,802
the disease model because on this view,

1947
01:22:59,936 --> 01:23:02,554
the active inference agent, well, the

1948
01:23:02,592 --> 01:23:05,278
system is doing essentially what it was

1949
01:23:05,364 --> 01:23:08,462
evolved to do. So there's another

1950
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:10,142
quote from the paper here that I like

1951
01:23:10,196 --> 01:23:12,574
that says their habits allow them to

1952
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:15,486
remain well attuned and keep prediction

1953
01:23:15,518 --> 01:23:18,226
errors under tight control so long as

1954
01:23:18,248 --> 01:23:20,142
they remain within the narrow confines

1955
01:23:20,206 --> 01:23:23,746
of such a that. And this is

1956
01:23:23,768 --> 01:23:25,218
important because it shows that

1957
01:23:25,304 --> 01:23:27,826
allostatic control and prediction error

1958
01:23:27,858 --> 01:23:30,342
minimization are not the same thing.

1959
01:23:30,396 --> 01:23:32,338
They come apart. And this really speaks

1960
01:23:32,354 --> 01:23:34,022
to a question that was asked after

1961
01:23:34,076 --> 01:23:37,974
Avel's session recently about what does

1962
01:23:38,012 --> 01:23:39,626
prediction error actually look like?

1963
01:23:39,728 --> 01:23:42,842
Well, in this case you have a system

1964
01:23:42,896 --> 01:23:45,674
that has learned that engagement with

1965
01:23:45,712 --> 01:23:48,986
certain affordances gives it's an

1966
01:23:49,008 --> 01:23:51,434
illusion, but it has this feedback that

1967
01:23:51,472 --> 01:23:54,686
says this is the state you expect to

1968
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:57,294
occupy, or this is the state that the

1969
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:59,866
agent has learned to expect to occupy.

1970
01:23:59,978 --> 01:24:02,174
And it's carved out a niche of

1971
01:24:02,212 --> 01:24:05,006
affordances that means it's very likely

1972
01:24:05,038 --> 01:24:07,234
to occupy that state. So it actually has

1973
01:24:07,272 --> 01:24:08,900
a really good grip on the situation.

1974
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:12,706
It's just that that niche is

1975
01:24:12,728 --> 01:24:15,086
very narrow and it's constricted,

1976
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:21,222
meaning it's simply those

1977
01:24:21,276 --> 01:24:23,746
habits and that web of habitual action

1978
01:24:23,778 --> 01:24:27,334
policies are just not well suited to

1979
01:24:27,372 --> 01:24:29,900
maintain good allostatic control.

1980
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:35,624
So everything else in the addict's life

1981
01:24:35,742 --> 01:24:38,808
starts to suffer. So we can kind of

1982
01:24:38,814 --> 01:24:40,916
think of this as a form of niche

1983
01:24:40,948 --> 01:24:43,128
construction gone wrong. And I think

1984
01:24:43,134 --> 01:24:43,956
we're going to look at niche

1985
01:24:43,988 --> 01:24:45,756
construction in the coming weeks as

1986
01:24:45,778 --> 01:24:49,500
well. So why is this whole agent

1987
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:51,308
well, so I should say just to back up a

1988
01:24:51,314 --> 01:24:53,804
second. So what I like about this

1989
01:24:53,842 --> 01:24:55,084
account of addiction is that it's

1990
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:56,736
thoroughly an enactive account of

1991
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,216
addiction. It really brings out the kind

1992
01:24:59,238 --> 01:25:01,916
of inactive core of active inference.

1993
01:25:02,028 --> 01:25:05,164
So the addict is addiction becomes

1994
01:25:05,212 --> 01:25:08,276
an identity. It becomes a world that the

1995
01:25:08,298 --> 01:25:10,404
person actually produces through their

1996
01:25:10,442 --> 01:25:12,544
actions. So rather than the disease

1997
01:25:12,592 --> 01:25:15,076
model where you have a person and a

1998
01:25:15,098 --> 01:25:18,256
stimulus and exposure, whenever they're

1999
01:25:18,288 --> 01:25:19,828
exposed to that stimulus, they're going

2000
01:25:19,834 --> 01:25:21,508
to have problems because of these brain

2001
01:25:21,604 --> 01:25:24,072
changes. What this does justice to is

2002
01:25:24,126 --> 01:25:26,584
actually the activity of the agent. So

2003
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:28,376
they're not accidentally bumping into

2004
01:25:28,398 --> 01:25:30,968
this stimulus in the environment and

2005
01:25:30,974 --> 01:25:33,084
they're not just seeking it out, but

2006
01:25:33,122 --> 01:25:35,004
they're deliberately restructuring their

2007
01:25:35,042 --> 01:25:37,724
environment to make this state more and

2008
01:25:37,762 --> 01:25:41,004
more likely over time. So it really does

2009
01:25:41,122 --> 01:25:44,660
justice to the efficacy and the agency

2010
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:48,656
of the agent rather than giving that

2011
01:25:48,678 --> 01:25:51,376
agency a more backseat role that it

2012
01:25:51,398 --> 01:25:53,456
takes in the disease model. But the

2013
01:25:53,478 --> 01:25:55,596
other thing that it does, because it's

2014
01:25:55,628 --> 01:25:58,772
this inactive picture, is that it also

2015
01:25:58,826 --> 01:26:00,464
does justice to the environmental

2016
01:26:00,512 --> 01:26:04,084
features. So it

2017
01:26:04,122 --> 01:26:05,700
kind of speaks to the fact that

2018
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:08,228
addiction is not just all in the head.

2019
01:26:08,394 --> 01:26:12,088
Actually, some of the problems

2020
01:26:12,174 --> 01:26:13,976
of addiction come with the fact that it

2021
01:26:13,998 --> 01:26:16,772
is this procedural,

2022
01:26:16,836 --> 01:26:19,704
constructive process. And one of my

2023
01:26:19,742 --> 01:26:22,408
favorite experiments of all time is I

2024
01:26:22,414 --> 01:26:23,528
don't know if people are familiar with

2025
01:26:23,534 --> 01:26:25,676
the Rat City experiments. This is why

2026
01:26:25,698 --> 01:26:28,396
I've got the image up here. And this was

2027
01:26:28,418 --> 01:26:31,224
a very cool experiment where originally

2028
01:26:31,272 --> 01:26:33,884
it was found that if you exposed rats to

2029
01:26:34,002 --> 01:26:36,416
a drug laced stimulus in the

2030
01:26:36,438 --> 01:26:40,556
environment, I think it was heroin

2031
01:26:40,588 --> 01:26:42,096
laced water or it might have been

2032
01:26:42,118 --> 01:26:44,364
cocaine. But the original experiments

2033
01:26:44,412 --> 01:26:46,496
found that nearly all the rats would

2034
01:26:46,518 --> 01:26:48,116
kill themselves with the drug, so they

2035
01:26:48,138 --> 01:26:52,772
would just keep at the drug until

2036
01:26:52,826 --> 01:26:55,764
they died. And it was a very high

2037
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:57,716
percentage of the rats would engage in

2038
01:26:57,738 --> 01:27:00,276
that destructive behavior until the

2039
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:04,072
experiments were rerun sometime later.

2040
01:27:04,206 --> 01:27:06,056
And instead of having the rat just in a

2041
01:27:06,078 --> 01:27:08,580
boring cage on its own, it had the rats

2042
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:12,008
in Rat Park, which was a very social,

2043
01:27:12,174 --> 01:27:14,336
exciting, brightly colored environment

2044
01:27:14,388 --> 01:27:16,924
with lots of different affordances. And

2045
01:27:16,962 --> 01:27:19,052
what they found was that given the same

2046
01:27:19,106 --> 01:27:21,628
choice, a vastly reduced proportion of

2047
01:27:21,634 --> 01:27:23,548
the rats would choose to engage with the

2048
01:27:23,554 --> 01:27:26,896
drug. Okay, so it's capturing the

2049
01:27:26,918 --> 01:27:30,208
importance of niche construction that I

2050
01:27:30,214 --> 01:27:32,448
think is really nice here. And it also

2051
01:27:32,534 --> 01:27:35,724
speaks to the role played by embodied

2052
01:27:35,772 --> 01:27:38,416
affect in phenomenology. There's

2053
01:27:38,448 --> 01:27:40,752
something that it's like to be an addict

2054
01:27:40,896 --> 01:27:43,412
and that really matters. It really

2055
01:27:43,466 --> 01:27:45,044
matters that the addict has these

2056
01:27:45,082 --> 01:27:48,496
embodied experiences when they're

2057
01:27:48,528 --> 01:27:50,216
engaging with particular sets of

2058
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:51,240
affordances.

2059
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,936
So that's really summed up in the

2060
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:56,856
overview that I've put here. So these

2061
01:27:56,878 --> 01:27:58,056
were the things that I wanted to

2062
01:27:58,078 --> 01:28:01,908
emphasize. Active inference agents are

2063
01:28:02,014 --> 01:28:03,788
embodied. They're embedded in a

2064
01:28:03,794 --> 01:28:07,064
landscape. That landscape is constituted

2065
01:28:07,112 --> 01:28:09,564
by particular affordances. And we can

2066
01:28:09,602 --> 01:28:11,996
distinguish between a landscape of

2067
01:28:12,018 --> 01:28:14,152
affordances and a field of affordances.

2068
01:28:14,216 --> 01:28:16,272
And that distinction really speaks to

2069
01:28:16,326 --> 01:28:19,516
the inherent affectivity and normativity

2070
01:28:19,548 --> 01:28:22,592
of affordances, which affordances stand

2071
01:28:22,646 --> 01:28:24,912
out to us at a particular time, which

2072
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:27,936
exert a pull over us and enactive

2073
01:28:27,968 --> 01:28:30,096
inference. Agents enact their worlds

2074
01:28:30,128 --> 01:28:32,064
through action. And this is nowhere

2075
01:28:32,112 --> 01:28:34,100
starker than in the case of addiction.

2076
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:38,400
Active inference agents are effective.

2077
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,532
So emotion plays this super crucial

2078
01:28:40,596 --> 01:28:44,056
role, keeping us tuned, keeping us

2079
01:28:44,078 --> 01:28:47,432
in that grip with our affordances, and

2080
01:28:47,486 --> 01:28:49,320
helping us contextualize those important

2081
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:52,824
physiological changes. Active inference

2082
01:28:52,872 --> 01:28:56,252
agents are agents, okay? So we do have

2083
01:28:56,306 --> 01:29:00,184
a way to describe behavior as agential

2084
01:29:00,232 --> 01:29:02,492
and motivated, and we do have these

2085
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:04,364
cognitive architectures that can make

2086
01:29:04,402 --> 01:29:07,836
sense of agential action. And active

2087
01:29:07,868 --> 01:29:10,672
inference agents have this inbuilt sense

2088
01:29:10,726 --> 01:29:13,330
of self that comes with agency as well.

2089
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:17,520
So that's pretty much it. This final

2090
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:19,604
slide just goes over some of the things

2091
01:29:19,642 --> 01:29:22,276
that we can expect. So what I've done

2092
01:29:22,298 --> 01:29:24,564
today, I hope, has laid a good

2093
01:29:24,602 --> 01:29:26,692
groundwork and has installed some higher

2094
01:29:26,746 --> 01:29:29,172
level expectations to learn more about

2095
01:29:29,226 --> 01:29:31,588
active inference. And what we're going

2096
01:29:31,594 --> 01:29:33,400
to do in the subsequent weeks is now

2097
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:36,424
scale this up to see how, when you have

2098
01:29:36,462 --> 01:29:38,040
more than one active inference agent

2099
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:41,032
together, how the expectations of some

2100
01:29:41,086 --> 01:29:43,052
can impact the expectations of others

2101
01:29:43,106 --> 01:29:46,510
and individuals. And I look forward to

2102
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,790
learning more about that. But as for me,

2103
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,550
that's it.

2104
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:58,626
Amazing. Ben, awesome work. What can

2105
01:29:58,648 --> 01:30:01,526
people look forward to next week or in

2106
01:30:01,548 --> 01:30:04,210
two weeks if they join the discussions

2107
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:05,286
section? Like, what's it going to be

2108
01:30:05,308 --> 01:30:06,726
like? Or who would you encourage to

2109
01:30:06,748 --> 01:30:10,006
join? Definitely, I mean, the more

2110
01:30:10,028 --> 01:30:11,206
people that come along, I think the

2111
01:30:11,228 --> 01:30:12,626
better it's going to be. I'm really

2112
01:30:12,668 --> 01:30:15,914
looking forward to it. I'm kind of just

2113
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:18,266
in the first place, intrigued to see we

2114
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:19,706
covered so much ground. I'm just

2115
01:30:19,728 --> 01:30:21,386
interested to see where people want to

2116
01:30:21,408 --> 01:30:23,626
go with this and see where people's

2117
01:30:23,658 --> 01:30:26,926
interests lie. I assume that people

2118
01:30:26,948 --> 01:30:29,806
are going to have questions, and I think

2119
01:30:29,988 --> 01:30:32,686
maybe the best way to do it would be to

2120
01:30:32,788 --> 01:30:34,590
explore some of people's questions

2121
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,674
during the discussion. We can use them

2122
01:30:36,712 --> 01:30:38,482
to kick things off and keep things

2123
01:30:38,536 --> 01:30:42,100
going, but I think it's likely that

2124
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:44,930
we have a whole hour, so we've certainly

2125
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,798
got time to really dig into things in

2126
01:30:46,824 --> 01:30:49,622
some detail. And like I said before,

2127
01:30:49,676 --> 01:30:52,214
we're going to have Mark Miller with us.

2128
01:30:52,332 --> 01:30:55,986
And Mark is just awesome in discussion.

2129
01:30:56,098 --> 01:30:57,974
It's very, very passionate and

2130
01:30:58,012 --> 01:31:01,154
enthusiastic about his work, and he can

2131
01:31:01,212 --> 01:31:03,146
do a much better job than I can in

2132
01:31:03,168 --> 01:31:06,106
explaining it. So just to have the

2133
01:31:06,128 --> 01:31:07,866
opportunity to speak with Mark about his

2134
01:31:07,888 --> 01:31:10,060
work, I would say definitely come along.

2135
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:13,482
All right. Anything else? Otherwise,

2136
01:31:13,546 --> 01:31:16,746
again, awesome job. No, I think that's

2137
01:31:16,778 --> 01:31:18,862
it. Thanks for listening, I guess.

2138
01:31:18,916 --> 01:31:21,294
Well, thanks. It was a pleasure. It was

2139
01:31:21,332 --> 01:31:25,582
ambitious. To what you did elegantly

2140
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:30,382
with no equations or getting snagged

2141
01:31:30,446 --> 01:31:33,406
on any of the potentially infinite

2142
01:31:33,518 --> 01:31:36,754
philosophical and technical and

2143
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:38,978
normative and all these different layers

2144
01:31:39,074 --> 01:31:43,926
of challenge and divergence. So to

2145
01:31:43,948 --> 01:31:46,374
really cut a path there is great. Yeah.

2146
01:31:46,412 --> 01:31:48,166
I think it just speaks to there's so

2147
01:31:48,188 --> 01:31:50,166
much good philosophical work in these

2148
01:31:50,188 --> 01:31:51,946
areas in enactive inference and

2149
01:31:51,968 --> 01:31:53,594
predictive processing. And I should say,

2150
01:31:53,632 --> 01:31:57,146
again, we didn't really do

2151
01:31:57,168 --> 01:31:58,682
justice to any of the work I talked

2152
01:31:58,736 --> 01:32:01,194
about. So the final thing I would say is

2153
01:32:01,232 --> 01:32:03,898
definitely the document is there with

2154
01:32:03,904 --> 01:32:07,482
the reading, and please go and actually

2155
01:32:07,536 --> 01:32:08,682
look at the work of these people,

2156
01:32:08,736 --> 01:32:12,266
because some of it's really good. All

2157
01:32:12,288 --> 01:32:15,218
right. Till next time. Cool. Thank you

2158
01:32:15,224 --> 01:32:15,940
very much.
