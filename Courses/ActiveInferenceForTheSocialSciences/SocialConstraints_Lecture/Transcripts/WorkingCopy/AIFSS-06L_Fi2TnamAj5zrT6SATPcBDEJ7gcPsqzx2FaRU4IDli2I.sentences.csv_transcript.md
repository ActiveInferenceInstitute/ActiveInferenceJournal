
00:07 _Daniel:_
[[start:7370][end:9126]] Hello and welcome, everyone.
[[start:9228][end:12838]] It's October 18, 2023.
[[start:13004][end:17170]] We're in the course Active Inference for the social sciences.
[[start:17330][end:32480]] And today we're in the lecture by the course co organizer, and that will kick off the final leg of the course, which is Avel Gu√©nin-Carlut lecture, Social Constraints and the Excess Central Stance What Makes US Human.
[[start:32850][end:38442]] So we'll be looking forward to a lecture followed by a discussion.

00:38 [[start:38506][end:44910]] So if you have any questions, please feel free to add them in the live chat or submit to the course syllabus.
[[start:44990][end:49986]] And also at the end, we'll talk about how we're going to conclude this course.
[[start:50088][end:52690]] So with that, thank you to you, Avel.

00:54 _Avel:_
[[start:54410][end:55110]] Hello.
[[start:55260][end:57346]] So, do you see the slides correctly?

00:57 [[start:57378][end:58520]] Everything is fine.

01:02 [[start:62250][end:64920]] I will take Cyland as a yes.
[[start:66490][end:90302]] So the role of this session is basically to show you the inspiring intuition behind the Evolve course and to show very concretely well, very abstractly, but in my mind, concretely why the specific formalism of Active Inference and social constraints is relevant to understand the human species and the cultural evolution of things that we do.
[[start:90436][end:97460]] So we'll talk of social constraints, of the existential stance, and of what makes us human.
[[start:97990][end:112870]] Disclaimer this presentation is closely aligned with the upcoming paper, which, whose name is the same, I think is tentative for now, and whose co author, whose man on job is a co author.
[[start:113770][end:119510]] So first, let us ask basic questions about the topic at hand.

01:59 [[start:119580][end:120870]] What is culture?
[[start:121450][end:124430]] By psychologist Cecilia Hayes.
[[start:124610][end:127514]] Culture is typically used in one of three ways.
[[start:127632][end:130562]] Culture can be information or behavior required socially.
[[start:130646][end:139386]] Like, if I am an ant and I figure out that you need to go somewhere because of pheromones, this is culture.

02:19 [[start:139498][end:143374]] It can be socially equipped behavior that is shared within a group.
[[start:143572][end:152834]] So, for example, if I am an ape and I figure out how to open nuts with a stone thing and the group just everyone does it the same way.
[[start:152872][end:167240]] This is culture and it can be the adaptive evolution of socially acquired behavior, which is like, if I remember well, we have evidence of it in the wild for COVID and humans only.
[[start:167950][end:190250]] So the question is, we know that culture is the human specific, like it is the case simply, but depending on what we mean by culture, it can describe behavior that is very much shared with other species.

03:10 [[start:190410][end:199330]] So a question that needs to be answered is how specific are the human cultural mechanisms?

03:20 [[start:200470][end:208310]] So one core thing to understand is that there is no such thing as the cultural mechanism.
[[start:208650][end:214178]] The mechanisms of social learning in humans, they are culturally transmitted.
[[start:214354][end:224490]] Whether you will listen to, I don't know, elder rapper, Scientist depends on the cultural norms in which you exist.
[[start:225070][end:233070]] And the specific way in which teacher student interaction are supposed to go is again, culturally embedded.
[[start:233730][end:245378]] And the type of information that people will try to figure out is or transmit is itself culturally embedded so we can't just write the mechanism for human social learning.

04:05 [[start:245464][end:254340]] This is like empirically there is none and conceptually I don't think the notion is coherent to begin with.

04:16 [[start:256650][end:269542]] So one core argument for this is we have basically explicit linguistic rules about who we should trust like listen to your parents and those are linguistic.
[[start:269606][end:271766]] And language varies from culture to culture.
[[start:271878][end:276650]] So this changes from culture to culture pretty straightforward.
[[start:277470][end:292850]] And in general the practice of cultural submission, of intentional teaching they are varying between cultures and I do not want to get into it because I don't think I would say something that is accurate without notes.
[[start:293430][end:302850]] And we can however take a look at a behavior that is I think nearly universal, which is storytelling.

05:03 [[start:303190][end:321910]] When people tell story, they use stories to transmit norms and in the specific culture of the Agta or Agta, I have misspelled it at least once, I think it is Agta.

05:22 [[start:322510][end:348130]] You have core role of storytelling in telling people what to do and you have specific tales that were studied and that were stated to specific norms and these are very important because here we have laws that are written somewhere and that people in blue will come and hit you if you don't follow them.
[[start:348200][end:349934]] But this is not something that is universal.
[[start:349982][end:358600]] So in a context where you do not have states, you typically have no really other way to transmit norms than talk about it.

06:02 [[start:362330][end:374358]] From there, everything is culturally embedded, like the way you transmit the norms, the kind of norms can be transmitted given this way, the way specific cues will be understood, given a specific niche, et cetera, et cetera.
[[start:374454][end:388190]] So yes, all this to say there is no big c culture, there is cultural transmission, there is cultural evolution but there is no specific mechanism or actual type of culture in humans.

06:29 [[start:389090][end:404642]] But there are categories of behavior that are very obviously human specifics and that are very obviously cultural as in direct contribution to culture.
[[start:404786][end:405846]] For example fire.
[[start:405948][end:409762]] It's obviously majorly important to culture because if you have fire you get a lot of calories.

06:49 [[start:409826][end:414694]] If you get a lot of calories you get a big brain like you can afford big brain but fire unit doesn't produce culture.
[[start:414742][end:416540]] That's not how anything works.
[[start:417230][end:422478]] Things that do work directly to produce culture are language and role taking.
[[start:422644][end:425294]] So language, I think you are familiar with it.
[[start:425332][end:439186]] You are using it now on the receiving side, it is practice that basically embeds communicative intents into a specific set of symbols that can be letters, that can be words.

07:19 [[start:439368][end:441682]] Like orally it would be phoneme, I guess.
[[start:441816][end:448374]] I don't know if the phoneme or the word is a symbol, but you have symbols and they embed meaning and people use it.
[[start:448412][end:455458]] And what is critical is that each of the symbol has a public meaning, has a public like semantics and pragmatics.

07:35 [[start:455474][end:467734]] If I tell you chair, maybe we don't know precisely like what specific thing enters in the chair category maybe or perceptual installation of chair will vary.
[[start:467782][end:483070]] But we agree on the basics of the chair, we agree on what we can do with chairs, we agree with a lot of things implicitly by the use of this word and we can use the role of syntax to manipulate this unit of meaning in a specific way.

08:03 [[start:483140][end:490530]] I sit on a chair, I'm talking about an action that is relative to a specific object that is a chair and you understand what I mean.
[[start:490600][end:502200]] If I was trying to mimic it, maybe I'll get it through, maybe you would think I'm saying I'm crouching over bed, why not?
[[start:503290][end:524362]] So the language and the fact that it has a publicly instantiated meaning is critical in keeping coordination in the specific thing that people do and why they do it, which is ambiguously cultural and you have another more subtle mechanism process, I don't know, phenomenon which is shared intentionality.

08:44 [[start:524426][end:544802]] So by the work of mainly Tomasello, we know that chimps are not very social and they can learn they are but as intelligent as humans, well, at least young humans, but they usually are not really interested in what?
[[start:544856][end:561770]] Other teams are doing and most importantly, they are not interested in sharing goals trying to figure out what is the end result that some other chimp is upholding and trying to mesh in this plan to help him.

09:21 [[start:561920][end:577600]] While in human from a very young age we are very stream motivated and we are very motivated to figure out what we whatever we are collectively doing and figure out what one's role is in that and do that.
[[start:578130][end:600034]] And this is likely not bona fide cognitive function that stands on its own but it's behavior that is a cognitive process that is endemic in humans very aware if existing everywhere else and that is core to most theory of the transmission of culture.

10:00 [[start:600082][end:611530]] So these two things we know are human specifics up to maybe very small and important details and we know are critically embedded in what we call culture.
[[start:612270][end:620182]] And so what I will do from now on is to provide a specific theory of culture.
[[start:620326][end:636526]] So the Active Inference of culture landscapes that in my opinion basically explains or at least meshes well with why those two specific pheromones are so important from the appalling of culture.

10:36 [[start:636558][end:651154]] But it also means that culture is not information Percy, it's something that is more organic and that evolves more like biological system themselves evolve than population of genes.
[[start:651282][end:675630]] And from these accounts we will go to figure out what it means about collective organization, figure out why we have gods and taxes and from there we will go to more physical and peacemaker consideration and ask how basically this theory can be written within physics through the Active Inference formalism.

11:16 [[start:676930][end:680606]] So let us go first.
[[start:680788][end:691540]] I am just presenting the theory of the Active Inference of clear landscape and I am presenting a core concept, the concept of stroke constraints that derive from at least my treatment of that.
[[start:691990][end:698486]] So Active Inference, probably a lot of you know what this is but this goes on YouTube, so I will re explain.

11:38 [[start:698668][end:704902]] Active Inference is a theory of cognition where basically agents enact expectation of the world.
[[start:704956][end:715750]] They have a world model and they make predictions over the world model and they strive for those predictions to remain coherent with what they actually observe.
[[start:715910][end:720790]] And that means that the agent will update beliefs that are false.
[[start:720950][end:735710]] If I hear meow and I think there is no cat, I will then think that it is more likely.
[[start:735870][end:742774]] And on the other hand, I will try to provoke to realize prediction that I kind of need.

12:22 [[start:742892][end:756694]] So for example, if I really want to hear meal, if I really expect to hear meal and I expect this to be like a basic step of my life, I will maybe figure out how to get a cat that works not well with cats but with drinking or eating.
[[start:756742][end:759734]] Yeah, I expect to be a thing that has water in it because else I die.
[[start:759782][end:763790]] So when I'm thirsty I am thirst by drinking.
[[start:764130][end:776462]] And you have this basically duality of predictive normal, what we call typically perception, just trying to figure out what there is outside and updating our belief when we don't.
[[start:776526][end:786370]] So I said perception but is more inference and there is Active Inference which is like the realization of this inference through action.

13:06 [[start:786870][end:793800]] And a core argument of Active Inference is that those two are same process.
[[start:794330][end:798934]] They are the same process that is entailed by an information geometry.
[[start:798982][end:805370]] So basically a space of belief over which the dynamics of an agent unfold.

13:26 [[start:806190][end:815326]] And a core feature of this approach is the dissolution of agency as we typically understand it.
[[start:815508][end:817066]] We typically understand agency.

13:37 [[start:817098][end:824850]] It will be like hey, I'm an agent, I want to do this and I will reason about what I want and I will reason about how to get it.
[[start:824920][end:827300]] And we'll do the thing that I reasoned about.
[[start:828230][end:830420]] Reason is important.
[[start:830790][end:836600]] It's not the basic cognitive function that analyze everything we do.
[[start:836970][end:839510]] I do not think this statement is controversial.

14:00 [[start:840330][end:853814]] And in Active Inference the model we have is that at multiple scale, in multiple contexts, we produce prediction over our sensor flow and then strive to realize those prediction.
[[start:853942][end:865354]] So what that means is that our action are not constrained by will in a joke case, they are constrained by what looks more like self model, a model of oneself.
[[start:865482][end:872554]] And what oneself would typically do in contexts such as the one I'm exposed.

14:32 _Daniel:_
[[start:872602][end:873200]] To.

14:37 _Avel:_
[[start:877750][end:882526]] Related concepts is the notion of skill and intentionality.
[[start:882638][end:893800]] So this is this skill intentionality thing is a theory that stands at the interface between Active Inference and ecological psychology which I will absolutely not get into.
[[start:894490][end:898858]] And the core argument of skillet and shallity is that when you are a skilled agent.
[[start:898944][end:913550]] So agents that understand how to do things in the world well, you do not experience the world as represented space in 3D with 3D models in it.
[[start:913620][end:922880]] And each object is well defined and has a lot of properties that are embedded in a world model that you have in a video game.

15:23 [[start:923810][end:928954]] What you see is a landscape of basic opportunities for action.
[[start:929002][end:929870]] I will see a computer.
[[start:929940][end:934190]] I know I can mash the keys.
[[start:934610][end:936194]] I think you say keys.
[[start:936362][end:939766]] And I know I can go to the Internet, and I know I can do this or that.

15:39 [[start:939788][end:943302]] I see a door, I know I can go through it if it's open, I can close it.
[[start:943436][end:946294]] I can go through it if it's closed, and I can open it.
[[start:946412][end:949350]] This is the basic opportunities that the door presents.
[[start:950250][end:967310]] And you don't say a logical consequence, but very coherent entitlement of Active Inference is that I will see minimal model of things around me that are based on the opportunities for action that they present.
[[start:967380][end:979810]] I will orient my attention minimally to grasp what I can do with things and what the field, the perceptive field that I live in is a landscape of those affordances.

16:20 [[start:980790][end:986994]] So the picture is an extract from Fallout Novegas, which is the greatest RPG.
[[start:987042][end:987734]] Please play it.
[[start:987772][end:988758]] This is important.
[[start:988924][end:992230]] Only thing you need to keep in mind about this course.
[[start:992380][end:1002550]] And that shows you like, radio in three D F radio, and you have an action button that tells you whether you want to activate the radio.

16:42 [[start:1002630][end:1004582]] And you have HPS and APS.
[[start:1004646][end:1006714]] I have no idea what AP is.
[[start:1006912][end:1022334]] And this looks more like naive feel than what you'd get into a really realistic presentation of, like a picture, photo picture of your environments, because you have the perception of the object.
[[start:1022452][end:1041078]] Like, you have 3D array represents your vision of an object, but it's embedded in things that tell you where you're looking at, things that tell you what you can do with things, things that tell you what are your states, what are your basic states when you're engaging with this object?
[[start:1041244][end:1067378]] And this is, I think, pretty nice illustration of what we could mean by attemption and the landscape for what is actually being transmitted.

17:47 [[start:1067414][end:1069600]] You need less issues.

17:51 _Daniel:_
[[start:1071010][end:1073902]] Sorry, Avel, could you repeat the last 30 seconds there?
[[start:1073956][end:1076420]] It was just like it hung up.
[[start:1077350][end:1079646]] Okay, just repeat the last 30 seconds.
[[start:1079678][end:1080546]] Thank you.

18:00 _Avel:_
[[start:1080728][end:1085026]] So this is a picture from Fallout Nivegas, which is a good game.
[[start:1085208][end:1100214]] And I claim that it is a pretty good illustration of what we talk when we talk about action rated perception, because you see the object and with through the object, you also see what opportunities for action it presents.
[[start:1100262][end:1106090]] In this case, activate the radio and you see it in the way it is embedded with your physiological states.
[[start:1106160][end:1108380]] So the HP and AP.
[[start:1110270][end:1125860]] And a core feature of that is that when I experience affordances, I feel directly through the perception whether the affordance is good or bad.

18:47 [[start:1127030][end:1133570]] If I see, I don't know, a cliff and all, of a sudden I can fall off the cliff and die.
[[start:1134070][end:1135698]] This will cause fair.
[[start:1135864][end:1148370]] The perception of that possibility of falling and dying will be negatively loaded if I see, I don't know, a hot bed in winter and I know I can now rest after a day of work where I was cold.

19:08 [[start:1148450][end:1149494]] I will be happy about it.
[[start:1149532][end:1153866]] I will perceive the possibility in a positively balanced way.

19:14 [[start:1154048][end:1159386]] And so this is the case for basic physiological thing.
[[start:1159568][end:1163546]] But this is also the case for cultural norms and values.
[[start:1163738][end:1171214]] We come to experience the world as a world of affordances and this is the same for the social world.
[[start:1171332][end:1177730]] I will feel bad or good depending on what possibility for action I will experience in a given context.
[[start:1178470][end:1191666]] And this is a picture of forest path near Arcological site that is studied by the research group that funds me escape.

19:51 [[start:1191858][end:1195414]] And from a pure direct perception kind.
[[start:1195452][end:1214140]] Of way there is very complex statistical feature that are embedded in the picture but if you are a human, a thing that walks what you will perceive like feel directly, experience directly is just a possibility to walk along the path and follow it.

20:14 [[start:1214590][end:1219162]] And this is something that you feel is a property of the path.
[[start:1219306][end:1220826]] I think you see the path.
[[start:1220858][end:1222426]] You think I can go through a path?

20:22 [[start:1222458][end:1224990]] You don't think there is a 3d space?
[[start:1225060][end:1231794]] And in this 3d space there is a set of statistical feature, one of which being a flat thing in the middle.
[[start:1231992][end:1240854]] And among the enter space factions they have one of them is to walk through the path like just do this and this and this and this.
[[start:1240892][end:1243160]] You just feel like you can go through there.
[[start:1244410][end:1255994]] And the way humans learn about each other, the way humans gravitate and come to expect things about each other, they can.

20:56 [[start:1256032][end:1261538]] Develop, basically a sense of what is culturally possible or not possible in a given context.
[[start:1261734][end:1269742]] And this sensation, this perception of cultural possibilities, it is embedded in the way we pay attention to things.
[[start:1269796][end:1270926]] We will pay attention to.
[[start:1270948][end:1276900]] Different things according to what is culturally relevant in a given context, in a given situation.

21:17 [[start:1277510][end:1288930]] And this is a core argument of the thinking through the mind account of cultural evolution which was spearheaded by Maxwell, Ramstead and Vesier.

21:29 [[start:1289010][end:1291400]] Forgot his first name.
[[start:1292810][end:1309094]] And because of everything that we saw before, because of the dissolved agency that we have in the active in France the patterns, cultural patterns in the flow of attention they will not simply be experienced.
[[start:1309142][end:1313594]] As abstract norms and value that one could or could not respect.
[[start:1313642][end:1316942]] They will effectively constrain the thing.
[[start:1316996][end:1324870]] You can pay attention to the outcome you expect in a way that will drive your action towards specific outcomes.

22:05 [[start:1325050][end:1337986]] And so this cultural landscape of affordances, they embed intentionality and normativity, as in the patterns that are relevant to explain normativity and intentionality, they are in the landscape.

22:18 [[start:1338018][end:1343190]] They are not like only at least in your brain cells.
[[start:1344570][end:1364846]] And a core argument, I would say, is that the engagement with a cultural landscape, it is duel to existence of social constraints where social constraints are understood as statistical patterns that will causally act over what you do or cannot do.
[[start:1365028][end:1373690]] So when I talk about circulatory landscape forensics, I am implicitly talking about a set of constraints that acts over behavior.
[[start:1373850][end:1379140]] And this I've demonstrated by talking about meditivity and the like.

23:02 [[start:1382870][end:1392200]] You have how to say you have arid nuance in the notion of constraints, which is that.

23:25 _Daniel:_
[[start:1405960][end:1414410]] Avel sorry, again, Avel from your side.
[[start:1414860][end:1416680]] I'm not hearing any audio.

23:40 [[start:1420590][end:1422780]] Mahault or Maria, do you hear him?

23:43 _Mahault:_
[[start:1423390][end:1424138]] No, nothing.

23:44 _Avel:_
[[start:1424224][end:1427430]] You can't write every over collective behavior.
[[start:1427510][end:1429594]] So where is the scale of one specification?
[[start:1429722][end:1430398]] Yes.

23:50 _Daniel:_
[[start:1430564][end:1431440]] All right.
[[start:1432450][end:1435310]] Could you repeat the last 45 seconds?

23:56 _Avel:_
[[start:1436710][end:1438242]] Can you hear me now?

23:58 _Daniel:_
[[start:1438376][end:1439060]] Yeah.

24:00 _Avel:_
[[start:1440470][end:1454258]] Okay, so what I'm saying is that the engagement with cultural landscape forensics, it is dual to the existence of social constraints which act over individual behavior.

24:14 [[start:1454434][end:1469210]] Because when I engage individually with the landscape forensics that is a characteristic of my local material and cultural environments, the embedded will drive my behavior, my intention, my presentation in a specific way.
[[start:1469360][end:1479050]] And instead of looking at how each individual agent engaged with the landscape, I can look at the constraints that emerge from this collective activity.
[[start:1479210][end:1481280]] So is that do you hear me now?

24:44 [[start:1484490][end:1484998]] Okay.

24:45 _Daniel:_
[[start:1485084][end:1485720]] Yeah.

24:48 _Avel:_
[[start:1488190][end:1489340]] Okay, good.

24:53 [[start:1493710][end:1497420]] So let us get back to the question of what makes us human.
[[start:1498110][end:1504410]] We are told about human specific mechanism phenomenon that seemed to be involved in culture.
[[start:1504490][end:1507120]] Those were language and role taking.
[[start:1507650][end:1519742]] And those two phenomenons seem to be pretty robust candidates to explain the coherence of a shared cultural landscape or set of circumstraints language.
[[start:1519806][end:1529190]] It provides a space of public presentation like representation in the classical connectivity sense that you can negotiate that are actually out there in the literal sense.

25:29 [[start:1529260][end:1536418]] They are sensory signals that are in the environment and that structure and Asian behavior.
[[start:1536514][end:1543978]] So when you talk to yourself, it will constrain what you pay attention to implicitly what you can and cannot do.
[[start:1544064][end:1552074]] And when you talk with others, this will influence what you say and what you want to say and what you perceive to be riven to say.

25:52 [[start:1552112][end:1568274]] And so it will constrain your behavior and in a much stronger and more robust way than you could have to implicit intentionality inference and role taking in a more subtle way brings agent to think existentially, to not ask.
[[start:1568312][end:1579014]] The question what I am supposed to do in the situation but what an agent that is embedded in the specific cultural context where I embedded is expected to do.

26:19 [[start:1579212][end:1594278]] And so this basically forces you to have a synchronization between what you experience as possibilities for action and what you expect are cultural expectation over behavior.
[[start:1594454][end:1603520]] So these two mechanisms, there would be very, very strong mechanisms to enforce the coherence of cognitive landscape between agents.
[[start:1603970][end:1613470]] And it just so happens that there are things that exist only in the one species that has full fledged, cumulative, open ended cultural evolution.

26:55 [[start:1615110][end:1619380]] So, yes, I think this is interesting.

27:10 _Daniel:_
[[start:1630850][end:1637620]] Okay, Avel, you just unshared your screen.

27:18 _Avel:_
[[start:1638950][end:1639650]] Sorry?

27:19 _Daniel:_
[[start:1639800][end:1642180]] You unshared your screen, or is that done?

27:23 _Avel:_
[[start:1643110][end:1644980]] No, I did not unshare my screen.

27:27 _Daniel:_
[[start:1647830][end:1649880]] Could you just reshare it?

27:30 _Avel:_
[[start:1650730][end:1651094]] Yeah.

27:31 _Daniel:_
[[start:1651132][end:1651574]] There you go.
[[start:1651612][end:1652406]] All right.
[[start:1652588][end:1653254]] Looks great.

27:33 [[start:1653292][end:1653638]] Continue.
[[start:1653724][end:1654600]] Thank you.

27:36 _Avel:_
[[start:1656890][end:1657640]] Nice.
[[start:1659050][end:1683790]] So, yes, the question is, as I said, there is duality between each agent engaging with a landscape for dense and constraints that exist over the landscape, that is shared, that is straightforward, but in the set of constraints that is characteristic of a given landscape.
[[start:1684450][end:1695150]] Basically, to account for perinetric culture evolution, this must be a set of constraints that changes to time, that builds new constraints and new dymical flow.
[[start:1695310][end:1702402]] And this is something that you cannot get with a landscape in the sense of system theory.
[[start:1702466][end:1708178]] That is not the system theory does not deal with systems that do open ended evolution.

28:28 [[start:1708354][end:1727520]] So the question is, what relation can we make between the dynamics of enculturation according to which agent integrates specific cultural expectation and the dynamics of open ended cultural evolution through which cultural landscape and the constraints constructs itself through time?

28:48 [[start:1728530][end:1741490]] And this is where we get to the more holistic side, where I think we can see why the specific construct of constraints is critical as compared to the simple cultural landscape approach.
[[start:1741910][end:1743540]] Let us take a look at this.
[[start:1744390][end:1748050]] There is a thing called biological autonomy.
[[start:1748210][end:1762860]] It is quite recent term in its formalization, the relevant formalization that describes the ability of a living system for self construction, like maintaining one structure and challenging it through developmental and evolutionary time.

29:23 [[start:1763390][end:1770726]] And the best formalization we have had so far is from Montevil and Mossio, and it's constraint closure.
[[start:1770918][end:1787570]] A constraint is simply a relatively slow physical process that shapes a faster process, like canalized material or information or energy flow without itself being affected at the timescale of the interaction.
[[start:1788230][end:1796702]] And for Monteville Mosio, you get biological autonomy where you get a set of constraints that collectively produce itself.

29:56 [[start:1796856][end:1804758]] Each constraint is produced by other constraints in a set, and each constraint produces other constraints in the set.
[[start:1804924][end:1806854]] This is a very simple ID.

30:06 [[start:1806972][end:1813222]] This is a very informal ID in the sense that it doesn't have dynamics, doesn't have a physics.
[[start:1813366][end:1816810]] It is just a formal statement of what we mean by autonomy.
[[start:1817550][end:1828270]] And this IV basically is the best grounding we have to think about what is living and what is an agent, although in itself it does not entail agency.
[[start:1829170][end:1854322]] And when we look at social systems or any systems as a set of constraints, what you can see is that systems such as the brain multiscale organized system, they can be read as basically a set of nested constraints like your DMN, the activity of your default mode network, which is the basal activity of the brain.
[[start:1854386][end:1866202]] In the absence of stimulation, it basically is constituted of chemical constraints over what the composite tissues do at a given point in time.

31:06 [[start:1866336][end:1879258]] And this itself is a constraint over what individual cells do full time, which itself is a constraint over the evolution law of an individual cell, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[[start:1879354][end:1893780]] So I can always look at a multiscale system as a set of nested constraints at nested scales and in systems that are autonomous, that are biological cognitive agent.
[[start:1895430][end:1901880]] Not only the smaller scale systems like cell.
[[start:1903130][end:1909560]] They enable, they construct, and they enact the constraints that are aeroscale agents.
[[start:1910490][end:1915498]] But aeroscale agents can also shape back the behavior of low scale agent.

31:55 [[start:1915664][end:1926602]] Like of course, if I do something which is something that I as an agent do, this will constrain the activity of my neural networks.

32:06 [[start:1926666][end:1930494]] This is like heavy and learning, this is common to all model of learning.
[[start:1930612][end:1957218]] Learning goes through change in network structure and so there is an opportunity to model emerging agent from collective network activity and to look at the interaction between description at nested scales of behavior and this is applicable very straightforwardly to the human species.
[[start:1957314][end:1969114]] So this is sumerianity state and something that you can look is that it is very dense, it has very dense building that are built in a specific way.
[[start:1969312][end:1976458]] It is near a river which enables the trade at great distance.

32:56 [[start:1976634][end:1993650]] It has a bridge, so entry to the city is constrained to a specific point and it is essentially surrounded by several fields very flatlands, that are rubble, that are fertilized, probably by water from the river.

33:14 [[start:1994150][end:2003880]] And basically all of these feature are enabled the production of first aid societies, societies with a central administration that does stuff.
[[start:2004250][end:2012658]] And these societies will robustly produce context, material context, that favorite is their own survival.
[[start:2012754][end:2017898]] For example, dance settlements it enable you to have everyone together to tell them what to do.
[[start:2017984][end:2034820]] Temples which give a matter of grounding to the authority of the state, bridges that allow you to move things around and to control what gets in and out and more cultural cereal fields that allow you to take the food and bring it back to the city.

33:55 [[start:2035590][end:2072274]] And the production of such settlements and such material environments by states is somewhat robust intercultural phenomenon at a more like ancient or multicultural scale you have a set of process that are critical in the construction and action of norms in humans and most likely common ancestor to those processes is dancing and singing.

34:32 [[start:2072422][end:2073818]] Dancing and singing.
[[start:2073914][end:2078058]] They give you embodied synchronization.
[[start:2078234][end:2081466]] And this is shown to drive development of group identity.
[[start:2081658][end:2086990]] And this gives you, basically, emotional grounding of the norms that are shared within society.

34:47 [[start:2087070][end:2091054]] Because those norms, they are not abstract expectation.
[[start:2091182][end:2096142]] They are embedded in your specific emotions, in your specific embodiment.
[[start:2096206][end:2103282]] While you do things that are critical to your ecology and ritual activity and storytelling.
[[start:2103346][end:2110546]] They allow more complexity of the martivity by using symbolism and the system of tomativity.
[[start:2110578][end:2126190]] There are maybe less embedded, embodied sorry, so less embedded in the one's direct experience but they allow a more complexity in the nature of the norms that are transmitted and enforced.

35:26 [[start:2126930][end:2143230]] And these norms, by the simple fact that they are perceptible through metal symbolism and through storytelling they become a causal force in the cultural landscape that is shared by a group member.

35:43 [[start:2143390][end:2155830]] So they become things that are the power to produce or constrain the framing in which people will read specific situation and therefore constrain and produce social behavior.
[[start:2156410][end:2162166]] And this is, like I've said this already, so this looks like repetition.
[[start:2162198][end:2174654]] But I want to hammer this because if this is the case, then we can be interested in what complex tails sorry.
[[start:2174772][end:2185710]] In agency that emerges from the constraints embedded in complex tails so we know that people can perceive non material agents under certain conditions.

36:26 [[start:2186130][end:2188622]] This is common in schizophrenia.
[[start:2188766][end:2194514]] Like, you will hear voices that tells you to do things and that are not embedded in a specific body.
[[start:2194632][end:2206360]] This is common in decade Valentine's disorder because you will have agents that basically share your body while having and existing, while not being tied to a specific body.

36:49 [[start:2209050][end:2210706]] Sorry, I'm misspeaking.
[[start:2210738][end:2215146]] One specific personality can exist while they are not in control of your body.
[[start:2215248][end:2249590]] And so in a way that is not contingent on the direct material in action of what they want and want not to do, and under a lot of anthropologically described conditions that are not considered pathological, you can basically have regimes of attention that produce enormous reagent that you can talk with and that have motivation and that have limited traits, which are often called tulpas, which is a term borrowed from Buddhist literature.
[[start:2250650][end:2276574]] And so this emergence of the material agent how to say, if I consider an agent to be something a closed set of constraints and I consider things like tails and ritual as mechanism that produce constraints in behavior there is basically no difficulty whatsoever at conceptual level.

37:56 [[start:2276612][end:2286500]] There is no unexpectedness or no complexity to say that specific systems of constraint that happen to be closed and that are embellished in those tales and rituals, they exist as biological agent.

38:08 [[start:2288630][end:2299890]] So we kind of have basically a model of gods, of non material agents which is a better, less logical way to put it that relies on systematic training of your regime of attention.
[[start:2300050][end:2305894]] And of course, when it's collective, it will like those agents will be social agents.
[[start:2305932][end:2312438]] They will be things that have power, that have the ability to frame the debate around specific things.
[[start:2312604][end:2316250]] If you and I think is sorry.
[[start:2316400][end:2322846]] The painting that is on the right of the screen is a painting by William Blake that presents basically.

38:42 [[start:2322948][end:2344014]] A late 18th, I think notion of God, which is not really Old Testament, which is a bit more New Testament, but which is often sensation of the clockmaker God that was popular at the time and what you see on the painting is resent.

39:04 [[start:2344062][end:2363082]] So William Blake's version of God that is in the sky like, very powerful, very juice like imagery and that is using this, his hand, to draw a compass, that is considered a symbol of constructing things of masonry like.
[[start:2363136][end:2367114]] The compass is one of the Freemason symbol for the same reason.
[[start:2367152][end:2372102]] It is a symbol of orderly creation in William Blake's paintings.
[[start:2372246][end:2394146]] And so if we share a belief that there is a God somewhere and he built the world as it is intentionally and this God is benevolent or at least much too powerful for us to fight with basically European they bold on to following the order because if you don't, god will remove you from the order.

39:54 [[start:2394248][end:2396020]] And you don't want that, do you?
[[start:2396650][end:2428160]] So even if you don't have the existence of a material institution of this God, even if people don't really believe that there is actually a guy with a bird that does stuff, the shared ritualized belief in an entity that has this specific motivation and these specific traits, it will shape heavily the social landscape that is available to everyone.

40:28 [[start:2428770][end:2444820]] And this is compatible with although it does not entail the existence of actual agency that is tied to this specific entity through the constraints that this entity concretely is.
[[start:2445190][end:2463866]] And something that I find again interesting is that religion that are popular today so Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism if you think of something as a religion, it will likely fall under this handle are typically what White House call?
[[start:2463888][end:2480080]] Doctrinal religion which are religion that are where basically you sit down and you look at rituals and there is priesthood that is trained to do the ritual in a specific way that is supposed to mean specific things.

41:20 [[start:2480450][end:2493490]] And this is basically optimal to build very robust notions of what gods are, what they want from you, what they do, what they're motivated by, et cetera, et cetera.

41:34 [[start:2494230][end:2500534]] So I must insist that this is with question mark.
[[start:2500732][end:2531310]] But in principle, the Schoenstrains model, it can produce a touristic theory of gods and non material agent sorry, as socially embedded non material agent that are computed collectively through engagement with a specific cultural landscape where ritual and doctrinal elaboration are important components.
[[start:2532850][end:2543970]] And I can say with exclamation mark that this model, it enables naturalistic theory of social agency that is not tied specifically to individual bodies.
[[start:2544470][end:2569594]] If I consider a social system, actual organization to be autonomous, that is closed system of constraints, zane agency or maybe non trivial agency, it simply reduces to the power to shape this landscape and you can have emergent social things do that.

42:49 [[start:2569632][end:2572538]] You can have states which follow specific rules.
[[start:2572634][end:2575802]] So social constraints and specific norms.
[[start:2575866][end:2581710]] So against constraints that have autonomy and that are able to shape the landscape.
[[start:2582130][end:2613534]] But in all of this, this part in my opinion shows that circle constraints specifically are relevant to study these social worlds, that they correspond to relevant social processes in human order, agents that are institutions and maybe again question mark, no matter agents, sorry, material agents into institution.
[[start:2613582][end:2614770]] So gods.

43:35 [[start:2615430][end:2619938]] The question that needs to be asked is how we can model the portion of constraints.
[[start:2620034][end:2641740]] Because all of these rely on the idea that somehow in the landscape that whispers, there is such a thing as constraints and they are well defined thing that exist over a collective behavior and that they have the property to construct itself and for reason we'll very shortly see.

44:02 [[start:2642190][end:2646734]] To frame this mathematically in a coherent way is insanely hard.
[[start:2646852][end:2649566]] I don't know how to do it, no one knows how to do it.
[[start:2649668][end:2653874]] We have leads, but they are leads, nothing else.

44:14 [[start:2654072][end:2661246]] And so we'll turn to the question of whether Active Inference frames a gauge theory for enculturation.
[[start:2661438][end:2665480]] You should know what this is by now, gauge theory, we will see that soon.
[[start:2666890][end:2675810]] So to explain Gold's theory, I need to explain explanation, which is fun, but mostly symmetries in physics.
[[start:2675970][end:2682710]] In physics we frame physical problem around symmetries symmetry.
[[start:2682790][end:2684566]] It is algebraic.

44:44 [[start:2684598][end:2695274]] So something that has composition like plus groups of transformation over the space of possibilities, which are irrelevant from the perspective of the same dynamics.
[[start:2695402][end:2696362]] This is very abstract.
[[start:2696426][end:2698350]] So let's look at symmetries.
[[start:2698850][end:2706994]] This is the ceiling of the Lotfola Mosque, and it's found what you can see is a symmetry under the C 32 symmetry group.

45:07 [[start:2707112][end:2714674]] If you shift this picture by one over 32 full turn, it does not change.

45:14 [[start:2714792][end:2716426]] This is what we mean by a symmetry.
[[start:2716558][end:2722950]] This is a transformation, a set of transformation that is closed and that does not change.
[[start:2723100][end:2730890]] Well, not a picture of course in the context of physics, but the dynamics of the relevant system we are studying.
[[start:2731950][end:2737654]] And for formal reasons I will not absolutely not get into here explanation.
[[start:2737702][end:2741306]] In physics it usually derives from the statement of symmetry.

45:41 [[start:2741418][end:2749598]] For example, when I state that energy is conserved, this is the same formally as stating that my system is symmetric in time.
[[start:2749764][end:2758980]] When I state that momentum is conserved, that reduce formally to stating that my system is asymmetric in space.
[[start:2759430][end:2760226]] Okay?
[[start:2760408][end:2767670]] So most things in physics can be framed as simply symmetries over system dynamics.

46:10 [[start:2770090][end:2776440]] And a Gold theory is simply elaborate instance of this core ID.
[[start:2777130][end:2782002]] So if your symmetry has two properties first, it is continuous.
[[start:2782066][end:2791678]] So not like a set of small rotation, but like the set of all possible rotation that you can take around a circle and local.
[[start:2791764][end:2796000]] So you can apply the symmetry transformation to every single point in space.
[[start:2797090][end:2801210]] Your problem basically can be framed with realm degree of freedom.

46:41 [[start:2801290][end:2809406]] So because the symmetry does not change your system, whether your system where your stem is in the, for example, clockwork rotation.
[[start:2809438][end:2810370]] It is not important.
[[start:2810440][end:2812050]] It does not change the dynamics.
[[start:2812950][end:2816310]] So this redundant degree of freedom we call a gauge parameter.

46:59 [[start:2819610][end:2827430]] The core feature of gauge theory is to take the geometry of that problem and make it into a physical force.
[[start:2827850][end:2853518]] So when I say gorgeous parameter, so this is you should see in the screen nontrivial z over two z possible bundle of a circle, which means basically that you have a circle, it has two stages, and when you are over it, you can be either on top or down, and you can't know where it is.

47:33 [[start:2853604][end:2857982]] So this is not quite the graph freedom because you have only two choices.
[[start:2858046][end:2861118]] To get to the graph freedom, you have to get a continuous space of choices.
[[start:2861294][end:2864110]] But this is basically what we mean by gold parameter.

47:44 [[start:2864190][end:2878806]] It is a geometric property of your system that you know mathematically exists, but that cannot possibly be observed or how to say corresponds to a choice in how you observe your system.
[[start:2878908][end:2883210]] So this is why we talk of GOJ, because this is a choice in how we inspire the system.
[[start:2883280][end:2888060]] But I will not get into the details of this here.
[[start:2889150][end:2900640]] And the thing is that because of its redundancy, the Goch parameter does not have to be the same in a specific trajectory at any given point in space.
[[start:2901250][end:2904014]] And from that you get curvature.

48:24 [[start:2904142][end:2908820]] And curvature if you are anywhere near physics and, you know.

48:37 _Daniel:_
[[start:2917970][end:2922926]] Avil okay, last thing we heard was if you're anywhere.

48:42 _Avel:_
[[start:2922958][end:2928340]] In physics about relativity theory, you will know that curve to the naive embedding space.
[[start:2928790][end:2931694]] So if you know vaguely about relativity.

48:51 _Daniel:_
[[start:2931742][end:2937720]] Theory yes, sorry, just if you're anywhere in physics and then continue from there.

48:58 _Avel:_
[[start:2938250][end:2939000]] Yes.

48:59 [[start:2939850][end:2949078]] So if you are vaguely familiar with relativity theory, you know that curvature in a space, it corresponds to forces.
[[start:2949174][end:2955878]] So in relativity theory, the curvature of spacetime, it corresponds to the gravity force.
[[start:2956054][end:2965642]] And generally in physics, the curvature in other weirder gauge spaces, it translates in the other fundamental forces.
[[start:2965706][end:2970670]] So weak force, strong force and electromagnetism.
[[start:2971570][end:2981022]] So, yes, just stating that there is a space which has a gorge parameter in it and this space has a curvature.

49:41 [[start:2981166][end:2989080]] It entails that you have a force that emerges over the, let us say, natural framing of the problem.
[[start:2990810][end:2996550]] And this speaks very closely to Active Inference.
[[start:2996970][end:3002970]] So Active Inference can be framed as a consequence of a formal result that is called the frenzy principle.

50:03 [[start:3003310][end:3035542]] Let us write a dimmical system stochastic which means that it has noise in it and which can be partitioned between an agent A environment B and boundary sorry, an environment E and a boundary B such that the distribution of the agent and the environment are independent from each other given the distribution of the boundary B, which kind of means that an information in E that is relevant in A and vice versa has to be in B.
[[start:3035596][end:3037078]] But doesn't quite mean that.

50:37 [[start:3037164][end:3038760]] But it's very close.
[[start:3039930][end:3056380]] Then you have an information geometry which is like geometrical construct where each point in the agent corresponds to its position of belief over the space of external states.
[[start:3057630][end:3069294]] And because of this information geometry, each possible internal state of the agent, it entails implicitly a belief over external states.

51:09 [[start:3069492][end:3085300]] So this means that given the condition of partitionability, I can write Bayesian belief over my environment as a simple geometrical property of the space we are working in.
[[start:3085610][end:3091030]] And as I just said, when you have a geometry and it's curved, you get forces.

51:31 [[start:3091690][end:3104950]] And so the FEP can straightforwardly be framed as gauge theory where the symmetries in sensor entropy technically.
[[start:3105030][end:3119120]] But let us say the space of belief I am evolving in directly constrain my action in a specific manner to constrain biasian coherence between what I expect to be the case and what I experience to be the case.
[[start:3119570][end:3129602]] And so straightforwardly this grounds Active Inference because like what I just said is what I said to explain Active Inference up to some technical words that were added in.

52:09 [[start:3129736][end:3146070]] But yes, this result entails predictive processing and predictive control of behavior of the agent and to some extent improves the possibility of this existing in bare dymical system theory.

52:28 [[start:3148250][end:3153478]] But I do not think that the FEP can possibly represent enculturation.
[[start:3153654][end:3158106]] So when I talk of a dynamical system, this is a system with dynamics in it.
[[start:3158208][end:3160960]] You are, I think you understand that.
[[start:3161730][end:3167966]] I do not think you necessarily understand the formalism that we imply by it.
[[start:3168148][end:3176820]] A mixture system is a flow function phi, a time parameter t and a state space x.

52:57 [[start:3177270][end:3186470]] So what that means is that to frame an ecosystem, I have to write a space, let us say, I don't know, just the Euclidean space with three dimension.
[[start:3186810][end:3194806]] I have to specify time, which is like naturally in the occurrence space what we think of as time.

53:14 [[start:3194988][end:3204618]] And I have to specify a specific way in which my system will move in space in a given step of time.
[[start:3204704][end:3214030]] So fear gives from any position and any time slot where the system will be if it starts from this position after the specific time duration.
[[start:3215490][end:3217520]] This is what a unimical system is.

53:38 [[start:3218050][end:3228420]] But if you have noticed this, this entails that I define preemptively all other space of possibilities of my system.
[[start:3229270][end:3249560]] If I have a system that is open ended system of constraints, that can build new stuff, that can build language, that can build accounting, whatever new states this doesn't go, maybe you say we could reconstruct a minimal notion of new stuff happening by working.

54:16 _Daniel:_
[[start:3256090][end:3268732]] Sorry, I'll ask him again, Avel again repeat the last 30 seconds, but your audio is still not there.
[[start:3268786][end:3274552]] It's like a 30 to 42nd period where your audio just doesn't transmit.
[[start:3274616][end:3276110]] None of us can hear it.
[[start:3276800][end:3278510]] But the Internet is fine.

54:40 _Avel:_
[[start:3280160][end:3283692]] Working over the dynamics of the system per se, learning the mechanical system theory.

54:43 [[start:3283756][end:3285090]] So you can do that either.
[[start:3286020][end:3286480]] Fine.

54:46 _Daniel:_
[[start:3286550][end:3287264]] Yeah.
[[start:3287462][end:3288210]] Continue.
[[start:3289460][end:3290610]] Yes, continue.

54:50 _Avel:_
[[start:3290980][end:3291730]] Okay.
[[start:3293700][end:3302870]] So the mixture system can be written as a flow function phi over a state space x and a time parameter t.
[[start:3303800][end:3308408]] When you specify x you specify the total space of possibility of the system.
[[start:3308574][end:3315656]] So if you have a system that has opened any evolution in it well, you cannot work with a fixed space.
[[start:3315838][end:3324750]] You could maybe circumvent the issue by implicitly having new things happen from a change in the dynamics of the system.

55:25 [[start:3325120][end:3334712]] But in Mikel system theory the dynamics are pregiven through the flow function phiical system theory.
[[start:3334776][end:3338428]] System is a specific deterministic flow.
[[start:3338524][end:3348470]] So you can't change the flow through time so you can't model the construction of new constraints and you can't model the emergence of new parameters that affect causality of system.
[[start:3348840][end:3358920]] So the FEP in of itself cannot present the creative evolution of either cognitive kinds such as money shares or constraints.

55:59 [[start:3359820][end:3376264]] And this is where we have to get in weirder spaces formally to get something that looks like it could model open end evolution although I cannot say definitively it can because we didn't yet by construction.

56:16 [[start:3376312][end:3399460]] When we work with set theory which is the basic theory of mathematics which is about specific objects that are predefined we can't have what Kaufman calls adjacent possible which correspond to new evolutionary possibilities that are brought about by the evolution upon an evolution of evolutionary system like living systems.

56:41 [[start:3401480][end:3412372]] Simply, set theory forces you to define all of the possibilities at step one of the modeling process so can't have your system that builds new possibilities through its activity.
[[start:3412436][end:3416768]] This is not a coherent concept in set theory.
[[start:3416964][end:3417612]] However.
[[start:3417746][end:3436880]] What we can do is to look at, rather than set theory at a category theory which is, let us say, another approach to mathematic which looks not at specific objects and their relationship to functions but at specific spaces and their relationships to functions.

57:17 [[start:3437460][end:3448624]] And this change in approach basically does not entail, at least not a priory that when you write a system you have to write all of the possibilities that are within the system preemptively.

57:28 [[start:3448752][end:3458840]] You can write a space and then look at the relationship between the space and other adjacent spaces that could correspond to adjacent possibles.
[[start:3459500][end:3477160]] And one thing that is related to that, at least in spirit is I won't get into detail but formal approaches that allow you to build quantum state spaces from the property of quantum observation rather than the opposite.
[[start:3477320][end:3502020]] So simply speaking, we can look at the problem of how cognition brings about new possible not as a space of possibilities in which there is a flow but as a set of spaces in which specific events such as observation, such as enculturation, such as invention of new concepts can bring about new spaces.

58:22 [[start:3502760][end:3521800]] And when we rewrite Active Inference in the language of category theory we get things that do not quite say the same thing as immaculate system theory like actual Active Inference, actual frenzy principle but we get things that are very very complicated.
[[start:3521880][end:3526936]] So the diagram that you see on the bottom left of the screen is a conecocone diagram.

58:47 [[start:3527128][end:3530016]] I could tell you what a concoction is but I don't know.
[[start:3530038][end:3538560]] So I could not explain that is meant to represent the alignment in reference frame or the mutual Active Inference between two subsystem.
[[start:3539380][end:3544748]] So again, formally we have no reason to believe this can't model upon evolution.
[[start:3544924][end:3556388]] But also given the level of effectness of the math, we have very very few grip with which to understand what we're looking at and how this relate to specific cognitive and cultural processes.
[[start:3556564][end:3579840]] So there is a lot of progress to be made in that direction before we have a self standing theory of open ending cultural evolution and the basic handle of social constraints I think is a good bridge between the very concrete, very simple the immigrant system theory and the very abstract problem of many evolution.

59:40 [[start:3580340][end:3591490]] So let us wrap this up here and try to take out a few snippets of actionable information that was included in the talk.
[[start:3592760][end:3610650]] First, agents by nature they engage with the world with their world as a cognitive landscape that is defined by the modalities by which they perceive the world, that is defined by the intrinsic themativity that the agent experience and that is.

1:00:22 _Daniel:_
[[start:3622230][end:3632566]] Again sorry, just go back 22 seconds but still the audio is not ready yet.
[[start:3632588][end:3636950]] But it's okay, we'll breathe before we jump into the conclusion.

1:00:45 [[start:3645380][end:3648370]] It okay.

1:00:51 [[start:3651940][end:3653330]] Still don't hear you.

1:01:06 [[start:3666170][end:3685040]] No, we can do the slide game where someone else presents the slide.

1:01:25 [[start:3685880][end:3687104]] Any volunteers?
[[start:3687152][end:3687460]] Okay.
[[start:3687530][end:3689030]] Yeah, I heard that.

1:01:29 _Avel:_
[[start:3689720][end:3690660]] Okay, cool.

1:01:30 _Daniel:_
[[start:3690730][end:3691588]] Can you please continue?

1:01:31 _Avel:_
[[start:3691674][end:3692308]] No.
[[start:3692474][end:3696420]] Okay, we'll try to go fast because this is not agreeable.
[[start:3697480][end:3712408]] So one, agents engage with the world as a cognitive landscape which is defined by affordencies so minimal representation of the action that are possible in the landscape and the normativity that's embedded in the possibility of the action.
[[start:3712584][end:3718264]] Two, the fact that humans collectively enact relatively coherent circular landscape.

1:01:58 [[start:3718312][end:3735680]] It entails that we have social constraints over collective behavior and the existence of those social constraints they enable or thought do not necessitate the emergence of higher scale agencies such as institution, organization and maybe godlike beings.
[[start:3736900][end:3742976]] And last, the dynamics of constraints, they entail a duality between the creation of meaning.
[[start:3743008][end:3764044]] So the way we humans create a way to understand the world and the conception of physicals in the sense specific, concrete, causally relevant possibilities that characterize specific social cultural organizations and maybe like physical version paratuses but just don't worry about it.

1:02:44 [[start:3764242][end:3775120]] And all of it is embedded in this diagram the engagement and the duality with a system of constraints that produce itself in a pen in manner.
[[start:3775460][end:3782380]] So a claim that I'm making on the record here is that if we understand correctly every arrow in this diagram.

1:03:02 [[start:3782540][end:3789350]] We understand culture evolution, we understand what human are, and we understand opening evolution in the cultural world.
[[start:3790120][end:3797620]] And here I'll go through the slides in case someone needs a reference and has the time to go through the video to find the reference.
[[start:3798940][end:3799864]] So, thank you.
[[start:3799902][end:3802570]] And sorry about the audio thing.

1:03:25 [[start:3805580][end:3806970]] Did this go well?

1:03:28 _Daniel:_
[[start:3808860][end:3814350]] Yes, it gave some much needed silences, so it was all good.
[[start:3815440][end:3816236]] Cool.
[[start:3816418][end:3823660]] Well, first, Mahault or Maria, if you would like to give any comments or reflections.
[[start:3823740][end:3831890]] Otherwise we can go to a few topics and then talk about how we want to conclude with the course.

1:03:53 [[start:3833460][end:3838070]] But first, Mahault or Maria, do you want to say or ask anything?

1:04:02 _Mahault:_
[[start:3842870][end:3843186]] No.
[[start:3843208][end:3845810]] I mean, this was a great summary.
[[start:3846310][end:3848530]] I think you covered a lot of grounds.
[[start:3849450][end:3872220]] I think, ideally, I would have liked to see how much we can do with gauge theory and how this can potentially link us to understandings of would be that would be interesting.

1:04:40 _Daniel:_
[[start:3880400][end:3880764]] Cool.
[[start:3880802][end:3881980]] Thank you, Maria.
[[start:3883840][end:3884780]] All right.
[[start:3884930][end:3886060]] See you, Maria.
[[start:3886720][end:3887228]] Okay.

1:04:47 [[start:3887314][end:3897040]] Anyone in live chat can ask a question or let's first address the course question while people are writing questions.
[[start:3897110][end:3897724]] Live chat.
[[start:3897772][end:3905680]] So what do you see for the coming weeks as we kind of conclude this first round?

1:05:09 _Avel:_
[[start:3909240][end:3911670]] So you're asking me right.
[[start:3913160][end:3921012]] So, for a reason I do not understand, and Daniel understands, no one came up at the Mahault discussion session.
[[start:3921156][end:3932830]] So I thought it would be interesting to push a presentation for the last session to have everyone saying that things have feedback and I have a current thing to move on from.
[[start:3933440][end:3947360]] The question is whether you feel there is a need for a discussion that is specific for the session we have had just now, because lots of things were covered, lots of audio problems were existing.
[[start:3947940][end:3957372]] And basically the two options are either next session is everyone presents, we give you feedback ciao, or we have a discussion session.

1:05:57 [[start:3957516][end:3966048]] So at the time that was initially planned for the conclusion, and then we have yet another session that will be the conclusion where you will make a presentation and you will get the feedback.
[[start:3966224][end:3974904]] So we'd like to know which is your preference, because both are very possible in my book, but doesn't show anything to me.

1:06:14 [[start:3974942][end:3976680]] So what you want is goals.

1:06:18 _Daniel:_
[[start:3978540][end:3979000]] Yeah.
[[start:3979070][end:3980804]] Mahault also open to your thoughts.

1:06:20 [[start:3980852][end:3986328]] And of course, we're sharing it so that people can write in live chat or let us know in the coming days what they prefer.
[[start:3986504][end:3990748]] I'm down for a discussion of what we covered here.
[[start:3990914][end:4004544]] The slides being linked and going into some of these next steps, and then a form based registration for a presentation only session so that we'll then know exactly who wants to present what.
[[start:4004582][end:4007716]] And then we can ask how many minutes they want to do, or something like that.
[[start:4007738][end:4008660]] But Mahault?

1:06:50 _Mahault:_
[[start:4010840][end:4036824]] Yeah, I think it would be good to get people who are interested in getting more active to come and make a small presentation, explain what they understood, describe the highlights for them, and potentially link it to some topic in social sciences we may not have covered here, but that they now see through a different lens.
[[start:4036872][end:4038270]] I think that would be interesting.

1:07:24 _Daniel:_
[[start:4044500][end:4045250]] Okay.
[[start:4046420][end:4047072]] All right.
[[start:4047126][end:4055270]] I will look through the live chat while avoid getting some water, and then we'll ask any questions that people come up with.

1:07:42 [[start:4062710][end:4067490]] Is there ever symmetric information between or among social entities?

1:07:53 [[start:4073690][end:4080534]] Or maybe from the scripts perspective, Mahault or from the or however you see in relation with the constraints?
[[start:4080582][end:4084410]] I mean, what about asymmetric constraints?

1:08:05 _Mahault:_
[[start:4085550][end:4087434]] I'm not sure I understand the question.
[[start:4087552][end:4092414]] Can the person give a little more detail in terms of in the questions?

1:08:12 _Daniel:_
[[start:4092612][end:4095294]] Okay, evil is back.

1:08:15 [[start:4095332][end:4101530]] But there was a question in the chat about can information ever be symmetric?
[[start:4101690][end:4103330]] You talked about symmetries.
[[start:4103990][end:4114020]] So are those symmetries in the information that two social entities have, or are they in the constraints that entities experience?
[[start:4114730][end:4118630]] But what are the symmetries and what are the breaks?

1:08:41 _Avel:_
[[start:4121610][end:4131846]] I would say that depending which space you model the problem information, it entails symmetry because it has to be readable.
[[start:4131958][end:4143360]] So you have to be a conservation between context or time of something that is considered to be the content of the information bearing thing.
[[start:4144370][end:4157220]] But also it is a symmetry breaking because if you take any presentation format, let's say binary, a random string means nothing, and you have to break the symmetry of the uniform expression to say something.
[[start:4157750][end:4162420]] So it depends very heavily on how specifically you are modeling the problem.
[[start:4162950][end:4185100]] But for fundamental reasons, any mathematical representation, it depends on the implicit model of the symmetries of the system because you won't present things that do not matter, but you have to present things that do matter, and then you have a very uncomfortable amount of freedom over how you want to present any single thing.

1:09:50 _Daniel:_
[[start:4190030][end:4203460]] Certainly this comes up in learning Active Inference and in talking about it like what you described, how many ways there are to model a given thing which is related to which symmetries are preserved, as you mentioned.
[[start:4204150][end:4214930]] So how do we reckon with that space and with the different ways of representing the same social setting?

1:10:16 _Avel:_
[[start:4216410][end:4236454]] So a reason why I'm not quite comfortable with the notion of information is that in all possible settings where I define quantum information theory as not possible because very few people overall think about it, information will be a probability distribution.
[[start:4236502][end:4243210]] It will be like functional over probability submission that is minus to the logarithm of the probability.
[[start:4243290][end:4245360]] That is what self information is.

1:10:45 [[start:4245970][end:4250682]] And this is defined over a probability distribution.
[[start:4250826][end:4253550]] Distribution is defined over state space.
[[start:4253700][end:4257090]] So implicitly information entails differential state space.
[[start:4257240][end:4267010]] So if you want to work over things that are prior to state spaces, you cannot work with information in any coherent definition.

1:11:11 [[start:4271770][end:4288378]] Basically, the one thing you could do that is vaguely inspired from work in quantum information theory, mainly by Christopher first is to not look at the probability, but at the sorry, not to look at the information.

1:11:28 [[start:4288544][end:4305118]] I'm using that term in a colloquial way now because I have to switch meaning information not as a property of the dispersion but as a property of quantum operator that corresponds to observation and that embeds.
[[start:4305134][end:4317480]] Basically, we could say again, in a very, very colloquial sense, something akin to an expectation or a measurement or a synchronization event in the Active Inference model.
[[start:4318090][end:4331980]] And this for a specific type of operator, for a specific type of spaces, you can get basically the space that flows from the operator rather than the other way around.
[[start:4332350][end:4342026]] And then information is like it's not colmogo rough complexity, it's not shaman information, it's not a variant of entropy.

1:12:22 [[start:4342138][end:4350490]] It is basically what is hypothesized by these specific operators that you use to interact with matter and with cultural and material environments.

1:12:30 [[start:4350650][end:4355394]] And maybe there is a big maybe here, I should say maybe one more time.
[[start:4355512][end:4373750]] Maybe this can adapt it in some way to account for the process of ankuration, where basically the process angulation is considered as the integration of specific reference frames, like expectation colloquially.
[[start:4374410][end:4390240]] And this entail the evolution of the cognitive landscape and our social constraints either defined over the cognitive landscape or defined as a self standing mathematical object, I do not know.
[[start:4391170][end:4406878]] But if we have that, and if we have a decent level of understanding of what constraints the evolution of neurofence frames, we have a selfcending theory of the unfolding of creative landscapes and of open ended culture evolution.

1:13:26 [[start:4406974][end:4409202]] This is a sufficient condition, I am sure of that.
[[start:4409336][end:4411540]] But it is very hard to reach.

1:13:35 [[start:4415190][end:4421954]] There are so many threads by which you could take it and each one is like the level of postdoc in mathematics.
[[start:4422002][end:4426802]] And I'm not talking about 19th century mathematics, but talking about algebraic topology.
[[start:4426866][end:4432314]] I'm talking about weird category thing that people only figured out how to define 30 years ago.
[[start:4432432][end:4436634]] So yeah, I'm not confident I will give you an answer to that within five years.
[[start:4436672][end:4437770]] I'm not confident.

1:14:00 _Daniel:_
[[start:4440850][end:4443086]] Wow, very interesting there.
[[start:4443188][end:4445402]] All right, some questions from the chat.
[[start:4445466][end:4455730]] So, first upcycle, Club wrote do you think ritualized storytelling is driven by social constraints?

1:14:16 _Avel:_
[[start:4456550][end:4458526]] Everything is driven by circumstraints.
[[start:4458558][end:4462130]] We just define circumstraints as the contrast that exist over behavior.

1:14:23 [[start:4463750][end:4473142]] If we expect that every night we have to go around the fire and listen to someone tell a story, then yeah, this will happen.
[[start:4473196][end:4480540]] If we expect that we have to go on YouTube and listen to talks about abstract things such as inference, this will happen.
[[start:4481070][end:4487718]] So in this sense, everything, every single activity you have is embedded in landscape or cultural expectation.
[[start:4487894][end:4502590]] And this is why it's pretty hard to talk about basic mechanism of cultural transmission because whichever cognitive mechanism you are looking at is encultured and could in principle and likely has been a few times changed by cultural evolution.

1:15:04 [[start:4504950][end:4505700]] Yes.

1:15:07 _Daniel:_
[[start:4507670][end:4508082]] Cool.
[[start:4508136][end:4526930]] And that takes me back to the scripts discussion in papers, the strong script at exactly this time here's the script that we're all going to read from on through the spaces of weaker scripts like we tend to meet here or there happens to be a path here.
[[start:4527100][end:4527770]] Okay.
[[start:4527920][end:4530666]] So then some comments from M.

1:15:30 [[start:4530688][end:4531530]] Lenin.
[[start:4531870][end:4534250]] One, thank you.
[[start:4534400][end:4540410]] I don't know if making a presentation to explain what one understood is an attractive invitation.
[[start:4540850][end:4544270]] Still, two places I did not track as well as I hope was.
[[start:4544340][end:4556002]] One, dissolution of agency as we know it and two, the informational geometry among agent, environment and boundary went over my head.

1:15:56 [[start:4556056][end:4556820]] Thank you.

1:15:59 [[start:4559460][end:4564720]] So dissolution of agency and agent, environment, boundary.

1:16:05 _Avel:_
[[start:4565220][end:4565980]] Yes.
[[start:4566150][end:4568260]] I will get back to the slides.
[[start:4569800][end:4571380]] Are you seeing the window?

1:16:15 _Daniel:_
[[start:4575480][end:4577412]] Yeah, I'll bring it in.
[[start:4577466][end:4577924]] That's fine.
[[start:4577962][end:4578710]] Thank you.

1:16:20 _Avel:_
[[start:4580440][end:4581190]] Okay.

1:16:24 [[start:4584620][end:4606610]] So the dissolution of agency is basically the idea that when we think about agents, people like we think as a system that has a body and that has a brain and that has the ability for discursion, like deliberating over what you do and not do.
[[start:4607140][end:4611676]] And we place agency at the level of discursive beliefs.
[[start:4611788][end:4625140]] So if I say I want to grab the water and I grab the water, I grab the water out of my agency, if I inadvertently, I don't know, bump into something and make it fall or grab without thinking about it, is it attentive?
[[start:4627000][end:4628256]] Most people would say yes.
[[start:4628298][end:4631560]] But that's actually not entailed by the most used model of agency.

1:17:12 [[start:4632460][end:4643070]] Legally speaking, you are held as not responsible or less responsible of things that you did not have the opportunity to debate over.

1:17:23 [[start:4643520][end:4666080]] But from a purely cognitive perspective and if the Active Inference model is correct, the bulk of the intentionality of your ability to direct your own flow that you have does not come from reasoning and deliberation and central executive system like cognitive function that we associate with reasoning and agency.
[[start:4666920][end:4688600]] It comes from the basic expectation you have yourself and the world because your expectation over the world constraint heavily implicate the opportunities for action that you perceive and your beliefs over yourself constrain just as heavily the options that you will end up pursuing.
[[start:4688940][end:4700750]] And so the agency, your ability to decide of stuff, it mostly reduces to predictive process over your self model and your world model.
[[start:4701360][end:4718188]] And this is while not like I don't see any problem formally or empirically with that picture as I understand it, that comes very well for the neuropsychiatric and psychological literature and sociological literature.

1:18:38 [[start:4718284][end:4728704]] Like this is good, this works scientifically, but this is counterintuitive because again, most people will expect you to have reasoning and then to decide of stuff and then to execute all the stuff you decide.
[[start:4728832][end:4731990]] Which again, I don't think this happens.
[[start:4732680][end:4741390]] So harder question is the information geometry, I kind of glossed over it because yeah.
[[start:4742320][end:4743516]] So the.
[[start:4743538][end:4750456]] Information geometry is a geometry that is defined within his incode system, equipped with a partition, blah, blah, blah.

1:19:10 [[start:4750648][end:4760240]] And so by a geometry, I mean basically a space of curvature that exists over your bezel space.
[[start:4760310][end:4766192]] This is basically the same thing that I'm presenting in the bottom left of the screen.
[[start:4766246][end:4772644]] Here you have a space that is your normal space, where you see stuff happen, which is represented here by the line.
[[start:4772842][end:4781640]] And you have a curvature that is defined by some of the things that are defined over the space and by the Frenzy principle.

1:19:42 [[start:4782220][end:4802540]] When you have this partition condition that is verified, then each state in the agent internal states, like each specific point, it can be corresponds to a belief distribution over the states of the environment.

1:20:03 [[start:4803440][end:4808284]] And so this is in this sense that we have an information geometry like we have a geometry.
[[start:4808332][end:4815970]] So curvature over space, where the space is the internal state of the agent, and the geometry is belief over ethical states.
[[start:4817000][end:4827140]] And furthermore, this matters because the agent isn't actually constrained by the image.
[[start:4829100][end:4846460]] The agent is effectively constrained by the geometry in such a way that its internal flow optimizes the bias and coherence of the belief that exists according to the geometry.

1:20:47 [[start:4847360][end:4855900]] So this is highly math, this is straightforward, but lots of words, lots of section.

1:20:56 [[start:4856260][end:4858768]] No real visual aid, put it.
[[start:4858854][end:4865120]] So this is more something to read about and something to hear about, which is why I glossed over it.
[[start:4865190][end:4869140]] But I hope going over it again brings a bit more of clarity.

1:21:14 _Daniel:_
[[start:4874900][end:4880808]] How would you connect what you just said to the differences with written and oral culture?
[[start:4881004][end:4882960]] Like, what is hearable?
[[start:4883040][end:4884260]] What is seeable?
[[start:4884840][end:4897370]] How does writing in the printed or etched or digitized form relate to how you discussed culture today?

1:21:40 _Avel:_
[[start:4900940][end:4902244]] I see you as frozen.
[[start:4902292][end:4904090]] Danielle, can you hear me?

1:21:45 _Daniel:_
[[start:4905900][end:4907212]] I can hear you.
[[start:4907346][end:4907976]] Mahault.

1:21:48 _Avel:_
[[start:4908088][end:4912030]] Okay, so do answer, or do Mahault answer?

1:21:52 _Daniel:_
[[start:4912480][end:4913996]] Mahault, if you want to.
[[start:4914178][end:4914860]] Yeah, please.

1:21:54 _Mahault:_
[[start:4914930][end:4922464]] I can give a little bit of an idea, but effectively, we're talking about precision and temporality, right?
[[start:4922502][end:4938150]] So writing and discourse, the discourse has to relate to pragmatics, and the discourse is likely to be interpreted because it has lower precision than, say, writing has over time.
[[start:4939080][end:4961704]] So here you're talking about the ways in which the information geometry will be bent and shifted through the precision of the embedded of the embedded normativity that is given rise to through these markers that you can point to over and over and over with high precision.

1:22:41 [[start:4961832][end:4963310]] I think that's the link.

1:22:46 _Avel:_
[[start:4966400][end:4967150]] Basically.
[[start:4968480][end:4982096]] So when I talked about role taking and language, I claim that the core reason why this matter is because this enforce coherence between the cognitive landscape experienced by agents and writing changes massively the scale at which it is possible.
[[start:4982278][end:4988032]] And it changes massively the level of emotional embeddedness of language.
[[start:4988096][end:4997960]] It is much lower in speech than sorry, much higher in speech than it is in writing, especially if you account for singing as a form of speech.
[[start:4998620][end:5006968]] So historically writing very clearly and very ambiguously powered the rise of administration.

1:23:27 [[start:5007064][end:5021440]] So states so organization that do a lot of accounting and bookkeeping like book is literally in the word and that enable the centralization of resource management.
[[start:5022020][end:5029730]] This is explained in detail in the logic of writing by Goody Goody.

1:23:50 [[start:5030340][end:5043190]] And yeah, basically this writing is a core cultural innovation that enables centralized policies, city states, things like that.

1:24:06 _Daniel:_
[[start:5046540][end:5048410]] Yeah, that's very interesting.
[[start:5049580][end:5068844]] So one topic Avel that we've discussed and maybe you could unpack a little bit here is thinking of culture and these cognitive ecosystems leads to consideration of the cognitive security or of different information risk aspects.
[[start:5068892][end:5076130]] So where does that come into play with the formalism or what you discussed here?

1:24:37 _Avel:_
[[start:5077380][end:5092900]] So, from a cognitive security aspect, one thing you can read in the formalism quite directly is that if you control the environment as in the cognitive landscape experienced by agent, you control what the agent do directly.
[[start:5093740][end:5101384]] So there are two things that are very stereotypically associated with cognitive security.

1:25:01 [[start:5101502][end:5105888]] This is Russian propaganda, not quite propaganda.
[[start:5105924][end:5134880]] Cognitive warfare campaigns pretty much around the world more generally the propaganda that is used by authoritarian regimes to get stuff going and the cults that historically are tied to the worry of brain control by evil cults that can control you from afar like you had a telecommand.
[[start:5135400][end:5142596]] And so in both cases actually, let us get back a bit.

1:25:42 [[start:5142698][end:5156090]] When you are a state that does propaganda and when you are a state you can do a lot of material engineering so producing the environmental states in which people live in.
[[start:5156400][end:5173730]] And for example, if you look at the city of Brazilia, which is one of the very few specifically built capital city that exists in the world, there is like one in there is Brazilian and there is like maybe four others.

1:26:14 [[start:5174260][end:5179436]] And those cities are basically very big, glorified administrative centers.
[[start:5179628][end:5190608]] And Brazilian in particular, it has neighborhoods for work, neighborhoods for leisure, neighborhoods for habitation.
[[start:5190704][end:5201192]] It is extremely divided and because of this dividedness you basically don't get to do stuff that are not work or hang out with your family.
[[start:5201326][end:5202852]] That is not a possibility.

1:26:42 [[start:5202996][end:5211980]] And of course this changed massively the way people experience their life and this change massively the topology of this network that can emerge.

1:26:52 [[start:5212800][end:5230210]] But when you are doing cognitive warfare in the sense that NATO defines so you are state or state organization and you are trying to fuck with another state or state organization you don't get to just build cities that are bad but it's not possibility that you have.
[[start:5230660][end:5242660]] So what the Russians do in a systematic way is to try to basically create dots over what information is reliable so that people feel paralyzed.
[[start:5243400][end:5247368]] The target, I must insist critically is not the information that is available.
[[start:5247454][end:5253064]] It shows that people can have the actionability that the people can give to the information.
[[start:5253262][end:5262232]] And so they tend to propagate a lot of conspiracy theory nonsense because it occupies a lot of space and it prevents the possibility for public debates to occur.

1:27:42 [[start:5262376][end:5282208]] And another strategy they use is to manipulate the personal identity that are embedded often in ethnicity or in the case of the US advanced countries where political life is mostly decoupled from ethnicity.

1:28:02 [[start:5282304][end:5285972]] And I understand the irony to say that this is the case in the US.
[[start:5286106][end:5294436]] But you don't have ethnically specific parties or armed forces, so this is less the case than elsewhere.
[[start:5294548][end:5314380]] So in these countries they will use political identity, so they will use republican identity or leftist identity, but mostly republican identity to just push complete nonsense and get people to act in a way that overall destabilizes the grip of the US over their own population.
[[start:5315120][end:5321276]] And so this is the basic way that we do connective warfare.

1:28:41 [[start:5321308][end:5329010]] And you can understand this in terms of social constraints because again, the target is not like information in of itself.
[[start:5330420][end:5336944]] It's the possibility that is afforded by the social context in which we evolve at an instant.
[[start:5337072][end:5341568]] The goal is to create doubts and noise in the public setting.
[[start:5341664][end:5346520]] It's rate constraints that are not compatible with efficient collective organization.

1:29:07 [[start:5347740][end:5366780]] And a way where you do it is when you see it being done in a much more systematic and efficient way is of course with intra state influence where state administrators and state institutions, they try to create grip over a population.

1:29:27 [[start:5367280][end:5380370]] And if you look at the birth of nationalism like we have the notion today that nations are somewhat coherent political groups that let us say the French hang out together and take decision together.
[[start:5381160][end:5389584]] This notion, it's not quite recent, strictly speaking, but the fact that it's dominant, that it is just a standard expectation, is very recent.
[[start:5389632][end:5406600]] And it derives from the French that somehow where a group of administrators somehow managed to convince everyone that they shared identity and they shared mutual obligation, responsibility in virtue of this identity.
[[start:5407120][end:5423756]] And the way in which this happens is they sent instituters in villages and they sent soldiers and the children had to listen to the instituters explain to them that they were French and they needed to do French things like going to war for France.

1:30:23 [[start:5423868][end:5429308]] And if you did not let the children do that, you went to prison.

1:30:29 [[start:5429404][end:5431280]] And no one wants to go to prison.
[[start:5432920][end:5437350]] Of course, I'm doing a very huge caricature here.
[[start:5437800][end:5441510]] There is not a shadowy set of influence that sense.
[[start:5442680][end:5444740]] This is an overspecification.
[[start:5444820][end:5458728]] But what happened is that the French state managed to create a social niche up in a very very foreign villages where French hood became a basic condition of existence.

1:30:58 [[start:5458904][end:5470936]] Most of your social thing, the fact that you were legally recognized as existing, the activities or activities that you had lot of those were embedded in your perception of being French.
[[start:5471128][end:5481664]] And so when this is the case and when you see that administration tends to be on top of things, administration tells you you have to go to war in virtue of your freshness, then you go to war.
[[start:5481702][end:5484044]] You don't fight against the administration.

1:31:24 [[start:5484092][end:5501368]] You fight against whoever administration tells you fact that you have agreed implicitly that you are French beforehand makes this lot harder to resist basically than if the state just sent soldier at you and kidnapped you and gave you a swear until you fight.
[[start:5501534][end:5503960]] This is not how you make things efficient.

1:31:44 [[start:5504540][end:5506404]] Army Ras this way are unorganized.
[[start:5506452][end:5508250]] They are unmotivated, they are not good.
[[start:5508620][end:5516744]] And if you want people to have stakes, you need to give them power or you need to give them the impression they have power because they are French.
[[start:5516792][end:5517212]] And here.
[[start:5517266][end:5520416]] French Governs things.

1:32:00 [[start:5520518][end:5526416]] And whether you are in the set of French that actually direct things or not, bad question to ask.
[[start:5526518][end:5528560]] Just go to the trenches.
[[start:5529060][end:5538550]] And this type of things we would not think as cognitive warfare because we would not think as between.
[[start:5539480][end:5544272]] Implicitly, when we talk about warfare, we talk about between states or between nation conflict.

1:32:24 [[start:5544336][end:5547384]] And this is within a nation, within a social group.

1:32:27 [[start:5547502][end:5553240]] But you can look at cults and how they create social influence.
[[start:5553820][end:5561020]] You can look at, for example, one of the most famous cults that existed, which is the Munis or the Unification Church.
[[start:5562800][end:5566392]] They were widely accused to make brainwashing.
[[start:5566456][end:5570156]] They were accused to somehow control people and make them do things they don't want to do.
[[start:5570178][end:5570984]] That is not a possibility.

1:32:51 [[start:5571032][end:5575424]] You have an organization like you cannot kidnap people and hope that it will be okay.
[[start:5575462][end:5578208]] You will get killed by police if you do that.
[[start:5578294][end:5579760]] Most likely in the US.
[[start:5579910][end:5584976]] In this specific space where the education church evolved.
[[start:5585088][end:5593930]] What you can do is to create a context where you have a huge grip over what people can and cannot say, what they can and cannot think about themselves.

1:33:14 [[start:5594300][end:5605028]] You can tell them that your leader is the coming of Jesus that is going to bring everyone in paradise.

1:33:25 [[start:5605204][end:5617900]] And you can make people go to work sessions, talk about it and you can just physically cling to those people all the time until you are quite confident that they feel that whatever you are doing is important.
[[start:5618050][end:5626284]] And you can have very big emotional ritual where everyone cries and become extremely embedded in the group membership.
[[start:5626412][end:5636492]] And you can be extremely supportive of group members while being extremely aggressive to anything that go away from group identity.
[[start:5636556][end:5643260]] And when you process this environment and people and goats in this environment for a long time, they tend to develop this group identity.

1:34:03 [[start:5643440][end:5657980]] So when you tell them the big leader tells you to give us ‚Ç¨20,000 for your ancestors not to go to hell, that seems reasonable.
[[start:5658400][end:5671664]] That seems like a reasonable ask, which it would not unless you had a very tight control over the social environment of someone because then it's not just giving money in exchange for a good.

1:34:31 [[start:5671702][end:5678160]] This is about upholding your self identity as someone who follows and believes the culture.
[[start:5679060][end:5686096]] And yet again, this is something that is formalized directly in terms of constraints because this is about what you can and cannot do in a given social context.
[[start:5686128][end:5690516]] This is not about abstract beliefs, it's not about brain control.

1:34:50 [[start:5690618][end:5696040]] It's not about anything but what you can and cannot do in a given social context.

1:35:00 _Daniel:_
[[start:5700650][end:5702262]] All right, there was a ton there.
[[start:5702396][end:5706214]] Let me kind of retrace a few of the pieces that I heard there.
[[start:5706252][end:5720140]] So towards framing cognitive security under this cognitive constraint framework that you're discussing, for which Active Inference under the free energy principle is the process theory that gets it done.
[[start:5720510][end:5737378]] First you described how modern states have a lot of administrative capacity and affordances, especially through writing and especially again in the last decades and centuries of information environment changes.
[[start:5737544][end:5748530]] And then you pointed to two kind of patterns or genres or motifs of influence or cognitive warfare, propaganda and cults discussed.

1:35:48 [[start:5748690][end:5754390]] One example of them surely could have gone into more detail, or there's other examples and perspectives and so on.
[[start:5754540][end:5763846]] And as Mahault alluded to earlier, precision modulation is a key aspect of constraint.

1:36:03 [[start:5763878][end:5773514]] I mean, precision modulation of how tightly you're holding the baseball bat, the movement, its precision in wobble is going to be related to the grasp.
[[start:5773642][end:5781434]] And so increasing uncertainty can lead to anxiety and doubt.
[[start:5781482][end:5784006]] All of that's very wrapped up in a narrative setting.

1:36:24 [[start:5784138][end:5798034]] Then you discussed how there's a ratcheting of thinking and acting like a state breaking symmetries like states do, and getting grasp over the subject, over the citizen.
[[start:5798082][end:5811302]] That's a complex topic, but that's what you went and then there are asymmetries around control of the environment, the information environment, ability to read, write, edit in the information environment.
[[start:5811446][end:5828830]] And that leads to these engineered distributions of what is important or what means what, which justifies or even writes the blank check for requests of funds, whatever the narrative is around those funds.

1:37:09 [[start:5829490][end:5848390]] But more fundamentally, those strategies can threaten sense making, which is to say the inbound perceptual component of Active Inference, and then also decision making and action selection, which is the fundamental complement the outbound aspect of Active Inference.

1:37:31 [[start:5851610][end:5853222]] I'll read another comment from the Live.
[[start:5853276][end:5853606]] Oh yeah?
[[start:5853628][end:5855000]] Do you want to add anything else on?

1:37:35 _Avel:_
[[start:5855850][end:5870570]] Like, I'd like to point out a very specific example that is contemporary, which is the campaign by Israel to remove people from the Gaza band.
[[start:5871310][end:5873934]] So just I don't know when people will watch it.

1:37:53 [[start:5873972][end:5891726]] So on the 7 October, 11 days ago, Hamas, which is a terrorist organization, Islamist organization that is dominant in the Gazaban, attacked Israeli and slaughtered IRA settlers that were nearby and slaughtered tourists that were nearby and attacked military bases.
[[start:5891758][end:5894050]] They made, I think, 2000 deaths.

1:38:16 [[start:5896410][end:5921930]] The state of Israel that is currently led by very far right parties, things that we would not have equivalent of in Europe or the US has decided to answer by blaming each individual Palestinian for this and trying to deport them like this is not itself.

1:38:42 [[start:5922000][end:5937118]] What I'm trying to comment about what I'm trying to comment about is that every single comment you will see about it on Twitter makes the confusion between Hamas and Palestinian on one side and Netanyahu and the Israeli on the other side.
[[start:5937284][end:5948280]] And so this produces a framing that says basically people are trying to decide whether the AMAs action are justified or not.
[[start:5948730][end:5952242]] And implicitly in this debate, they create a context.
[[start:5952386][end:5961000]] Wherever group lose the GMAC debate gets to be killed to the last.

1:39:21 [[start:5961930][end:5979178]] And so you produce very, very basically that produce a framing that makes the only possibility in the conflict extermination, because each side this is not two side dynamic.
[[start:5979194][end:5989650]] There is no Palestinian and there is the Israeli and there is the I will not make all the relation but by this framing.

1:39:50 [[start:5990310][end:5995010]] Like the framing that either the Arabs or the Jew must prevail and kill the other.
[[start:5995160][end:6009590]] You give a lot of power for groups to just make this a genocidal war and justify things like cutting water to 1 million people because like, 200 of them committed massacre.
[[start:6010410][end:6015194]] And I do not know if there is a single actor that tried to get this.

1:40:15 [[start:6015232][end:6017018]] I do not think this is the case.
[[start:6017184][end:6025040]] But this is a very powerful instance of how procrang that does not need to target what you believe, but it does need to target how you frame problems.

1:40:31 _Daniel:_
[[start:6031670][end:6032274]] Yeah.
[[start:6032392][end:6034530]] Lot to say on that.
[[start:6034680][end:6040180]] Any last pieces you want to discuss?

1:40:43 _Avel:_
[[start:6043110][end:6044420]] No, it is good.
[[start:6045590][end:6046770]] I have talked a lot.
[[start:6046840][end:6050300]] I'd like to stop talking you.

1:40:52 _Daniel:_
[[start:6052270][end:6054874]] Okay, well, thank you.
[[start:6055072][end:6064138]] We will send out updates to people about the coming weeks, so thank you.

1:41:04 [[start:6064224][end:6066250]] All right, bye.

1:41:06 _Avel:_
[[start:6066990][end:6067850]] Ciao.
[[start:6068350][end:6070410]] Thanks for your attention.
[[start:6070990][end:6071590]] Goodbye.
