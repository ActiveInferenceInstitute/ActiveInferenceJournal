00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,374
You. Hello and

2
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:11,474
welcome, everyone. It's October 18,

3
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:15,106
2023. We're in the course active

4
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:17,606
inference for the social sciences. And

5
00:00:17,628 --> 00:00:20,598
today we're in the lecture by the course

6
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:23,014
co organizer, and that will kick off the

7
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:26,498
final leg of the course, which is Avel

8
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:28,262
Gwenin Carlos lecture, Social

9
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:29,882
Constraints and the Excess Central

10
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,480
Stance What Makes US Human.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,410
So we'll be looking forward to a lecture

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,246
followed by a discussion. So if you have

13
00:00:39,268 --> 00:00:41,806
any questions, please feel free to add

14
00:00:41,828 --> 00:00:43,826
them in the live chat or submit to the

15
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:46,194
course syllabus. And also at the end,

16
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:48,402
we'll talk about how we're going to

17
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:50,946
conclude this course. So with that,

18
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,690
thank you to you, Avel.

19
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,882
Hello. So, do you see the slides

20
00:00:56,946 --> 00:00:58,520
correctly? Everything is fine.

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,920
I will take Cyland as a yes.

22
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,194
So the role of this session is basically

23
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:12,102
to show you the inspiring intuition

24
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:15,162
behind the Evolve course and to show

25
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:17,526
very concretely well, very abstractly,

26
00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:19,934
but in my mind, concretely why the

27
00:01:19,972 --> 00:01:21,994
specific formalism of active inference

28
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:24,846
and social constraints is relevant to

29
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:27,182
understand the human species and the

30
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:30,302
cultural evolution of things that we do.

31
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:33,986
So we'll talk of social constraints, of

32
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:36,402
the existential stance, and of what

33
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:40,130
makes us human. Disclaimer this

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,626
presentation is closely aligned with the

35
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:45,794
upcoming paper, which, whose name is the

36
00:01:45,832 --> 00:01:48,738
same, I think is tentative for now,

37
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:51,734
and whose co author, whose man on job is

38
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:56,118
a co author. So first,

39
00:01:56,204 --> 00:01:58,550
let us ask basic questions about the

40
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,054
topic at hand. What is culture? By

41
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:05,466
psychologist Cecilia Hayes. Culture is

42
00:02:05,488 --> 00:02:07,514
typically used in one of three ways.

43
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:09,542
Culture can be information or behavior

44
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:12,782
required socially. Like, if I am an ant

45
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,054
and I figure out that you need to go

46
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:18,282
somewhere because of pheromones,

47
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,586
this is culture. It can be socially

48
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:22,494
equipped behavior that is shared within

49
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:25,742
a group. So, for example, if I am an ape

50
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:29,010
and I figure out how to open nuts with a

51
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,890
stone thing and the group just everyone

52
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,970
does it the same way. This is culture

53
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,278
and it can be the adaptive evolution of

54
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:38,534
socially acquired behavior, which is

55
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:40,822
like, if I remember well, we have

56
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:45,014
evidence of it in the wild for

57
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,240
COVID and humans only.

58
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,420
So the question is,

59
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,250
we know that culture is the human

60
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,758
specific, like it is the case simply,

61
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:00,734
but depending on what we mean by

62
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:04,206
culture, it can describe behavior that

63
00:03:04,228 --> 00:03:09,102
is very much shared with

64
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:13,026
other species. So a

65
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:14,594
question that needs to be answered is

66
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:18,206
how specific are the human cultural

67
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:22,642
mechanisms? So one

68
00:03:22,696 --> 00:03:24,598
core thing to understand is that there

69
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,394
is no such thing as the cultural

70
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:29,894
mechanism. The mechanisms of social

71
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:33,042
learning in humans, they are culturally

72
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:35,814
transmitted. Whether you will listen to,

73
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:39,770
I don't know, elder rapper,

74
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,318
Scientist depends on the cultural norms

75
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:46,394
in which you exist. And the specific way

76
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:49,386
in which teacher student interaction are

77
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:52,234
supposed to go is again, culturally

78
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:55,646
embedded. And the type of information

79
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:58,654
that people will try to figure out is or

80
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:01,322
transmit is itself culturally embedded

81
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:04,178
so we can't just write the mechanism for

82
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:07,538
human social learning. This is like

83
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:09,714
empirically there is none and

84
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:12,786
conceptually I don't think the notion is

85
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:14,340
coherent to begin with.

86
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,462
So one core argument for this is we have

87
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:22,658
basically explicit linguistic rules

88
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:26,022
about who we should trust like listen

89
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,842
to your parents and those are

90
00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:30,746
linguistic. And language varies from

91
00:04:30,768 --> 00:04:34,266
culture to culture. So this changes from

92
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:35,722
culture to culture pretty

93
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:39,258
straightforward. And in general the

94
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:41,774
practice of cultural submission, of

95
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:45,242
intentional teaching they are varying

96
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:47,806
between cultures and I do not want to

97
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:49,806
get into it because I don't think I

98
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:51,754
would say something that is accurate

99
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:55,474
without notes. And we

100
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:59,026
can however take a look at a

101
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,006
behavior that is I think nearly

102
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:03,602
universal, which is storytelling. When

103
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:07,862
people tell story, they use

104
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:13,094
stories to transmit norms and in

105
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:16,322
the specific culture of the Agta

106
00:05:16,386 --> 00:05:19,702
or Agta, I have misspelled it at least

107
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:23,500
once, I think it is Agta. You have

108
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,326
core role of storytelling in telling

109
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:29,580
people what to do and you have specific

110
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,242
tales that were studied and that were

111
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:37,550
stated to specific norms and

112
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,006
these are very important because here we

113
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:43,662
have laws that are written somewhere and

114
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:47,026
that people in blue will come and hit

115
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:48,546
you if you don't follow them. But this

116
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:50,146
is not something that is universal. So

117
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:51,874
in a context where you do not have

118
00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:55,334
states, you typically have no really

119
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:57,734
other way to transmit norms than talk

120
00:05:57,772 --> 00:05:58,600
about it.

121
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,386
From there, everything is culturally

122
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:06,086
embedded, like the way you transmit the

123
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,926
norms, the kind of norms can be

124
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:10,394
transmitted given this way, the way

125
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:12,794
specific cues will be understood, given

126
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,358
a specific niche, et cetera, et cetera.

127
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:17,514
So yes, all this to say there is no big

128
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:19,706
c culture, there is cultural

129
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:20,778
transmission, there is cultural

130
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:22,478
evolution but there is no specific

131
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:26,654
mechanism or actual type of

132
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:28,190
culture in humans.

133
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,734
But there are categories

134
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:34,738
of behavior that are very obviously

135
00:06:34,824 --> 00:06:36,994
human specifics and that are very

136
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:39,378
obviously cultural as in direct

137
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:43,910
contribution to

138
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,258
culture. For example fire. It's

139
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:47,906
obviously majorly important to culture

140
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:49,366
because if you have fire you get a lot

141
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:50,426
of calories. If you get a lot of

142
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:51,578
calories you get a big brain like you

143
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,718
can afford big brain but fire unit

144
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:55,498
doesn't produce culture. That's not how

145
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:58,810
anything works. Things that do work

146
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,938
directly to produce culture are language

147
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:04,174
and role taking. So language, I think

148
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:06,014
you are familiar with it. You are using

149
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,640
it now on the receiving side,

150
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,930
it is practice that basically embeds

151
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,490
communicative intents into a specific

152
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,454
set of symbols that can be letters,

153
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:20,578
that can be words. Like orally it would

154
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:22,626
be phoneme, I guess. I don't know if the

155
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:25,234
phoneme or the word is a symbol, but you

156
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:27,478
have symbols and they embed meaning and

157
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:29,654
people use it. And what is critical is

158
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:32,982
that each of the symbol has a public

159
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,998
meaning, has a public like semantics and

160
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:38,058
pragmatics. If I tell you chair, maybe

161
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:41,242
we don't know precisely like what

162
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:43,206
specific thing enters in the chair

163
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:45,210
category maybe or perceptual

164
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,914
installation of chair will vary. But we

165
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:51,466
agree on the basics of the chair, we

166
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:53,406
agree on what we can do with chairs, we

167
00:07:53,428 --> 00:07:56,574
agree with a lot of things implicitly by

168
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:59,246
the use of this word and we can use the

169
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:01,386
role of syntax to manipulate this unit

170
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:04,090
of meaning in a specific way. I sit on a

171
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,234
chair, I'm talking about an action that

172
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:08,786
is relative to a specific object that is

173
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:10,530
a chair and you understand what I mean.

174
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,098
If I was trying to mimic it, maybe I'll

175
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:16,214
get it through, maybe you would think

176
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:20,966
I'm saying I'm crouching over bed,

177
00:08:21,148 --> 00:08:24,726
why not? So the language and

178
00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:26,086
the fact that it has a publicly

179
00:08:26,118 --> 00:08:28,330
instantiated meaning is critical in

180
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,786
keeping coordination in the specific

181
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:34,074
thing that people do and why they do it,

182
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:37,098
which is ambiguously cultural and you

183
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:39,710
have another more subtle mechanism

184
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,094
process, I don't know, phenomenon which

185
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:45,182
is shared intentionality. So by the work

186
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:49,578
of mainly Tomasello, we know that chimps

187
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:54,482
are not very social and

188
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:56,354
they can learn they are but as

189
00:08:56,392 --> 00:08:59,746
intelligent as humans, well, at least

190
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:03,634
young humans, but they usually are not

191
00:09:03,672 --> 00:09:05,450
really interested in what? Other teams

192
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,158
are doing and most importantly, they are

193
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:10,694
not interested in sharing goals trying

194
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:13,974
to figure out what is the end result

195
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:17,434
that some other chimp is upholding and

196
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:20,778
trying to mesh in this plan to

197
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:23,834
help him. While in human from a very

198
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:25,850
young age we are very stream motivated

199
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,182
and we are very motivated to figure out

200
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,866
what we whatever we are collectively

201
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:35,706
doing and figure out what one's

202
00:09:35,738 --> 00:09:38,814
role is in that and do that. And this

203
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:41,294
is likely not bona fide cognitive

204
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:43,630
function that stands on its own but it's

205
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,202
behavior that is a cognitive process

206
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:49,602
that is endemic in humans very

207
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:54,600
aware if existing everywhere else and

208
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,754
that is core to most theory

209
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:00,454
of the transmission of culture. So these

210
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:03,826
two things we know are human specifics

211
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:06,010
up to maybe very small and important

212
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,050
details and we know are critically

213
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,418
embedded in what we call culture. And so

214
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:17,258
what I will do from now on is to

215
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:20,182
provide a specific theory of culture.

216
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:21,938
So the active inference of culture

217
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:26,206
landscapes that in my opinion basically

218
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:30,510
explains or at least meshes well with

219
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,270
why those two specific pheromones are

220
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,178
so important from the appalling of

221
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:37,886
culture. But it also means that culture

222
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:40,914
is not information Percy, it's something

223
00:10:40,952 --> 00:10:44,790
that is more organic and that evolves

224
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,710
more like biological system themselves

225
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,574
evolve than population of genes. And

226
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:55,866
from these accounts we will go to figure

227
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,158
out what it means about collective

228
00:10:57,174 --> 00:10:59,546
organization, figure out why we have

229
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:02,762
gods and taxes and from

230
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:05,946
there we will go to more physical and

231
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:09,854
peacemaker consideration and ask how

232
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:11,754
basically this theory can be written

233
00:11:11,802 --> 00:11:14,346
within physics through the active

234
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:18,560
inference formalism. So let us go

235
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,714
first. I am just presenting the theory

236
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:24,414
of the active inference of clear

237
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:26,410
landscape and I am presenting a core

238
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,990
concept, the concept of stroke

239
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,354
constraints that derive from at least my

240
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:33,650
treatment of that. So active inference,

241
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,918
probably a lot of you know what this is

242
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:37,814
but this goes on YouTube, so I will re

243
00:11:37,852 --> 00:11:40,166
explain. Active inference is a theory of

244
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:43,650
cognition where basically agents enact

245
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,526
expectation of the world. They have a

246
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:47,830
world model and they make predictions

247
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,982
over the world model and they strive

248
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:53,718
for those predictions to remain coherent

249
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,186
with what they actually observe. And

250
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,374
that means that the agent will update

251
00:11:58,422 --> 00:12:03,130
beliefs that are false. If I hear

252
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,160
meow and I think there is no cat,

253
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,946
I will then think that it is more

254
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,874
likely. And on the other hand, I will

255
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:21,394
try to provoke to realize prediction

256
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,894
that I kind of need. So for example, if

257
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:26,614
I really want to hear meal, if I really

258
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:28,566
expect to hear meal and I expect this to

259
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:31,366
be like a basic step of my life, I will

260
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:34,042
maybe figure out how to get a cat that

261
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:35,914
works not well with cats but with

262
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:37,546
drinking or eating. Yeah, I expect to be

263
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:38,954
a thing that has water in it because

264
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:42,142
else I die. So when I'm thirsty I am

265
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:45,054
thirst by drinking. And you have this

266
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:50,282
basically duality of predictive normal,

267
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:52,478
what we call typically perception, just

268
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,966
trying to figure out what there is

269
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:56,146
outside and updating our belief when we

270
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:58,754
don't. So I said perception but is more

271
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:01,342
inference and there is active inference

272
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,674
which is like the realization of this

273
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:08,230
inference through action. And a core

274
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,334
argument of active inference is that

275
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:14,998
those two are same process. They are

276
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:17,846
the same process that is entailed by an

277
00:13:17,868 --> 00:13:20,058
information geometry. So basically a

278
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:22,966
space of belief over which the dynamics

279
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:26,794
of an agent unfold. And a

280
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:31,434
core feature of this approach is the

281
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:34,194
dissolution of agency as we typically

282
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:36,670
understand it. We typically understand

283
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,174
agency. It will be like hey, I'm an

284
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:41,102
agent, I want to do this and I will

285
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:43,466
reason about what I want and I will

286
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:45,586
reason about how to get it. And we'll do

287
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:48,738
the thing that I reasoned about. Reason

288
00:13:48,824 --> 00:13:52,770
is important. It's not the basic

289
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,294
cognitive function that analyze

290
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:58,054
everything we do. I do not think this

291
00:13:58,092 --> 00:14:01,206
statement is controversial. And in

292
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:03,366
active inference the model we have is

293
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:05,666
that at multiple scale, in multiple

294
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:09,142
contexts, we produce prediction over our

295
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:12,598
sensor flow and then strive to realize

296
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:15,066
those prediction. So what that means is

297
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,082
that our action are not constrained by

298
00:14:17,216 --> 00:14:20,058
will in a joke case, they are

299
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:23,582
constrained by what looks more like self

300
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:26,062
model, a model of oneself. And what

301
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,274
oneself would typically do in contexts

302
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:32,554
such as the one I'm exposed.

303
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:33,200
To.

304
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,246
Related concepts is the notion of skill

305
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,386
and intentionality. So this is this

306
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:47,822
skill intentionality thing is a theory

307
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,414
that stands at the interface between

308
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:51,074
active inference and ecological

309
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:52,966
psychology which I will absolutely not

310
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:56,166
get into. And the core argument of

311
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,926
skillet and shallity is that when you

312
00:14:57,948 --> 00:15:00,554
are a skilled agent. So agents that

313
00:15:00,752 --> 00:15:02,940
understand how to do things in the world

314
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,300
well, you do not experience the world as

315
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,630
represented space in 3D with 3D

316
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,214
models in it. And each object is well

317
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:18,094
defined and has a lot of properties that

318
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:21,294
are embedded in a world model that you

319
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:25,454
have in a video game. What you see is

320
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:28,606
a landscape of basic opportunities for

321
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,398
action. I will see a computer. I know I

322
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:34,190
can mash the keys.

323
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,414
I think you say keys. And I know I can

324
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:39,286
go to the Internet, and I know I can do

325
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:41,126
this or that. I see a door, I know I can

326
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,742
go through it if it's open, I can close

327
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:45,218
it. I can go through it if it's closed,

328
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:47,186
and I can open it. This is the basic

329
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:49,350
opportunities that the door presents.

330
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,022
And you don't say a logical consequence,

331
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:58,534
but very coherent entitlement

332
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,738
of active inference is that I will

333
00:16:01,904 --> 00:16:04,926
see minimal model of things around me

334
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:06,398
that are based on the opportunities for

335
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:08,714
action that they present. I will orient

336
00:16:08,762 --> 00:16:10,638
my attention minimally to grasp what I

337
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:14,162
can do with things and what the

338
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:16,994
field, the perceptive field that I live

339
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:19,810
in is a landscape of those affordances.

340
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,162
So the picture is an extract from

341
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,426
Fallout Novegas, which is the greatest

342
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:28,758
RPG. Please play it. This is important.

343
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:31,254
Only thing you need to keep in mind

344
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,590
about this course. And that shows you

345
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,046
like, radio in three D F

346
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:40,090
radio, and you have an action button

347
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,658
that tells you whether you want to

348
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:43,962
activate the radio. And you have HPS and

349
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:46,714
APS. I have no idea what AP is.

350
00:16:46,912 --> 00:16:50,870
And this looks more like naive

351
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,822
feel than what you'd get into a really

352
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:56,286
realistic presentation of, like a

353
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:58,974
picture, photo picture of your

354
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:00,718
environments, because you have the

355
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:03,520
perception of the object. Like, you have

356
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,118
3D array represents your vision of

357
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:09,634
an object, but it's embedded in things

358
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,602
that tell you where you're looking at,

359
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,978
things that tell you what you can do

360
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:15,186
with things, things that tell you what

361
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,694
are your states, what are your basic

362
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:20,326
states when you're engaging with this

363
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:23,398
object? And this is,

364
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:27,350
I think, pretty nice illustration

365
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,466
of what we could mean by attemption and

366
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:46,938
the landscape for what is actually being

367
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:49,600
transmitted. You need less issues.

368
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,862
Sorry, Avel, could you repeat the last

369
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,442
30 seconds there? It was just like it

370
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:58,798
hung up. Okay, just repeat

371
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:01,394
the last 30 seconds. Thank you. So this

372
00:18:01,432 --> 00:18:03,630
is a picture from Fallout Nivegas,

373
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,386
which is a good game. And I claim that

374
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:09,334
it is a pretty good illustration of what

375
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:12,194
we talk when we talk about action rated

376
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:14,294
perception, because you see the object

377
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:17,462
and with through the object, you also

378
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:19,786
see what opportunities for action it

379
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,626
presents. In this case, activate the

380
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:23,578
radio and you see it in the way it is

381
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:26,090
embedded with your physiological states.

382
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,380
So the HP and AP.

383
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,094
And a core feature of

384
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:36,558
that is that when I experience

385
00:18:36,644 --> 00:18:40,938
affordances, I feel directly

386
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:43,854
through the perception whether the

387
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:47,586
affordance is good or bad. If I

388
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:51,058
see, I don't know, a cliff and all,

389
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:52,834
of a sudden I can fall off the cliff and

390
00:18:52,872 --> 00:18:55,698
die. This will cause fair.

391
00:18:55,864 --> 00:18:58,386
The perception of that possibility of

392
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:00,638
falling and dying will be negatively

393
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:03,718
loaded if I see, I don't know, a hot bed

394
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:06,470
in winter and I know I can now rest

395
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,646
after a day of work where I was cold. I

396
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:10,066
will be happy about it. I will perceive

397
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:13,174
the possibility in a positively balanced

398
00:19:13,222 --> 00:19:17,494
way. And so this is the case for basic

399
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:20,474
physiological thing. But this is also

400
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:23,546
the case for cultural norms and values.

401
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:25,758
We come to experience the world as a

402
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,374
world of affordances and this is

403
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:31,822
the same for the social world. I will

404
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:34,154
feel bad or good depending on what

405
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:36,258
possibility for action I will experience

406
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:42,114
in a given context. And this

407
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:44,962
is a picture of forest path near

408
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:48,934
Arcological site that is studied by

409
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:51,666
the research group that funds me escape.

410
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:55,414
And from a pure direct perception kind.

411
00:19:55,452 --> 00:19:59,202
Of way there is very complex

412
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,738
statistical feature that are embedded in

413
00:20:01,744 --> 00:20:04,554
the picture but if you are a human, a

414
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:08,310
thing that walks what you will perceive

415
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,086
like feel directly, experience directly

416
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:12,026
is just a possibility to walk along the

417
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:15,910
path and follow it. And this

418
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,222
is something that you feel is a property

419
00:20:18,276 --> 00:20:20,826
of the path. I think you see the path.

420
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,558
You think I can go through a path? You

421
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:25,406
don't think there is a 3d space? And in

422
00:20:25,428 --> 00:20:27,666
this 3d space there is a set of

423
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:29,794
statistical feature, one of which being

424
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:33,582
a flat thing in the middle. And among

425
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:36,274
the enter space factions they have one

426
00:20:36,312 --> 00:20:38,422
of them is to walk through the path like

427
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:40,854
just do this and this and this and this.

428
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:42,534
You just feel like you can go through

429
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:45,926
there. And the

430
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:49,640
way humans learn about each other,

431
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,226
the way humans gravitate and come to

432
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:55,786
expect things about each other, they

433
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:57,786
can. Develop, basically a sense of what

434
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,818
is culturally possible or not possible

435
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:03,722
in a given context. And this sensation,

436
00:21:03,786 --> 00:21:05,226
this perception of cultural

437
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:08,446
possibilities, it is embedded in the

438
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,174
way we pay attention to things. We will

439
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:11,966
pay attention to. Different things

440
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:14,966
according to what is culturally relevant

441
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:16,274
in a given context, in a given

442
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:19,102
situation. And this is a core argument

443
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,610
of the thinking through the mind account

444
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,140
of cultural evolution which was

445
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,054
spearheaded by Maxwell, Ramstead and

446
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:31,400
Vesier. Forgot his first name.

447
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:36,630
And because of everything that we saw

448
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,234
before, because of the dissolved agency

449
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:41,354
that we have in the active in France the

450
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:43,878
patterns, cultural patterns in the flow

451
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:48,342
of attention they will not simply

452
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:51,466
be experienced. As abstract norms and

453
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,214
value that one could or could not

454
00:21:53,252 --> 00:21:55,866
respect. They will effectively constrain

455
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:58,606
the thing. You can pay attention to the

456
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,280
outcome you expect in a way that will

457
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,902
drive your action towards specific

458
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:07,230
outcomes. And so this cultural landscape

459
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,110
of affordances, they embed

460
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,434
intentionality and normativity, as in

461
00:22:12,472 --> 00:22:14,306
the patterns that are relevant to

462
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:16,206
explain normativity and intentionality,

463
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:19,014
they are in the landscape. They are not

464
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:23,190
like only at least in your brain cells.

465
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,974
And a core argument, I would

466
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:31,654
say, is that the engagement with

467
00:22:31,692 --> 00:22:33,898
a cultural landscape, it is duel to

468
00:22:33,904 --> 00:22:36,154
existence of social constraints where

469
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:37,770
social constraints are understood as

470
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,222
statistical patterns that will causally

471
00:22:41,286 --> 00:22:44,846
act over what you do or cannot do.

472
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:47,098
So when I talk about circulatory

473
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:49,674
landscape forensics, I am implicitly

474
00:22:49,722 --> 00:22:52,142
talking about a set of constraints that

475
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:55,262
acts over behavior. And this I've

476
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:58,062
demonstrated by talking about meditivity

477
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,140
and the like.

478
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:07,574
You have how to say you

479
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:10,486
have arid nuance in the notion of

480
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:12,200
constraints, which is that.

481
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,120
Avel sorry,

482
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:29,850
again,

483
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,944
Avel from your side. I'm not hearing any

484
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:36,680
audio.

485
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,754
Mao or Maria, do you hear him? No,

486
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:46,522
nothing. You can't write every over

487
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:48,310
collective behavior. So where is the

488
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,846
scale of one specification? Yes. All

489
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:54,462
right. Could you repeat the last 45

490
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,746
seconds? Can you hear me

491
00:23:57,768 --> 00:24:01,220
now? Yeah. Okay,

492
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,450
so what I'm saying is that the

493
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,286
engagement with cultural landscape

494
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:11,294
forensics, it is dual to the existence

495
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:13,014
of social constraints which act over

496
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,366
individual behavior. Because when I

497
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,394
engage individually with the landscape

498
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:19,814
forensics that is a characteristic of my

499
00:24:19,852 --> 00:24:21,106
local material and cultural

500
00:24:21,138 --> 00:24:24,894
environments, the embedded

501
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:27,334
will drive my behavior, my intention,

502
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,818
my presentation in a specific way. And

503
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:31,514
instead of looking at how each

504
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:32,826
individual agent engaged with the

505
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:35,754
landscape, I can look at the constraints

506
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:38,234
that emerge from this collective

507
00:24:38,282 --> 00:24:41,280
activity. So is that do you hear me now?

508
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,720
Okay. Yeah.

509
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,340
Okay, good.

510
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,186
So let us get back to the question of

511
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:59,162
what makes us human. We are told about

512
00:24:59,216 --> 00:25:02,314
human specific mechanism phenomenon

513
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:04,410
that seemed to be involved in culture.

514
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,120
Those were language and role taking.

515
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,622
And those two phenomenons seem to be

516
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,934
pretty robust candidates to explain the

517
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,858
coherence of a shared cultural landscape

518
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:19,986
or set of circumstraints language. It

519
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:21,950
provides a space of public presentation

520
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,902
like representation in the classical

521
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:26,422
connectivity sense that you can

522
00:25:26,476 --> 00:25:28,358
negotiate that are actually out there in

523
00:25:28,364 --> 00:25:30,674
the literal sense. They are sensory

524
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:33,942
signals that are in the environment and

525
00:25:33,996 --> 00:25:36,774
that structure and Asian behavior. So

526
00:25:36,812 --> 00:25:39,702
when you talk to yourself, it will

527
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:41,546
constrain what you pay attention to

528
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:43,978
implicitly what you can and cannot do.

529
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:46,698
And when you talk with others, this will

530
00:25:46,864 --> 00:25:49,018
influence what you say and what you want

531
00:25:49,024 --> 00:25:51,686
to say and what you perceive to be riven

532
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,406
to say. And so it will constrain your

533
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:56,014
behavior and in a much stronger and more

534
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:58,062
robust way than you could have to

535
00:25:58,116 --> 00:26:01,262
implicit intentionality inference and

536
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:04,766
role taking in a more subtle way brings

537
00:26:04,878 --> 00:26:08,002
agent to think existentially, to not

538
00:26:08,056 --> 00:26:10,818
ask. The question what I am supposed to

539
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:13,506
do in the situation but what an agent

540
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:15,070
that is embedded in the specific

541
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,654
cultural context where I embedded is

542
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:21,494
expected to do. And so this basically

543
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:24,546
forces you to have a synchronization

544
00:26:24,658 --> 00:26:26,950
between what you experience as

545
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,962
possibilities for action and what you

546
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,482
expect are cultural expectation over

547
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:35,814
behavior. So these two mechanisms,

548
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:38,220
there would be very, very strong

549
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,694
mechanisms to enforce the coherence of

550
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:44,334
cognitive landscape between agents. And

551
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:46,862
it just so happens that there are things

552
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:49,646
that exist only in the one species that

553
00:26:49,668 --> 00:26:52,346
has full fledged, cumulative, open ended

554
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:55,618
cultural evolution. So,

555
00:26:55,704 --> 00:26:59,380
yes, I think this is interesting.

556
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,230
Okay, Avel,

557
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,620
you just unshared your screen.

558
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,346
Sorry? You unshared your screen, or is

559
00:27:21,368 --> 00:27:24,354
that done? No, I did not unshare my

560
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:24,980
screen.

561
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,286
Could you just reshare it? Yeah. There

562
00:27:31,308 --> 00:27:33,254
you go. All right. Looks great.

563
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:34,600
Continue. Thank you.

564
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,860
Nice. So, yes, the question is,

565
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,554
as I said, there is duality between each

566
00:27:46,592 --> 00:27:48,714
agent engaging with a landscape for

567
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:52,254
dense and constraints that

568
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:55,054
exist over the landscape, that is

569
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:58,766
shared, that is straightforward, but in

570
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:01,040
the set of constraints that is

571
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,790
characteristic of a given landscape.

572
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,950
Basically, to account for perinetric

573
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,186
culture evolution, this must be a set of

574
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,730
constraints that changes to time, that

575
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,382
builds new constraints and new dymical

576
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:16,562
flow. And this is something that you

577
00:28:16,616 --> 00:28:20,070
cannot get with a landscape in the

578
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,302
sense of system theory. That is not the

579
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:26,402
system theory does not deal with systems

580
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:29,014
that do open ended evolution. So the

581
00:28:29,052 --> 00:28:32,214
question is, what relation can we make

582
00:28:32,332 --> 00:28:34,498
between the dynamics of enculturation

583
00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:36,242
according to which agent integrates

584
00:28:36,306 --> 00:28:38,298
specific cultural expectation and the

585
00:28:38,304 --> 00:28:39,686
dynamics of open ended cultural

586
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,446
evolution through which cultural

587
00:28:41,478 --> 00:28:46,266
landscape and the constraints constructs

588
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:49,614
itself through time? And this is where

589
00:28:49,652 --> 00:28:52,014
we get to the more holistic side,

590
00:28:52,212 --> 00:28:55,746
where I think we can see why the

591
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,490
specific construct of constraints is

592
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,650
critical as compared to the simple

593
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,546
cultural landscape approach. Let us take

594
00:29:02,568 --> 00:29:06,050
a look at this. There is a thing called

595
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,194
biological autonomy. It is quite recent

596
00:29:10,242 --> 00:29:12,818
term in its formalization, the relevant

597
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,498
formalization that describes the ability

598
00:29:14,594 --> 00:29:16,342
of a living system for self

599
00:29:16,396 --> 00:29:18,086
construction, like maintaining one

600
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:19,466
structure and challenging it through

601
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,860
developmental and evolutionary time.

602
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,866
And the best formalization we have had

603
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,474
so far is from Montevil and Mossio, and

604
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:32,586
it's constraint closure. A constraint

605
00:29:32,698 --> 00:29:35,722
is simply a relatively slow physical

606
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:38,814
process that shapes a faster process,

607
00:29:38,932 --> 00:29:41,550
like canalized material or information

608
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,706
or energy flow without itself being

609
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:46,706
affected at the timescale of the

610
00:29:46,728 --> 00:29:50,638
interaction. And for Monteville Mosio,

611
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:53,026
you get biological autonomy where you

612
00:29:53,048 --> 00:29:55,202
get a set of constraints that

613
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:57,174
collectively produce itself. Each

614
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,806
constraint is produced by other

615
00:29:58,828 --> 00:30:01,462
constraints in a set, and each

616
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:04,006
constraint produces other constraints in

617
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:06,854
the set. This is a very simple ID.

618
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,314
This is a very informal ID in the sense

619
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:12,198
that it doesn't have dynamics, doesn't

620
00:30:12,214 --> 00:30:14,566
have a physics. It is just a formal

621
00:30:14,598 --> 00:30:16,810
statement of what we mean by autonomy.

622
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,034
And this IV basically is

623
00:30:21,072 --> 00:30:22,606
the best grounding we have to think

624
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:24,046
about what is living and what is an

625
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:27,006
agent, although in itself it does not

626
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:30,606
entail agency. And when

627
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:34,074
we look at social systems or any systems

628
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:37,298
as a set of constraints, what you can

629
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:39,406
see is that systems such as the brain

630
00:30:39,598 --> 00:30:43,026
multiscale organized system, they can

631
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:44,974
be read as basically a set of nested

632
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:48,994
constraints like your DMN, the activity

633
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:52,342
of your default mode network, which is

634
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:54,598
the basal activity of the brain. In the

635
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:58,440
absence of stimulation, it basically

636
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,934
is constituted of chemical constraints

637
00:31:00,982 --> 00:31:04,406
over what the composite tissues

638
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:06,922
do at a given point in time. And this

639
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:09,994
itself is a constraint over what

640
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:13,402
individual cells do full time, which

641
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:15,486
itself is a constraint over the

642
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:17,626
evolution law of an individual cell, et

643
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:20,014
cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So I can

644
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:22,766
always look at a multiscale system as a

645
00:31:22,788 --> 00:31:25,006
set of nested constraints at nested

646
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,140
scales and in systems that are

647
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,622
autonomous, that are biological

648
00:31:32,686 --> 00:31:36,820
cognitive agent. Not only the

649
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,880
smaller scale systems like cell.

650
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,254
They enable, they construct, and they

651
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:48,914
enact the constraints that are aeroscale

652
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:52,202
agents. But aeroscale agents can also

653
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,886
shape back the behavior of low scale

654
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:58,506
agent. Like of course, if I

655
00:31:58,528 --> 00:32:01,162
do something which is something that I

656
00:32:01,216 --> 00:32:04,734
as an agent do, this will constrain the

657
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:07,006
activity of my neural networks. This is

658
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:09,102
like heavy and learning, this is common

659
00:32:09,156 --> 00:32:11,502
to all model of learning. Learning goes

660
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:15,122
through change in network structure and

661
00:32:15,256 --> 00:32:18,900
so there is an opportunity to model

662
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,854
emerging agent from collective

663
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:27,158
network activity and to look at

664
00:32:27,164 --> 00:32:29,382
the interaction between description at

665
00:32:29,436 --> 00:32:33,240
nested scales of behavior and

666
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,222
this is applicable very

667
00:32:35,276 --> 00:32:37,218
straightforwardly to the human species.

668
00:32:37,314 --> 00:32:41,338
So this is sumerianity state and

669
00:32:41,424 --> 00:32:45,066
something that you can look is that it

670
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,886
is very dense, it has very dense

671
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:48,330
building that are built in a specific

672
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,382
way. It is near a river which

673
00:32:52,436 --> 00:32:56,458
enables the trade at great distance.

674
00:32:56,634 --> 00:32:59,582
It has a bridge, so entry to the city is

675
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:02,238
constrained to a specific point and it

676
00:33:02,244 --> 00:33:04,734
is essentially surrounded by several

677
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,894
fields very flatlands, that are rubble,

678
00:33:06,942 --> 00:33:10,174
that are fertilized,

679
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:13,650
probably by water from the river.

680
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,610
And basically all of these feature are

681
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,650
enabled the production of first aid

682
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,306
societies, societies with a central

683
00:33:22,338 --> 00:33:24,902
administration that does stuff. And

684
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,922
these societies will robustly produce

685
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:31,186
context, material context, that favorite

686
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,366
is their own survival. For example,

687
00:33:33,468 --> 00:33:36,154
dance settlements it enable you to have

688
00:33:36,192 --> 00:33:37,546
everyone together to tell them what to

689
00:33:37,568 --> 00:33:39,978
do. Temples which give a matter of

690
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,300
grounding to the authority of the state,

691
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,006
bridges that allow you to move things

692
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:46,846
around and to control what gets in and

693
00:33:46,868 --> 00:33:50,222
out and more cultural cereal fields that

694
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:53,166
allow you to take the food and bring it

695
00:33:53,188 --> 00:33:57,246
back to the city. And the production

696
00:33:57,278 --> 00:33:59,886
of such settlements and such material

697
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:03,854
environments by states is somewhat

698
00:34:03,902 --> 00:34:09,814
robust intercultural phenomenon at

699
00:34:09,852 --> 00:34:13,830
a more like ancient or

700
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,566
multicultural scale you

701
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:21,158
have a set of process that are critical

702
00:34:21,254 --> 00:34:24,038
in the construction and action of norms

703
00:34:24,134 --> 00:34:27,530
in humans and most likely

704
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,842
common ancestor to those processes is

705
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:33,214
dancing and singing. Dancing and

706
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:37,050
singing. They give you embodied

707
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,518
synchronization. And this is shown to

708
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:41,466
drive development of group identity.

709
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:43,470
And this gives you, basically,

710
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,826
emotional grounding of the norms that

711
00:34:45,848 --> 00:34:48,642
are shared within society. Because those

712
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:50,222
norms, they are not abstract

713
00:34:50,286 --> 00:34:53,490
expectation. They are embedded in your

714
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,378
specific emotions, in your specific

715
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:58,454
embodiment. While you do things that are

716
00:34:58,652 --> 00:35:01,954
critical to your ecology and ritual

717
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:04,280
activity and storytelling. They allow

718
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,774
more complexity of the martivity by

719
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:10,038
using symbolism and the system of

720
00:35:10,044 --> 00:35:11,274
tomativity. There are maybe less

721
00:35:11,312 --> 00:35:14,234
embedded, embodied sorry, so less

722
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:18,378
embedded in the one's direct

723
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:20,540
experience but they allow a more

724
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,322
complexity in the nature of the norms

725
00:35:23,386 --> 00:35:26,190
that are transmitted and enforced.

726
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,030
And these norms,

727
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,262
by the simple fact that they are

728
00:35:33,316 --> 00:35:35,794
perceptible through metal symbolism and

729
00:35:35,832 --> 00:35:38,306
through storytelling they become a

730
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:41,070
causal force in the cultural landscape

731
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,762
that is shared by a group member. So

732
00:35:43,816 --> 00:35:47,622
they become things that are the power to

733
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:49,686
produce or constrain the framing in

734
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:50,822
which people will read specific

735
00:35:50,876 --> 00:35:53,702
situation and therefore constrain and

736
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:55,830
produce social behavior.

737
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,326
And this is, like I've

738
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,754
said this already, so this looks like

739
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,274
repetition. But I want to hammer this

740
00:36:03,312 --> 00:36:05,740
because if this is the case,

741
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,458
then we can be interested in what

742
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:14,654
complex tails sorry.

743
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:17,102
In agency that emerges from the

744
00:36:17,156 --> 00:36:19,870
constraints embedded in complex tails so

745
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,386
we know that people can perceive non

746
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:24,782
material agents under certain

747
00:36:24,836 --> 00:36:27,442
conditions. This is common in

748
00:36:27,496 --> 00:36:29,922
schizophrenia. Like, you will hear

749
00:36:29,976 --> 00:36:32,258
voices that tells you to do things and

750
00:36:32,264 --> 00:36:33,842
that are not embedded in a specific

751
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:35,998
body. This is common in decade

752
00:36:36,014 --> 00:36:37,574
Valentine's disorder because you will

753
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,134
have agents that basically share your

754
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:43,702
body while having and existing, while

755
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:46,360
not being tied to a specific body.

756
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,398
Sorry, I'm misspeaking. One specific

757
00:36:51,484 --> 00:36:53,946
personality can exist while they are not

758
00:36:53,968 --> 00:36:56,362
in control of your body. And so in a way

759
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:59,210
that is not contingent on the direct

760
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,338
material in action of what they want and

761
00:37:01,424 --> 00:37:05,840
want not to do, and under a lot of

762
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,870
anthropologically described conditions

763
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,150
that are not considered pathological,

764
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:17,086
you can basically have regimes of

765
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:19,638
attention that produce enormous reagent

766
00:37:19,674 --> 00:37:21,266
that you can talk with and that have

767
00:37:21,288 --> 00:37:23,730
motivation and that have limited traits,

768
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,706
which are often called tulpas, which is

769
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:28,690
a term borrowed from Buddhist

770
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:33,270
literature. And so

771
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,000
this emergence of the material agent

772
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,094
how to say, if I consider an agent to be

773
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:43,690
something a closed set of constraints

774
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:50,150
and I consider things like tails

775
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,758
and ritual as mechanism that produce

776
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:54,346
constraints in behavior there is

777
00:37:54,368 --> 00:37:56,118
basically no difficulty whatsoever at

778
00:37:56,144 --> 00:37:56,926
conceptual level. There is no

779
00:37:56,948 --> 00:37:58,814
unexpectedness or no complexity to say

780
00:37:58,852 --> 00:38:01,246
that specific systems of constraint that

781
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:02,158
happen to be closed and that are

782
00:38:02,164 --> 00:38:04,074
embellished in those tales and rituals,

783
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:06,500
they exist as biological agent.

784
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,546
So we kind of have basically a model of

785
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:13,362
gods, of non material agents which is a

786
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,082
better, less logical way to put it that

787
00:38:16,136 --> 00:38:18,774
relies on systematic training of your

788
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:21,320
regime of attention. And of course,

789
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,662
when it's collective, it will like those

790
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:26,246
agents will be social agents. They will

791
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:29,286
be things that have power, that have the

792
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,382
ability to frame the debate around

793
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:35,538
specific things. If you and I think is

794
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:38,042
sorry. The painting that is on the right

795
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:40,486
of the screen is a painting by William

796
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,658
Blake that presents basically. A late

797
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:46,720
18th, I think notion of God, which is

798
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,574
not really Old Testament, which is a bit

799
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:53,438
more New Testament, but which is often

800
00:38:53,524 --> 00:38:57,578
sensation of the clockmaker God

801
00:38:57,764 --> 00:39:01,234
that was popular at the time and what

802
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:04,322
you see on the painting is resent. So

803
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:07,286
William Blake's version of God that is

804
00:39:07,308 --> 00:39:09,062
in the sky like, very powerful, very

805
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:12,440
juice like imagery and that is using

806
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,926
this, his hand, to draw a compass, that

807
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:21,398
is considered a symbol of constructing

808
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:23,946
things of masonry like. The compass is

809
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:26,906
one of the Freemason symbol for the same

810
00:39:26,928 --> 00:39:29,366
reason. It is a symbol of orderly

811
00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:32,102
creation in William Blake's paintings.

812
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:34,446
And so if we share a belief that there

813
00:39:34,468 --> 00:39:36,798
is a God somewhere and he built the

814
00:39:36,804 --> 00:39:40,094
world as it is intentionally and this

815
00:39:40,132 --> 00:39:42,846
God is benevolent or at least much too

816
00:39:42,868 --> 00:39:45,886
powerful for us to fight with basically

817
00:39:45,988 --> 00:39:50,366
European they bold on to following

818
00:39:50,398 --> 00:39:52,818
the order because if you don't, god will

819
00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:54,878
remove you from the order. And you don't

820
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:58,326
want that, do you? So even if you

821
00:39:58,348 --> 00:40:01,960
don't have the existence of

822
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,806
a material institution of this God,

823
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:10,298
even if people don't really believe that

824
00:40:10,384 --> 00:40:12,746
there is actually a guy with a bird that

825
00:40:12,768 --> 00:40:16,810
does stuff, the shared ritualized

826
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,514
belief in an entity that has this

827
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:21,862
specific motivation and these specific

828
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:25,886
traits, it will shape heavily the

829
00:40:25,908 --> 00:40:27,566
social landscape that is available to

830
00:40:27,588 --> 00:40:31,150
everyone. And this is compatible

831
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,738
with although it

832
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:36,770
does not entail the existence of actual

833
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,690
agency that is tied to this specific

834
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,354
entity through the constraints that this

835
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:46,306
entity concretely is. And something that

836
00:40:46,328 --> 00:40:48,646
I find again interesting is that

837
00:40:48,748 --> 00:40:51,382
religion that are popular today so

838
00:40:51,436 --> 00:40:54,470
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism

839
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,186
if you think of something as a religion,

840
00:40:57,218 --> 00:41:00,860
it will likely fall under this

841
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,642
handle are typically what White House

842
00:41:03,696 --> 00:41:06,250
call? Doctrinal religion which are

843
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,506
religion that are where basically you

844
00:41:08,528 --> 00:41:11,642
sit down and you look at rituals and

845
00:41:11,696 --> 00:41:16,138
there is priesthood that is trained

846
00:41:16,234 --> 00:41:18,366
to do the ritual in a specific way that

847
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:20,080
is supposed to mean specific things.

848
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:23,150
And this is basically optimal to build

849
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,166
very robust notions of what gods

850
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:29,714
are, what they want from you, what they

851
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:32,206
do, what they're motivated by, et

852
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:36,574
cetera, et cetera. So I

853
00:41:36,712 --> 00:41:39,750
must insist that this is with question

854
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,150
mark. But in principle,

855
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:47,480
the Schoenstrains model, it can

856
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,334
produce a touristic theory of gods and

857
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:54,086
non material agent sorry, as socially

858
00:41:54,118 --> 00:41:55,546
embedded non material agent that are

859
00:41:55,568 --> 00:41:58,774
computed collectively through engagement

860
00:41:58,822 --> 00:42:02,038
with a specific cultural landscape where

861
00:42:02,224 --> 00:42:08,030
ritual and doctrinal elaboration

862
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,310
are important components.

863
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:16,882
And I can say with exclamation mark that

864
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:19,358
this model, it enables naturalistic

865
00:42:19,374 --> 00:42:21,342
theory of social agency that is not tied

866
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:23,970
specifically to individual bodies.

867
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,910
If I consider a social system, actual

868
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,694
organization to be autonomous, that is

869
00:42:30,732 --> 00:42:34,130
closed system of constraints, zane

870
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,462
agency or maybe non trivial agency, it

871
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:41,942
simply reduces to the power to shape

872
00:42:42,086 --> 00:42:45,340
this landscape and

873
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,386
you can have emergent social things do

874
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:51,370
that. You can have states which follow

875
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,330
specific rules. So social constraints

876
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,478
and specific norms. So against

877
00:42:56,564 --> 00:42:59,694
constraints that have autonomy and that

878
00:42:59,732 --> 00:43:02,894
are able to shape the landscape. But in

879
00:43:02,932 --> 00:43:06,370
all of this, this part in my opinion

880
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:10,798
shows that circle

881
00:43:10,814 --> 00:43:13,218
constraints specifically are relevant to

882
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:15,426
study these social worlds, that they

883
00:43:15,528 --> 00:43:25,534
correspond to relevant

884
00:43:25,582 --> 00:43:27,570
social processes in human order, agents

885
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,362
that are institutions and maybe again

886
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:32,194
question mark, no matter agents, sorry,

887
00:43:32,312 --> 00:43:33,842
material agents into institution. So

888
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:36,646
gods. The question that needs to be

889
00:43:36,668 --> 00:43:39,206
asked is how we can model the portion of

890
00:43:39,228 --> 00:43:41,554
constraints. Because all of these rely

891
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:44,918
on the idea that somehow in the

892
00:43:45,004 --> 00:43:47,538
landscape that whispers, there is such a

893
00:43:47,564 --> 00:43:50,602
thing as constraints and they are well

894
00:43:50,656 --> 00:43:52,986
defined thing that exist over a

895
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:55,690
collective behavior and that they have

896
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,562
the property to construct itself and

897
00:43:59,616 --> 00:44:02,650
for reason we'll very shortly see. To

898
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,906
frame this mathematically in a coherent

899
00:44:04,938 --> 00:44:07,486
way is insanely hard. I don't know how

900
00:44:07,508 --> 00:44:09,886
to do it, no one knows how to do it. We

901
00:44:09,908 --> 00:44:13,090
have leads, but they are leads, nothing

902
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,450
else. And so we'll turn to the question

903
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,834
of whether active inference frames a

904
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:21,746
gauge theory for enculturation. You

905
00:44:21,768 --> 00:44:23,406
should know what this is by now, gauge

906
00:44:23,438 --> 00:44:25,480
theory, we will see that soon.

907
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:30,486
So to explain Gold's theory, I need

908
00:44:30,508 --> 00:44:32,902
to explain explanation, which is fun,

909
00:44:32,956 --> 00:44:36,294
but mostly symmetries in physics. In

910
00:44:36,332 --> 00:44:40,458
physics we frame physical problem around

911
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:44,566
symmetries symmetry. It is algebraic.

912
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:47,242
So something that has composition like

913
00:44:47,296 --> 00:44:50,026
plus groups of transformation over the

914
00:44:50,048 --> 00:44:52,542
space of possibilities, which are

915
00:44:52,596 --> 00:44:54,286
irrelevant from the perspective of the

916
00:44:54,308 --> 00:44:56,362
same dynamics. This is very abstract.

917
00:44:56,426 --> 00:44:59,582
So let's look at symmetries. This is the

918
00:44:59,636 --> 00:45:01,738
ceiling of the Lotfola Mosque, and it's

919
00:45:01,754 --> 00:45:04,286
found what you can see is a symmetry

920
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:07,554
under the C 32 symmetry group. If you

921
00:45:07,592 --> 00:45:12,340
shift this picture by one over 32

922
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,138
full turn, it does not change. This is

923
00:45:15,144 --> 00:45:17,174
what we mean by a symmetry. This is a

924
00:45:17,212 --> 00:45:18,962
transformation, a set of transformation

925
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:22,086
that is closed and that does

926
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:24,726
not change. Well, not a picture of

927
00:45:24,748 --> 00:45:27,362
course in the context of physics, but

928
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,946
the dynamics of the relevant system we

929
00:45:29,968 --> 00:45:34,134
are studying. And for formal reasons

930
00:45:34,182 --> 00:45:36,826
I will not absolutely not get into here

931
00:45:37,008 --> 00:45:38,682
explanation. In physics it usually

932
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,306
derives from the statement of symmetry.

933
00:45:41,418 --> 00:45:43,966
For example, when I state that energy is

934
00:45:43,988 --> 00:45:46,814
conserved, this is the same formally as

935
00:45:46,852 --> 00:45:49,006
stating that my system is symmetric in

936
00:45:49,028 --> 00:45:52,366
time. When I state that momentum is

937
00:45:52,388 --> 00:45:56,274
conserved, that reduce formally to

938
00:45:56,312 --> 00:45:58,386
stating that my system is asymmetric in

939
00:45:58,408 --> 00:46:02,034
space. Okay? So most things in

940
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:04,590
physics can be framed as simply

941
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,670
symmetries over system dynamics.

942
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:13,938
And a Gold theory is simply elaborate

943
00:46:14,034 --> 00:46:17,766
instance of this core ID. So if

944
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:21,014
your symmetry has two properties first,

945
00:46:21,052 --> 00:46:25,266
it is continuous. So not like a

946
00:46:25,308 --> 00:46:27,146
set of small rotation, but like the set

947
00:46:27,168 --> 00:46:28,826
of all possible rotation that you can

948
00:46:28,848 --> 00:46:32,046
take around a circle and local. So you

949
00:46:32,068 --> 00:46:33,822
can apply the symmetry transformation to

950
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:37,454
every single point in space. Your

951
00:46:37,492 --> 00:46:39,742
problem basically can be framed with

952
00:46:39,876 --> 00:46:41,966
realm degree of freedom. So because the

953
00:46:41,988 --> 00:46:43,680
symmetry does not change your system,

954
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:47,442
whether your system where your stem is

955
00:46:47,496 --> 00:46:49,406
in the, for example, clockwork rotation.

956
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:51,106
It is not important. It does not change

957
00:46:51,128 --> 00:46:54,446
the dynamics. So this redundant degree

958
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,310
of freedom we call a gauge parameter.

959
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:03,046
The core feature of gauge theory is to

960
00:47:03,068 --> 00:47:05,334
take the geometry of that problem and

961
00:47:05,372 --> 00:47:09,734
make it into a physical force. So when

962
00:47:09,772 --> 00:47:13,754
I say gorgeous parameter, so this is you

963
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:18,790
should see in the screen nontrivial

964
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,826
z over two z possible bundle of a

965
00:47:20,848 --> 00:47:23,406
circle, which means basically that you

966
00:47:23,428 --> 00:47:26,270
have a circle, it has two stages, and

967
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,142
when you are over it, you can be either

968
00:47:28,196 --> 00:47:32,414
on top or down, and you can't know

969
00:47:32,612 --> 00:47:35,982
where it is. So this is not quite

970
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:37,314
the graph freedom because you have only

971
00:47:37,352 --> 00:47:38,638
two choices. To get to the graph

972
00:47:38,654 --> 00:47:39,934
freedom, you have to get a continuous

973
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,658
space of choices. But this is basically

974
00:47:42,744 --> 00:47:45,086
what we mean by gold parameter. It is a

975
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:47,494
geometric property of your system that

976
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,150
you know mathematically exists, but that

977
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:55,254
cannot possibly be observed or how

978
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:57,766
to say corresponds to a choice in how

979
00:47:57,788 --> 00:48:00,214
you observe your system. So this is why

980
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,974
we talk of GOJ, because this is a choice

981
00:48:02,022 --> 00:48:04,906
in how we inspire the system. But I will

982
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:08,060
not get into the details of this here.

983
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,946
And the thing is that because of its

984
00:48:11,968 --> 00:48:14,494
redundancy, the Goch parameter does not

985
00:48:14,532 --> 00:48:16,782
have to be the same in a specific

986
00:48:16,836 --> 00:48:20,640
trajectory at any given point in space.

987
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,014
And from that you get curvature.

988
00:48:24,142 --> 00:48:27,074
And curvature if you are anywhere near

989
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,820
physics and, you know.

990
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:41,374
Avil okay, last thing

991
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:43,106
we heard was if you're anywhere. In

992
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,346
physics about relativity theory, you

993
00:48:45,368 --> 00:48:47,294
will know that curve to the naive

994
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:50,766
embedding space. So if you know vaguely

995
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:54,002
about relativity. Theory yes,

996
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:55,846
sorry, just if you're anywhere in

997
00:48:55,868 --> 00:48:57,720
physics and then continue from there.

998
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:02,258
Yes. So if you are vaguely familiar

999
00:49:02,354 --> 00:49:05,606
with relativity theory, you know that

1000
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:08,490
curvature in a space, it corresponds to

1001
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,906
forces. So in relativity theory, the

1002
00:49:10,928 --> 00:49:13,510
curvature of spacetime, it corresponds

1003
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:17,898
to the gravity force. And generally in

1004
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:21,542
physics, the curvature in other weirder

1005
00:49:21,606 --> 00:49:24,682
gauge spaces, it translates in the other

1006
00:49:24,736 --> 00:49:26,426
fundamental forces. So weak force,

1007
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:30,670
strong force and electromagnetism.

1008
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:34,578
So, yes, just stating that there is a

1009
00:49:34,664 --> 00:49:38,482
space which has a gorge parameter in it

1010
00:49:38,616 --> 00:49:41,474
and this space has a curvature. It

1011
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:44,434
entails that you have a force that

1012
00:49:44,472 --> 00:49:47,154
emerges over the, let us say, natural

1013
00:49:47,202 --> 00:49:49,080
framing of the problem.

1014
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:55,122
And this speaks very closely

1015
00:49:55,186 --> 00:49:58,466
to active inference. So active inference

1016
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,458
can be framed as a consequence of a

1017
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,134
formal result that is called the frenzy

1018
00:50:02,182 --> 00:50:05,514
principle. Let us write a

1019
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:07,786
dimmical system stochastic which means

1020
00:50:07,808 --> 00:50:10,958
that it has noise in it and which can be

1021
00:50:11,044 --> 00:50:12,990
partitioned between an agent A

1022
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,566
environment B and boundary sorry, an

1023
00:50:15,588 --> 00:50:18,270
environment E and a boundary B such that

1024
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,726
the distribution of the agent and the

1025
00:50:21,748 --> 00:50:24,606
environment are independent from each

1026
00:50:24,628 --> 00:50:26,738
other given the distribution of the

1027
00:50:26,744 --> 00:50:30,034
boundary B, which kind of means that an

1028
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:33,406
information in E that is relevant

1029
00:50:33,438 --> 00:50:35,814
in A and vice versa has to be in B. But

1030
00:50:35,852 --> 00:50:38,134
doesn't quite mean that. But it's very

1031
00:50:38,172 --> 00:50:41,286
close. Then you have an information

1032
00:50:41,388 --> 00:50:45,960
geometry which is like

1033
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,710
geometrical construct where each point

1034
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,498
in the agent corresponds to its position

1035
00:50:50,524 --> 00:50:53,882
of belief over the

1036
00:50:54,016 --> 00:50:56,380
space of external states.

1037
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,766
And because of this information

1038
00:50:59,888 --> 00:51:03,194
geometry, each possible internal

1039
00:51:03,242 --> 00:51:05,834
state of the agent, it entails

1040
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,586
implicitly a belief over external

1041
00:51:08,618 --> 00:51:11,406
states. So this means that given the

1042
00:51:11,428 --> 00:51:13,570
condition of partitionability,

1043
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,794
I can write Bayesian belief over my

1044
00:51:17,832 --> 00:51:20,654
environment as a simple geometrical

1045
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:24,578
property of the space we are working

1046
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:28,470
in. And as I just said, when you have

1047
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,374
a geometry and it's curved, you get

1048
00:51:30,412 --> 00:51:35,138
forces. And so the FEP

1049
00:51:35,234 --> 00:51:38,978
can straightforwardly be framed

1050
00:51:39,074 --> 00:51:42,374
as gauge theory where

1051
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:44,454
the symmetries in sensor entropy

1052
00:51:44,502 --> 00:51:47,114
technically. But let us say the space of

1053
00:51:47,152 --> 00:51:49,654
belief I am evolving in directly

1054
00:51:49,702 --> 00:51:53,002
constrain my action in a specific manner

1055
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:55,614
to constrain biasian coherence between

1056
00:51:55,652 --> 00:51:57,646
what I expect to be the case and what I

1057
00:51:57,668 --> 00:52:00,222
experience to be the case. And so

1058
00:52:00,276 --> 00:52:01,706
straightforwardly this grounds active

1059
00:52:01,738 --> 00:52:03,938
inference because like what I just said

1060
00:52:04,024 --> 00:52:06,366
is what I said to explain active

1061
00:52:06,398 --> 00:52:08,322
inference up to some technical words

1062
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:11,346
that were added in. But yes, this result

1063
00:52:11,448 --> 00:52:13,506
entails predictive processing and

1064
00:52:13,528 --> 00:52:15,446
predictive control of behavior of the

1065
00:52:15,468 --> 00:52:18,994
agent and to some extent

1066
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:22,022
improves the possibility of this

1067
00:52:22,156 --> 00:52:26,070
existing in bare dymical system theory.

1068
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:31,242
But I do not think that the FEP can

1069
00:52:31,296 --> 00:52:33,994
possibly represent enculturation. So

1070
00:52:34,032 --> 00:52:36,394
when I talk of a dynamical system, this

1071
00:52:36,432 --> 00:52:38,522
is a system with dynamics in it. You

1072
00:52:38,576 --> 00:52:40,960
are, I think you understand that.

1073
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,834
I do not think you necessarily

1074
00:52:43,882 --> 00:52:47,034
understand the formalism that we imply

1075
00:52:47,082 --> 00:52:50,782
by it. A mixture system is a

1076
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:54,846
flow function phi, a time parameter t

1077
00:52:54,948 --> 00:52:58,354
and a state space x. So what that

1078
00:52:58,392 --> 00:53:00,386
means is that to frame an ecosystem, I

1079
00:53:00,408 --> 00:53:02,786
have to write a space, let us say, I

1080
00:53:02,808 --> 00:53:05,038
don't know, just the Euclidean space

1081
00:53:05,144 --> 00:53:08,578
with three dimension. I have to specify

1082
00:53:08,674 --> 00:53:11,606
time, which is like naturally in the

1083
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:14,134
occurrence space what we think of as

1084
00:53:14,172 --> 00:53:17,206
time. And I have to specify a specific

1085
00:53:17,308 --> 00:53:21,354
way in which my system will move in

1086
00:53:21,392 --> 00:53:25,286
space in a given step of time. So fear

1087
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:27,194
gives from any position and any time

1088
00:53:27,232 --> 00:53:30,006
slot where the system will be if it

1089
00:53:30,048 --> 00:53:31,806
starts from this position after the

1090
00:53:31,828 --> 00:53:35,886
specific time duration. This is

1091
00:53:35,908 --> 00:53:39,326
what a unimical system is. But if you

1092
00:53:39,348 --> 00:53:41,950
have noticed this,

1093
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,118
this entails that I define preemptively

1094
00:53:45,294 --> 00:53:47,794
all other space of possibilities of my

1095
00:53:47,832 --> 00:53:51,460
system. If I have a system that is

1096
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:54,674
open ended system of constraints, that

1097
00:53:54,712 --> 00:53:56,086
can build new stuff, that can build

1098
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:59,138
language, that can build accounting,

1099
00:53:59,234 --> 00:54:02,360
whatever new states this doesn't go,

1100
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,798
maybe you say we could reconstruct a

1101
00:54:05,804 --> 00:54:08,934
minimal notion of new stuff happening by

1102
00:54:08,972 --> 00:54:09,560
working.

1103
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,120
Sorry, I'll ask him again,

1104
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:22,406
Avel again repeat the last

1105
00:54:22,428 --> 00:54:23,430
30 seconds,

1106
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,016
but your audio is still not there. It's

1107
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:32,524
like a 30 to 42nd period where

1108
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:34,808
your audio just doesn't transmit. None

1109
00:54:34,824 --> 00:54:37,884
of us can hear it. But the Internet is

1110
00:54:37,922 --> 00:54:41,496
fine. Working over the dynamics

1111
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,828
of the system per se, learning the

1112
00:54:42,834 --> 00:54:44,336
mechanical system theory. So you can do

1113
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:48,210
that either. Fine. Yeah. Continue.

1114
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,730
Yes, continue. Okay.

1115
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,676
So the mixture system can be written as

1116
00:54:56,698 --> 00:55:00,260
a flow function phi over a state space x

1117
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,870
and a time parameter t.

1118
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,600
When you specify x you specify the total

1119
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,904
space of possibility of the system. So

1120
00:55:08,942 --> 00:55:10,456
if you have a system that has opened any

1121
00:55:10,478 --> 00:55:13,720
evolution in it well, you cannot work

1122
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:17,150
with a fixed space. You could maybe

1123
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,888
circumvent the issue by implicitly

1124
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,972
having new things happen from a change

1125
00:55:23,026 --> 00:55:25,804
in the dynamics of the system. But in

1126
00:55:25,842 --> 00:55:27,564
Mikel system theory the dynamics are

1127
00:55:27,602 --> 00:55:29,660
pregiven through the flow function

1128
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:34,252
phiical system

1129
00:55:34,306 --> 00:55:37,040
theory. System is a specific

1130
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:39,392
deterministic flow. So you can't change

1131
00:55:39,446 --> 00:55:41,520
the flow through time so you can't model

1132
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:44,164
the construction of new constraints and

1133
00:55:44,202 --> 00:55:45,876
you can't model the emergence of new

1134
00:55:45,898 --> 00:55:47,908
parameters that affect causality of

1135
00:55:47,914 --> 00:55:51,344
system. So the FEP in of itself cannot

1136
00:55:51,392 --> 00:55:53,540
present the creative evolution of either

1137
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,784
cognitive kinds such as money shares or

1138
00:55:57,902 --> 00:56:03,176
constraints. And this

1139
00:56:03,198 --> 00:56:06,740
is where we have to get in weirder

1140
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,304
spaces formally to get something that

1141
00:56:09,342 --> 00:56:10,956
looks like it could model open end

1142
00:56:10,978 --> 00:56:12,284
evolution although I cannot say

1143
00:56:12,322 --> 00:56:13,944
definitively it can because we didn't

1144
00:56:13,992 --> 00:56:17,388
yet by construction. When we work with

1145
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,756
set theory which is the basic theory of

1146
00:56:19,778 --> 00:56:22,236
mathematics which is about specific

1147
00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:24,924
objects that are predefined we can't

1148
00:56:24,972 --> 00:56:28,076
have what Kaufman calls adjacent

1149
00:56:28,108 --> 00:56:30,416
possible which correspond to new

1150
00:56:30,518 --> 00:56:33,204
evolutionary possibilities that are

1151
00:56:33,242 --> 00:56:35,396
brought about by the evolution upon an

1152
00:56:35,418 --> 00:56:38,244
evolution of evolutionary system like

1153
00:56:38,282 --> 00:56:39,460
living systems.

1154
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,384
Simply, set theory forces you to define

1155
00:56:44,432 --> 00:56:46,788
all of the possibilities at step one of

1156
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:49,176
the modeling process so can't have your

1157
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:51,572
system that builds new possibilities

1158
00:56:51,636 --> 00:56:54,376
through its activity. This is not a

1159
00:56:54,398 --> 00:56:56,768
coherent concept in set theory.

1160
00:56:56,964 --> 00:57:00,268
However. What we can do is to look at,

1161
00:57:00,354 --> 00:57:03,032
rather than set theory at a category

1162
00:57:03,096 --> 00:57:06,108
theory which is, let us say, another

1163
00:57:06,194 --> 00:57:08,764
approach to mathematic which looks not

1164
00:57:08,802 --> 00:57:11,068
at specific objects and their

1165
00:57:11,154 --> 00:57:13,288
relationship to functions but at

1166
00:57:13,314 --> 00:57:15,436
specific spaces and their relationships

1167
00:57:15,468 --> 00:57:18,656
to functions. And this change in

1168
00:57:18,678 --> 00:57:21,456
approach basically does not entail, at

1169
00:57:21,478 --> 00:57:24,116
least not a priory that when you write a

1170
00:57:24,138 --> 00:57:25,796
system you have to write all of the

1171
00:57:25,818 --> 00:57:27,572
possibilities that are within the system

1172
00:57:27,626 --> 00:57:30,484
preemptively. You can write a space and

1173
00:57:30,522 --> 00:57:33,300
then look at the relationship between

1174
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:36,744
the space and other adjacent spaces that

1175
00:57:36,782 --> 00:57:38,840
could correspond to adjacent possibles.

1176
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,744
And one thing that is related to

1177
00:57:42,782 --> 00:57:47,036
that, at least in spirit is I

1178
00:57:47,058 --> 00:57:48,744
won't get into detail but formal

1179
00:57:48,792 --> 00:57:50,492
approaches that allow you to build

1180
00:57:50,546 --> 00:57:53,084
quantum state spaces from the property

1181
00:57:53,202 --> 00:57:56,316
of quantum observation rather than the

1182
00:57:56,338 --> 00:57:59,552
opposite. So simply speaking, we can

1183
00:57:59,606 --> 00:58:02,204
look at the problem of how cognition

1184
00:58:02,252 --> 00:58:04,864
brings about new possible not as a space

1185
00:58:04,902 --> 00:58:06,976
of possibilities in which there is a

1186
00:58:06,998 --> 00:58:11,320
flow but as a set of spaces

1187
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,340
in which specific events such as

1188
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:16,720
observation, such as enculturation,

1189
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,164
such as invention of new concepts can

1190
00:58:20,282 --> 00:58:23,824
bring about new spaces. And when we

1191
00:58:23,882 --> 00:58:25,924
rewrite active inference in the language

1192
00:58:25,972 --> 00:58:30,744
of category theory we get things that

1193
00:58:30,782 --> 00:58:32,744
do not quite say the same thing as

1194
00:58:32,782 --> 00:58:35,370
immaculate system theory like actual

1195
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,556
active inference, actual frenzy

1196
00:58:37,588 --> 00:58:40,844
principle but we get things that are

1197
00:58:40,882 --> 00:58:42,744
very very complicated. So the diagram

1198
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:44,236
that you see on the bottom left of the

1199
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:47,676
screen is a conecocone diagram. I could

1200
00:58:47,698 --> 00:58:49,616
tell you what a concoction is but I

1201
00:58:49,638 --> 00:58:51,936
don't know. So I could not explain that

1202
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:54,096
is meant to represent the alignment in

1203
00:58:54,118 --> 00:58:56,428
reference frame or the mutual active

1204
00:58:56,444 --> 00:58:58,560
inference between two subsystem.

1205
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,528
So again, formally we have no reason to

1206
00:59:02,534 --> 00:59:04,748
believe this can't model upon evolution.

1207
00:59:04,924 --> 00:59:07,128
But also given the level of effectness

1208
00:59:07,164 --> 00:59:09,280
of the math, we have very very few grip

1209
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,208
with which to understand what we're

1210
00:59:12,224 --> 00:59:13,956
looking at and how this relate to

1211
00:59:13,978 --> 00:59:15,476
specific cognitive and cultural

1212
00:59:15,508 --> 00:59:18,244
processes. So there is a lot of progress

1213
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:20,216
to be made in that direction before we

1214
00:59:20,238 --> 00:59:21,832
have a self standing theory of open

1215
00:59:21,886 --> 00:59:26,248
ending cultural evolution and the

1216
00:59:26,334 --> 00:59:28,524
basic handle of social constraints I

1217
00:59:28,562 --> 00:59:31,292
think is a good bridge between the very

1218
00:59:31,346 --> 00:59:33,288
concrete, very simple the immigrant

1219
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:36,060
system theory and the very abstract

1220
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,264
problem of many evolution. So let us

1221
00:59:41,302 --> 00:59:45,376
wrap this up here and try to take out

1222
00:59:45,478 --> 00:59:48,880
a few snippets of actionable information

1223
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,490
that was included in the talk.

1224
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,644
First, agents by nature they

1225
00:59:56,682 --> 00:59:58,852
engage with the world with their world

1226
00:59:58,986 --> 01:00:01,936
as a cognitive landscape that is defined

1227
01:00:01,968 --> 01:00:03,776
by the modalities by which they perceive

1228
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,844
the world, that is defined by the

1229
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:07,640
intrinsic themativity that the agent

1230
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:10,650
experience and that is.

1231
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:27,014
Again sorry, just go back 22

1232
01:00:27,052 --> 01:00:30,950
seconds but

1233
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,726
still the audio is not ready yet. But

1234
01:00:32,748 --> 01:00:35,666
it's okay, we'll breathe before we jump

1235
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:36,950
into the conclusion.

1236
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:48,370
It okay.

1237
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,330
Still don't hear you.

1238
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:06,920
No,

1239
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,424
we can do the slide game where someone

1240
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:27,104
else presents the slide. Any volunteers?

1241
01:01:27,152 --> 01:01:30,228
Okay. Yeah, I heard that. Okay,

1242
01:01:30,314 --> 01:01:32,308
cool. Can you please continue? No.

1243
01:01:32,474 --> 01:01:34,644
Okay, we'll try to go fast because this

1244
01:01:34,682 --> 01:01:38,550
is not agreeable. So one,

1245
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,936
agents engage with the world as a

1246
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,616
cognitive landscape which is defined by

1247
01:01:42,638 --> 01:01:44,452
affordencies so minimal representation

1248
01:01:44,516 --> 01:01:47,656
of the action that are possible in the

1249
01:01:47,678 --> 01:01:50,048
landscape and the normativity that's

1250
01:01:50,084 --> 01:01:51,708
embedded in the possibility of the

1251
01:01:51,714 --> 01:01:54,952
action. Two, the fact that humans

1252
01:01:55,016 --> 01:01:57,256
collectively enact relatively coherent

1253
01:01:57,288 --> 01:01:59,884
circular landscape. It entails that we

1254
01:01:59,922 --> 01:02:02,584
have social constraints over collective

1255
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:04,796
behavior and the existence of those

1256
01:02:04,818 --> 01:02:06,656
social constraints they enable or

1257
01:02:06,678 --> 01:02:08,876
thought do not necessitate the emergence

1258
01:02:08,908 --> 01:02:10,752
of higher scale agencies such as

1259
01:02:10,806 --> 01:02:13,410
institution, organization and maybe

1260
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,680
godlike beings.

1261
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,444
And last, the dynamics of constraints,

1262
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:22,228
they entail a duality between the

1263
01:02:22,234 --> 01:02:23,956
creation of meaning. So the way we

1264
01:02:24,058 --> 01:02:26,836
humans create a way to understand the

1265
01:02:26,858 --> 01:02:30,940
world and the conception of physicals

1266
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,508
in the sense specific, concrete,

1267
01:02:33,604 --> 01:02:36,584
causally relevant possibilities that

1268
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:38,356
characterize specific social cultural

1269
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:40,884
organizations and maybe like physical

1270
01:02:40,932 --> 01:02:43,128
version paratuses but just don't worry

1271
01:02:43,144 --> 01:02:47,096
about it. And all of it is embedded

1272
01:02:47,128 --> 01:02:50,076
in this diagram the engagement and the

1273
01:02:50,098 --> 01:02:52,472
duality with a system of constraints

1274
01:02:52,616 --> 01:02:55,120
that produce itself in a pen in manner.

1275
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:58,240
So a claim that I'm making on the record

1276
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,812
here is that if we understand correctly

1277
01:03:00,876 --> 01:03:02,864
every arrow in this diagram. We

1278
01:03:02,902 --> 01:03:04,416
understand culture evolution, we

1279
01:03:04,438 --> 01:03:06,128
understand what human are, and we

1280
01:03:06,134 --> 01:03:08,240
understand opening evolution in the

1281
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:11,476
cultural world. And here I'll go through

1282
01:03:11,498 --> 01:03:13,748
the slides in case someone needs a

1283
01:03:13,754 --> 01:03:15,796
reference and has the time to go through

1284
01:03:15,818 --> 01:03:19,304
the video to find the reference. So,

1285
01:03:19,342 --> 01:03:21,924
thank you. And sorry about the audio

1286
01:03:21,972 --> 01:03:22,570
thing.

1287
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,970
Did this go well?

1288
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:32,952
Yes, it gave some much needed silences,

1289
01:03:33,016 --> 01:03:36,236
so it was all good. Cool.

1290
01:03:36,418 --> 01:03:40,024
Well, first, Mao or Maria,

1291
01:03:40,152 --> 01:03:42,404
if you would like to give any comments

1292
01:03:42,472 --> 01:03:45,696
or reflections. Otherwise we can go

1293
01:03:45,718 --> 01:03:48,816
to a few topics and then talk about how

1294
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:51,890
we want to conclude with the course.

1295
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,600
But first, Mao or Maria, do you want to

1296
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:58,070
say or ask anything?

1297
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:05,810
No. I mean, this was a great summary.

1298
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:09,814
I think you covered a lot of grounds. I

1299
01:04:09,852 --> 01:04:12,262
think, ideally, I would have liked to

1300
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:16,486
see how

1301
01:04:16,508 --> 01:04:20,342
much we can do with gauge theory and

1302
01:04:20,396 --> 01:04:24,090
how this can potentially link us

1303
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,534
to understandings

1304
01:04:28,582 --> 01:04:31,626
of would be that would be

1305
01:04:31,648 --> 01:04:32,220
interesting.

1306
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,780
Cool. Thank you, Maria. All right.

1307
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:47,964
See you, Maria. Okay. Anyone in live

1308
01:04:48,002 --> 01:04:53,484
chat can ask a question or let's

1309
01:04:53,532 --> 01:04:55,952
first address the course question while

1310
01:04:56,006 --> 01:04:57,724
people are writing questions. Live chat.

1311
01:04:57,772 --> 01:05:02,160
So what do you see for the coming weeks

1312
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:05,680
as we kind of conclude this first round?

1313
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,670
So you're asking me right.

1314
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,100
So, for a reason I do not understand,

1315
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:19,096
and Daniel understands, no one came up

1316
01:05:19,118 --> 01:05:21,624
at the Mao discussion session. So I

1317
01:05:21,662 --> 01:05:23,876
thought it would be interesting to push

1318
01:05:23,908 --> 01:05:25,656
a presentation for the last session to

1319
01:05:25,678 --> 01:05:27,416
have everyone saying that things have

1320
01:05:27,438 --> 01:05:31,400
feedback and I have a current thing

1321
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:34,860
to move on from. The question is whether

1322
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:36,556
you feel there is a need for a

1323
01:05:36,578 --> 01:05:38,604
discussion that is specific for the

1324
01:05:38,642 --> 01:05:41,932
session we have had just now, because

1325
01:05:41,986 --> 01:05:44,512
lots of things were covered, lots of

1326
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:47,360
audio problems were existing.

1327
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,400
And basically the two options are either

1328
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:52,976
next session is everyone presents, we

1329
01:05:52,998 --> 01:05:56,112
give you feedback ciao, or we have a

1330
01:05:56,166 --> 01:05:58,416
discussion session. So at the time that

1331
01:05:58,438 --> 01:05:59,616
was initially planned for the

1332
01:05:59,638 --> 01:06:01,860
conclusion, and then we have yet another

1333
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:03,264
session that will be the conclusion

1334
01:06:03,312 --> 01:06:04,708
where you will make a presentation and

1335
01:06:04,714 --> 01:06:06,836
you will get the feedback. So we'd like

1336
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:08,624
to know which is your preference,

1337
01:06:08,752 --> 01:06:11,364
because both are very possible in my

1338
01:06:11,402 --> 01:06:14,904
book, but doesn't show anything to me.

1339
01:06:14,942 --> 01:06:16,680
So what you want is goals.

1340
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,804
Yeah. Mao also open to your thoughts.

1341
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,616
And of course, we're sharing it so that

1342
01:06:22,638 --> 01:06:24,476
people can write in live chat or let us

1343
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:25,644
know in the coming days what they

1344
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:29,064
prefer. I'm down for a discussion

1345
01:06:29,112 --> 01:06:31,592
of what we covered here. The slides

1346
01:06:31,656 --> 01:06:33,008
being linked and going into some of

1347
01:06:33,014 --> 01:06:36,290
these next steps, and then a form based

1348
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:40,544
registration for a presentation only

1349
01:06:40,662 --> 01:06:43,008
session so that we'll then know exactly

1350
01:06:43,094 --> 01:06:45,488
who wants to present what. And then we

1351
01:06:45,494 --> 01:06:46,868
can ask how many minutes they want to

1352
01:06:46,874 --> 01:06:48,660
do, or something like that. But mao?

1353
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,244
Yeah, I think it would be good to get

1354
01:06:54,282 --> 01:06:56,612
people who are interested in getting

1355
01:06:56,666 --> 01:07:00,024
more active to come and make

1356
01:07:00,062 --> 01:07:02,824
a small presentation, explain what they

1357
01:07:02,862 --> 01:07:06,644
understood, describe the highlights

1358
01:07:06,692 --> 01:07:09,784
for them, and potentially link it to

1359
01:07:09,902 --> 01:07:11,996
some topic in social sciences we may not

1360
01:07:12,018 --> 01:07:15,244
have covered here, but that they

1361
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:16,988
now see through a different lens. I

1362
01:07:16,994 --> 01:07:18,270
think that would be interesting.

1363
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:29,104
Okay. All right. I will look

1364
01:07:29,142 --> 01:07:31,208
through the live chat while avoid

1365
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:32,564
getting some water, and then we'll ask

1366
01:07:32,602 --> 01:07:35,270
any questions that people come up with.

1367
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,900
Is there ever symmetric information

1368
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,490
between or among social entities?

1369
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:56,194
Or maybe from the scripts perspective,

1370
01:07:56,242 --> 01:07:59,346
mao or from the or however you see

1371
01:07:59,388 --> 01:08:00,746
in relation with the constraints? I

1372
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:04,410
mean, what about asymmetric constraints?

1373
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:07,434
I'm not sure I understand the question.

1374
01:08:07,552 --> 01:08:10,586
Can the person give a little more detail

1375
01:08:10,688 --> 01:08:13,360
in terms of in the questions? Okay,

1376
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,526
evil is back. But there was a question

1377
01:08:16,548 --> 01:08:20,062
in the chat about can information ever

1378
01:08:20,116 --> 01:08:22,434
be symmetric? You talked about

1379
01:08:22,472 --> 01:08:26,562
symmetries. So are those symmetries in

1380
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:30,110
the information that two social entities

1381
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,494
have, or are they in the constraints

1382
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:35,654
that entities experience? But what are

1383
01:08:35,692 --> 01:08:38,630
the symmetries and what are the breaks?

1384
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:43,590
I would say that depending which space

1385
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:47,218
you model the problem information, it

1386
01:08:47,244 --> 01:08:50,506
entails symmetry because it

1387
01:08:50,528 --> 01:08:52,858
has to be readable. So you have to be a

1388
01:08:52,864 --> 01:08:56,746
conservation between context or time of

1389
01:08:56,848 --> 01:08:59,306
something that is considered to be the

1390
01:08:59,328 --> 01:09:02,586
content of the information bearing

1391
01:09:02,698 --> 01:09:05,706
thing. But also it is a symmetry

1392
01:09:05,738 --> 01:09:08,960
breaking because if you take any

1393
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:11,194
presentation format, let's say binary,

1394
01:09:11,242 --> 01:09:13,694
a random string means nothing, and you

1395
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:15,358
have to break the symmetry of the

1396
01:09:15,364 --> 01:09:18,306
uniform expression to say something. So

1397
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:20,402
it depends very heavily on how

1398
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:21,826
specifically you are modeling the

1399
01:09:21,848 --> 01:09:25,166
problem. But for fundamental reasons,

1400
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:27,714
any mathematical representation, it

1401
01:09:27,752 --> 01:09:30,086
depends on the implicit model of the

1402
01:09:30,108 --> 01:09:31,686
symmetries of the system because you

1403
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:33,414
won't present things that do not matter,

1404
01:09:33,532 --> 01:09:35,334
but you have to present things that do

1405
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:38,940
matter, and then you have a very

1406
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:42,986
uncomfortable amount of freedom over how

1407
01:09:43,008 --> 01:09:45,100
you want to present any single thing.

1408
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:52,662
Certainly this comes up in learning

1409
01:09:52,736 --> 01:09:54,894
active inference and in talking about it

1410
01:09:54,932 --> 01:09:56,382
like what you described, how many ways

1411
01:09:56,436 --> 01:09:58,974
there are to model a given thing which

1412
01:09:59,012 --> 01:10:01,566
is related to which symmetries are

1413
01:10:01,588 --> 01:10:05,666
preserved, as you mentioned. So how do

1414
01:10:05,688 --> 01:10:08,610
we reckon with that space and with the

1415
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,114
different ways of representing the

1416
01:10:12,152 --> 01:10:14,930
same social setting?

1417
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:19,590
So a reason why I'm not quite

1418
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:22,566
comfortable with the notion of

1419
01:10:22,588 --> 01:10:26,118
information is that in all

1420
01:10:26,204 --> 01:10:29,638
possible settings where I define quantum

1421
01:10:29,654 --> 01:10:31,018
information theory as not possible

1422
01:10:31,104 --> 01:10:33,434
because very few people overall think

1423
01:10:33,472 --> 01:10:35,578
about it, information will be a

1424
01:10:35,584 --> 01:10:37,130
probability distribution. It will be

1425
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,982
like functional over probability

1426
01:10:39,046 --> 01:10:41,422
submission that is minus to the

1427
01:10:41,476 --> 01:10:43,694
logarithm of the probability. That is

1428
01:10:43,732 --> 01:10:48,174
what self information is. And this

1429
01:10:48,212 --> 01:10:49,770
is defined over a probability

1430
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:52,106
distribution. Distribution is defined

1431
01:10:52,138 --> 01:10:54,586
over state space. So implicitly

1432
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:56,514
information entails differential state

1433
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,610
space. So if you want to work over

1434
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,294
things that are prior to state spaces,

1435
01:11:01,422 --> 01:11:05,330
you cannot work with information in any

1436
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,010
coherent definition.

1437
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:15,334
Basically, the one thing you

1438
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:18,422
could do that is vaguely inspired from

1439
01:11:18,476 --> 01:11:20,374
work in quantum information theory,

1440
01:11:20,422 --> 01:11:23,642
mainly by Christopher first is to not

1441
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,074
look at the probability, but at the

1442
01:11:26,272 --> 01:11:28,378
sorry, not to look at the information.

1443
01:11:28,544 --> 01:11:30,842
I'm using that term in a colloquial way

1444
01:11:30,896 --> 01:11:33,210
now because I have to switch meaning

1445
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:37,294
information not as a property of the

1446
01:11:37,332 --> 01:11:40,714
dispersion but as a property of quantum

1447
01:11:40,842 --> 01:11:43,998
operator that corresponds to observation

1448
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:47,042
and that embeds. Basically, we could say

1449
01:11:47,096 --> 01:11:49,042
again, in a very, very colloquial sense,

1450
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:51,186
something akin to an expectation or a

1451
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:54,900
measurement or a synchronization event

1452
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:59,320
in the active inference model. And this

1453
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:02,550
for a specific type of operator,

1454
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:06,742
for a specific type of spaces, you can

1455
01:12:06,796 --> 01:12:09,386
get basically the space that flows from

1456
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:11,354
the operator rather than the other way

1457
01:12:11,392 --> 01:12:15,914
around. And then information is like

1458
01:12:15,952 --> 01:12:18,406
it's not colmogo rough complexity, it's

1459
01:12:18,438 --> 01:12:20,686
not shaman information, it's not a

1460
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:23,374
variant of entropy. It is basically what

1461
01:12:23,412 --> 01:12:25,502
is hypothesized by these specific

1462
01:12:25,636 --> 01:12:27,726
operators that you use to interact with

1463
01:12:27,748 --> 01:12:29,706
matter and with cultural and material

1464
01:12:29,738 --> 01:12:32,834
environments. And maybe there is a big

1465
01:12:32,872 --> 01:12:34,914
maybe here, I should say maybe one more

1466
01:12:34,952 --> 01:12:37,922
time. Maybe this can adapt it in some

1467
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:41,202
way to account for the process

1468
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:45,650
of ankuration, where basically

1469
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,374
the process angulation is considered as

1470
01:12:48,412 --> 01:12:50,674
the integration of specific reference

1471
01:12:50,722 --> 01:12:53,750
frames, like expectation colloquially.

1472
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:57,910
And this entail

1473
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:59,942
the evolution of the cognitive landscape

1474
01:13:00,006 --> 01:13:03,290
and our social constraints either

1475
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,962
defined over the cognitive landscape or

1476
01:13:06,016 --> 01:13:08,646
defined as a self standing mathematical

1477
01:13:08,678 --> 01:13:12,174
object, I do not know. But if we have

1478
01:13:12,212 --> 01:13:15,950
that, and if we have a decent

1479
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:18,062
level of understanding of what

1480
01:13:18,116 --> 01:13:20,586
constraints the evolution of neurofence

1481
01:13:20,618 --> 01:13:23,562
frames, we have a selfcending theory of

1482
01:13:23,636 --> 01:13:25,426
the unfolding of creative landscapes and

1483
01:13:25,448 --> 01:13:27,266
of open ended culture evolution. This is

1484
01:13:27,288 --> 01:13:28,706
a sufficient condition, I am sure of

1485
01:13:28,728 --> 01:13:31,540
that. But it is very hard to reach.

1486
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:37,046
There are so many threads by which you

1487
01:13:37,068 --> 01:13:39,814
could take it and each one is like the

1488
01:13:39,852 --> 01:13:42,386
level of postdoc in mathematics. And I'm

1489
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,626
not talking about 19th century

1490
01:13:44,658 --> 01:13:46,418
mathematics, but talking about algebraic

1491
01:13:46,434 --> 01:13:48,402
topology. I'm talking about weird

1492
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:50,566
category thing that people only figured

1493
01:13:50,598 --> 01:13:53,002
out how to define 30 years ago. So yeah,

1494
01:13:53,056 --> 01:13:54,986
I'm not confident I will give you an

1495
01:13:55,008 --> 01:13:56,838
answer to that within five years. I'm

1496
01:13:56,854 --> 01:13:57,770
not confident.

1497
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:03,534
Wow, very interesting there. All right,

1498
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,400
some questions from the chat. So, first

1499
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:10,800
upcycle, Club wrote do you think

1500
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:14,242
ritualized storytelling is driven by

1501
01:14:14,296 --> 01:14:17,726
social constraints? Everything is driven

1502
01:14:17,758 --> 01:14:19,246
by circumstraints. We just define

1503
01:14:19,278 --> 01:14:20,946
circumstraints as the contrast that

1504
01:14:20,968 --> 01:14:24,530
exist over behavior. If we

1505
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,118
expect that every night we have to go

1506
01:14:27,144 --> 01:14:30,502
around the fire and listen to someone

1507
01:14:30,556 --> 01:14:32,854
tell a story, then yeah, this will

1508
01:14:32,892 --> 01:14:34,726
happen. If we expect that we have to go

1509
01:14:34,748 --> 01:14:37,506
on YouTube and listen to talks about

1510
01:14:37,628 --> 01:14:39,706
abstract things such as inference, this

1511
01:14:39,728 --> 01:14:42,122
will happen. So in this sense,

1512
01:14:42,176 --> 01:14:43,866
everything, every single activity you

1513
01:14:43,888 --> 01:14:46,586
have is embedded in landscape or

1514
01:14:46,608 --> 01:14:48,922
cultural expectation. And this is why

1515
01:14:48,976 --> 01:14:51,066
it's pretty hard to talk about basic

1516
01:14:51,098 --> 01:14:52,554
mechanism of cultural transmission

1517
01:14:52,602 --> 01:14:54,394
because whichever cognitive mechanism

1518
01:14:54,442 --> 01:14:57,214
you are looking at is encultured and

1519
01:14:57,252 --> 01:14:59,598
could in principle and likely has been a

1520
01:14:59,604 --> 01:15:02,590
few times changed by cultural evolution.

1521
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:08,082
Yes. Cool.

1522
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:11,010
And that takes me back to the scripts

1523
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:14,238
discussion in papers, the strong script

1524
01:15:14,334 --> 01:15:17,458
at exactly this time here's the script

1525
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:20,662
that we're all going to read from on

1526
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:23,538
through the spaces of weaker scripts

1527
01:15:23,554 --> 01:15:25,254
like we tend to meet here or there

1528
01:15:25,292 --> 01:15:28,922
happens to be a path here. Okay. So then

1529
01:15:28,976 --> 01:15:32,620
some comments from M. Lenin. One,

1530
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:35,626
thank you. I don't know if making a

1531
01:15:35,648 --> 01:15:37,962
presentation to explain what one

1532
01:15:38,016 --> 01:15:40,410
understood is an attractive invitation.

1533
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:43,214
Still, two places I did not track as

1534
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:46,702
well as I hope was. One, dissolution of

1535
01:15:46,756 --> 01:15:50,126
agency as we know it and two,

1536
01:15:50,308 --> 01:15:53,618
the informational geometry among agent,

1537
01:15:53,704 --> 01:15:55,746
environment and boundary went over my

1538
01:15:55,768 --> 01:15:56,820
head. Thank you.

1539
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:03,360
So dissolution of agency and agent,

1540
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:06,836
environment, boundary. Yes. I will

1541
01:16:06,858 --> 01:16:10,276
get back to the slides. Are you

1542
01:16:10,298 --> 01:16:11,380
seeing the window?

1543
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,924
Yeah, I'll bring it in. That's fine.

1544
01:16:17,962 --> 01:16:21,190
Thank you. Okay.

1545
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:29,210
So the dissolution of agency is

1546
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:34,536
basically the idea that when

1547
01:16:34,558 --> 01:16:37,404
we think about agents, people like we

1548
01:16:37,442 --> 01:16:40,124
think as a system that has a body and

1549
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:41,836
that has a brain and that has the

1550
01:16:41,858 --> 01:16:43,996
ability for discursion, like

1551
01:16:44,098 --> 01:16:45,984
deliberating over what you do and not

1552
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:49,664
do. And we place agency at the level of

1553
01:16:49,862 --> 01:16:53,376
discursive beliefs. So if I say I

1554
01:16:53,398 --> 01:16:54,768
want to grab the water and I grab the

1555
01:16:54,774 --> 01:16:56,836
water, I grab the water out of my

1556
01:16:56,858 --> 01:16:59,888
agency, if I inadvertently, I don't

1557
01:16:59,904 --> 01:17:01,476
know, bump into something and make it

1558
01:17:01,498 --> 01:17:03,588
fall or grab without thinking about it,

1559
01:17:03,754 --> 01:17:07,652
is it attentive? Most people

1560
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,064
would say yes. But that's actually not

1561
01:17:09,102 --> 01:17:10,776
entailed by the most used model of

1562
01:17:10,798 --> 01:17:13,528
agency. Legally speaking,

1563
01:17:13,614 --> 01:17:17,960
you are held as not responsible

1564
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:20,296
or less responsible of things that you

1565
01:17:20,318 --> 01:17:22,416
did not have the opportunity to debate

1566
01:17:22,468 --> 01:17:25,912
over. But from a purely cognitive

1567
01:17:25,976 --> 01:17:27,976
perspective and if the active inference

1568
01:17:28,008 --> 01:17:31,324
model is correct, the bulk of the

1569
01:17:31,362 --> 01:17:33,304
intentionality of your ability to direct

1570
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:35,424
your own flow that you have does not

1571
01:17:35,462 --> 01:17:39,010
come from reasoning and deliberation and

1572
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:43,004
central executive system like cognitive

1573
01:17:43,052 --> 01:17:44,304
function that we associate with

1574
01:17:44,342 --> 01:17:47,844
reasoning and agency. It comes from

1575
01:17:47,882 --> 01:17:50,308
the basic expectation you have yourself

1576
01:17:50,394 --> 01:17:53,456
and the world because your expectation

1577
01:17:53,488 --> 01:17:56,592
over the world constraint heavily

1578
01:17:56,736 --> 01:17:59,604
implicate the opportunities for action

1579
01:17:59,652 --> 01:18:02,344
that you perceive and your beliefs over

1580
01:18:02,382 --> 01:18:06,264
yourself constrain just as heavily the

1581
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:08,600
options that you will end up pursuing.

1582
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:12,392
And so the agency, your ability

1583
01:18:12,456 --> 01:18:16,616
to decide of stuff, it mostly

1584
01:18:16,648 --> 01:18:18,716
reduces to predictive process over your

1585
01:18:18,738 --> 01:18:21,724
self model and your world model. And

1586
01:18:21,762 --> 01:18:25,116
this is while not like I don't

1587
01:18:25,148 --> 01:18:27,532
see any problem formally or empirically

1588
01:18:27,596 --> 01:18:29,936
with that picture as I understand it,

1589
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:33,408
that comes very well for the

1590
01:18:33,574 --> 01:18:35,964
neuropsychiatric and psychological

1591
01:18:36,012 --> 01:18:38,188
literature and sociological literature.

1592
01:18:38,284 --> 01:18:39,468
Like this is good, this works

1593
01:18:39,494 --> 01:18:40,868
scientifically, but this is

1594
01:18:40,874 --> 01:18:43,124
counterintuitive because again, most

1595
01:18:43,162 --> 01:18:45,424
people will expect you to have reasoning

1596
01:18:45,472 --> 01:18:47,076
and then to decide of stuff and then to

1597
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:49,508
execute all the stuff you decide. Which

1598
01:18:49,674 --> 01:18:51,990
again, I don't think this happens.

1599
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,544
So harder question is the information

1600
01:18:55,662 --> 01:18:57,656
geometry, I kind of glossed over it

1601
01:18:57,678 --> 01:19:01,390
because yeah.

1602
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,036
So the. Information geometry is a

1603
01:19:05,058 --> 01:19:07,404
geometry that is defined within his

1604
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:08,796
incode system, equipped with a

1605
01:19:08,818 --> 01:19:11,596
partition, blah, blah, blah. And so by a

1606
01:19:11,618 --> 01:19:16,610
geometry, I mean basically a space of

1607
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:19,884
curvature that exists over your bezel

1608
01:19:19,932 --> 01:19:21,696
space. This is basically the same thing

1609
01:19:21,718 --> 01:19:25,552
that I'm presenting in the bottom left

1610
01:19:25,606 --> 01:19:27,600
of the screen. Here you have a space

1611
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:29,716
that is your normal space, where you see

1612
01:19:29,738 --> 01:19:31,604
stuff happen, which is represented here

1613
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:34,576
by the line. And you have a curvature

1614
01:19:34,688 --> 01:19:37,060
that is defined by some of the things

1615
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:40,200
that are defined over the space and by

1616
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:43,224
the Frenzy principle. When you have this

1617
01:19:43,262 --> 01:19:45,240
partition condition that is verified,

1618
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:50,472
then each

1619
01:19:50,526 --> 01:19:54,940
state in the agent internal states,

1620
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:57,068
like each specific point, it can be

1621
01:19:57,154 --> 01:19:59,016
corresponds to a belief distribution

1622
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:02,540
over the states of the environment.

1623
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,388
And so this is in this sense that we

1624
01:20:05,394 --> 01:20:07,536
have an information geometry like we

1625
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:09,264
have a geometry. So curvature over

1626
01:20:09,302 --> 01:20:12,156
space, where the space is the internal

1627
01:20:12,188 --> 01:20:14,224
state of the agent, and the geometry is

1628
01:20:14,262 --> 01:20:17,750
belief over ethical states. And

1629
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:23,556
furthermore, this matters because the

1630
01:20:23,578 --> 01:20:26,388
agent isn't actually constrained by the

1631
01:20:26,394 --> 01:20:30,810
image. The agent is

1632
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:34,324
effectively constrained by the geometry

1633
01:20:34,372 --> 01:20:38,120
in such a way that its internal flow

1634
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,860
optimizes the bias and coherence of the

1635
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:45,596
belief that exists according to the

1636
01:20:45,618 --> 01:20:49,100
geometry. So this is highly

1637
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,088
math, this is straightforward, but lots

1638
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:57,280
of words, lots of section. No real

1639
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:59,632
visual aid, put it. So this is more

1640
01:20:59,686 --> 01:21:02,576
something to read about and something to

1641
01:21:02,678 --> 01:21:04,752
hear about, which is why I glossed over

1642
01:21:04,806 --> 01:21:07,140
it. But I hope going over it again

1643
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:09,140
brings a bit more of clarity.

1644
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,552
How would you connect what you just said

1645
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,884
to the differences with written and oral

1646
01:21:19,932 --> 01:21:23,444
culture? Like, what is hearable? What is

1647
01:21:23,482 --> 01:21:27,444
seeable? How does writing in

1648
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:31,910
the printed or etched or digitized form

1649
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:36,724
relate to how you discussed culture

1650
01:21:36,772 --> 01:21:37,370
today?

1651
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:43,176
I see you as frozen. Danielle, can you

1652
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:46,684
hear me? I can hear

1653
01:21:46,722 --> 01:21:50,476
you. Mao. Okay, so do

1654
01:21:50,498 --> 01:21:53,228
answer, or do Mao answer? Mao, if you

1655
01:21:53,234 --> 01:21:55,628
want to. Yeah, please. I can give a

1656
01:21:55,634 --> 01:21:58,404
little bit of an idea, but effectively,

1657
01:21:58,472 --> 01:22:01,392
we're talking about precision and

1658
01:22:01,446 --> 01:22:04,384
temporality, right? So writing and

1659
01:22:04,582 --> 01:22:07,916
discourse, the discourse has to relate

1660
01:22:07,948 --> 01:22:11,216
to pragmatics, and the discourse

1661
01:22:11,248 --> 01:22:14,004
is likely to be interpreted because it

1662
01:22:14,042 --> 01:22:16,640
has lower precision than, say, writing

1663
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:20,724
has over time. So here you're talking

1664
01:22:20,762 --> 01:22:22,468
about the ways in which the information

1665
01:22:22,554 --> 01:22:26,260
geometry will be bent and shifted

1666
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:30,456
through the precision of the embedded of

1667
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:33,000
the embedded normativity that is given

1668
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:37,084
rise to through

1669
01:22:37,122 --> 01:22:39,644
these markers that you can point to over

1670
01:22:39,682 --> 01:22:41,704
and over and over with high precision.

1671
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:43,310
I think that's the link.

1672
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,780
Basically. So when I talked about role

1673
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,096
taking and language, I claim that the

1674
01:22:52,118 --> 01:22:54,000
core reason why this matter is because

1675
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,888
this enforce coherence between the

1676
01:22:55,894 --> 01:22:57,296
cognitive landscape experienced by

1677
01:22:57,318 --> 01:23:00,416
agents and writing changes massively the

1678
01:23:00,438 --> 01:23:02,736
scale at which it is possible. And it

1679
01:23:02,758 --> 01:23:04,924
changes massively the level of emotional

1680
01:23:04,972 --> 01:23:08,032
embeddedness of language.

1681
01:23:08,096 --> 01:23:10,308
It is much lower in speech than sorry,

1682
01:23:10,394 --> 01:23:13,168
much higher in speech than it is in

1683
01:23:13,274 --> 01:23:15,768
writing, especially if you account for

1684
01:23:15,934 --> 01:23:19,080
singing as a form of speech. So

1685
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:23,284
historically writing very clearly

1686
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:26,316
and very ambiguously powered the rise of

1687
01:23:26,338 --> 01:23:28,750
administration. So states so

1688
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:33,304
organization that do a lot of accounting

1689
01:23:33,352 --> 01:23:35,736
and bookkeeping like book is literally

1690
01:23:35,768 --> 01:23:38,608
in the word and that enable the

1691
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:41,440
centralization of resource management.

1692
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:45,804
This is explained in detail in the logic

1693
01:23:45,852 --> 01:23:49,730
of writing by Goody Goody.

1694
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:54,340
And yeah,

1695
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:57,504
basically this writing is a core

1696
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,312
cultural innovation that enables

1697
01:23:59,376 --> 01:24:02,020
centralized policies, city states,

1698
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:03,190
things like that.

1699
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,410
Yeah, that's very interesting.

1700
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:12,724
So one topic Avel that we've discussed

1701
01:24:12,772 --> 01:24:15,652
and maybe you could unpack a little bit

1702
01:24:15,726 --> 01:24:19,260
here is thinking of culture and

1703
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:23,388
these cognitive ecosystems leads to

1704
01:24:23,474 --> 01:24:26,012
consideration of the cognitive security

1705
01:24:26,146 --> 01:24:28,292
or of different information risk

1706
01:24:28,376 --> 01:24:30,992
aspects. So where does that come into

1707
01:24:31,046 --> 01:24:34,496
play with the formalism or what

1708
01:24:34,518 --> 01:24:36,130
you discussed here?

1709
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:41,200
So, from a cognitive security aspect,

1710
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:44,704
one thing you can read in the formalism

1711
01:24:44,752 --> 01:24:46,260
quite directly is that if you control

1712
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:47,984
the environment as in the cognitive

1713
01:24:48,032 --> 01:24:49,636
landscape experienced by agent, you

1714
01:24:49,658 --> 01:24:52,900
control what the agent do directly.

1715
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:57,624
So there are two things that are

1716
01:24:57,662 --> 01:25:00,616
very stereotypically associated with

1717
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:03,560
cognitive security. This is Russian

1718
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:05,888
propaganda, not quite propaganda.

1719
01:25:05,924 --> 01:25:08,044
Cognitive warfare campaigns pretty much

1720
01:25:08,082 --> 01:25:11,310
around the world more generally the

1721
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,816
propaganda that is used by authoritarian

1722
01:25:13,848 --> 01:25:17,550
regimes to get stuff going and the

1723
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:26,332
cults that historically are tied

1724
01:25:26,396 --> 01:25:29,900
to the worry of brain control by evil

1725
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,428
cults that can control you from afar

1726
01:25:32,524 --> 01:25:36,468
like you had a telecommand. And so

1727
01:25:36,634 --> 01:25:40,436
in both cases actually,

1728
01:25:40,538 --> 01:25:43,636
let us get back a bit. When you are a

1729
01:25:43,658 --> 01:25:48,196
state that does propaganda and when

1730
01:25:48,218 --> 01:25:49,496
you are a state you can do a lot of

1731
01:25:49,518 --> 01:25:51,096
material engineering so producing the

1732
01:25:51,118 --> 01:25:55,192
environmental states in which people

1733
01:25:55,246 --> 01:25:58,380
live in. And for example,

1734
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,744
if you look at the city of Brazilia,

1735
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:04,030
which is one of the very few

1736
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,404
specifically built capital city that

1737
01:26:07,442 --> 01:26:09,212
exists in the world, there is like one

1738
01:26:09,266 --> 01:26:11,710
in there is Brazilian and there is like

1739
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:15,904
maybe four others. And those cities are

1740
01:26:16,022 --> 01:26:17,852
basically very big, glorified

1741
01:26:17,916 --> 01:26:21,236
administrative centers. And Brazilian in

1742
01:26:21,258 --> 01:26:25,136
particular, it has neighborhoods

1743
01:26:25,168 --> 01:26:26,656
for work, neighborhoods for leisure,

1744
01:26:26,688 --> 01:26:30,608
neighborhoods for habitation.

1745
01:26:30,704 --> 01:26:34,516
It is extremely divided and because of

1746
01:26:34,538 --> 01:26:37,544
this dividedness you basically don't get

1747
01:26:37,582 --> 01:26:40,196
to do stuff that are not work or hang

1748
01:26:40,228 --> 01:26:42,136
out with your family. That is not a

1749
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:44,308
possibility. And of course this changed

1750
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,232
massively the way people experience

1751
01:26:46,366 --> 01:26:49,628
their life and this change massively the

1752
01:26:49,634 --> 01:26:51,196
topology of this network that can

1753
01:26:51,218 --> 01:26:54,632
emerge. But when you are doing cognitive

1754
01:26:54,696 --> 01:26:57,656
warfare in the sense that NATO defines

1755
01:26:57,688 --> 01:27:00,724
so you are state or state organization

1756
01:27:00,872 --> 01:27:03,248
and you are trying to fuck with another

1757
01:27:03,334 --> 01:27:05,036
state or state organization you don't

1758
01:27:05,068 --> 01:27:07,824
get to just build cities that are bad

1759
01:27:07,942 --> 01:27:10,210
but it's not possibility that you have.

1760
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:14,704
So what the Russians do in a systematic

1761
01:27:14,752 --> 01:27:17,808
way is to try to basically create dots

1762
01:27:17,984 --> 01:27:20,964
over what information is reliable so

1763
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:24,192
that people feel paralyzed. The target,

1764
01:27:24,256 --> 01:27:26,328
I must insist critically is not the

1765
01:27:26,334 --> 01:27:28,200
information that is available. It shows

1766
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:30,468
that people can have the actionability

1767
01:27:30,564 --> 01:27:32,376
that the people can give to the

1768
01:27:32,398 --> 01:27:34,632
information. And so they tend to

1769
01:27:34,686 --> 01:27:36,576
propagate a lot of conspiracy theory

1770
01:27:36,628 --> 01:27:38,316
nonsense because it occupies a lot of

1771
01:27:38,338 --> 01:27:40,040
space and it prevents the possibility

1772
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:43,100
for public debates to occur. And another

1773
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:46,060
strategy they use is to manipulate the

1774
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:48,776
personal identity that are embedded

1775
01:27:48,808 --> 01:27:52,576
often in ethnicity or in the case of

1776
01:27:52,598 --> 01:27:56,080
the US advanced countries

1777
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:01,164
where political life is mostly decoupled

1778
01:28:01,292 --> 01:28:03,604
from ethnicity. And I understand the

1779
01:28:03,642 --> 01:28:05,316
irony to say that this is the case in

1780
01:28:05,338 --> 01:28:08,960
the US. But you don't have ethnically

1781
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,604
specific parties or armed forces, so

1782
01:28:11,642 --> 01:28:14,436
this is less the case than elsewhere.

1783
01:28:14,548 --> 01:28:16,712
So in these countries they will use

1784
01:28:16,766 --> 01:28:18,376
political identity, so they will use

1785
01:28:18,398 --> 01:28:21,444
republican identity or leftist

1786
01:28:21,492 --> 01:28:24,340
identity, but mostly republican identity

1787
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:28,040
to just push complete nonsense and

1788
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:30,276
get people to act in a way that overall

1789
01:28:30,308 --> 01:28:32,684
destabilizes the grip of the US over

1790
01:28:32,882 --> 01:28:36,412
their own population. And so this is the

1791
01:28:36,466 --> 01:28:39,904
basic way

1792
01:28:39,942 --> 01:28:41,616
that we do connective warfare. And you

1793
01:28:41,638 --> 01:28:43,392
can understand this in terms of social

1794
01:28:43,446 --> 01:28:46,892
constraints because again, the target

1795
01:28:46,956 --> 01:28:49,010
is not like information in of itself.

1796
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:52,964
It's the possibility that is afforded by

1797
01:28:53,002 --> 01:28:56,084
the social context in which we evolve at

1798
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:59,568
an instant. The goal is to create doubts

1799
01:28:59,664 --> 01:29:01,936
and noise in the public setting. It's

1800
01:29:01,968 --> 01:29:04,292
rate constraints that are not compatible

1801
01:29:04,356 --> 01:29:06,520
with efficient collective organization.

1802
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:11,560
And a way where you do it

1803
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:15,464
is when you see it being done in a much

1804
01:29:15,502 --> 01:29:17,864
more systematic and efficient way is of

1805
01:29:17,902 --> 01:29:21,052
course with intra state influence where

1806
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,604
state administrators and state

1807
01:29:22,642 --> 01:29:24,904
institutions, they try to create grip

1808
01:29:24,952 --> 01:29:28,524
over a population. And if you look

1809
01:29:28,562 --> 01:29:32,176
at the birth of nationalism like we have

1810
01:29:32,198 --> 01:29:34,608
the notion today that nations are

1811
01:29:34,694 --> 01:29:36,672
somewhat coherent political groups that

1812
01:29:36,726 --> 01:29:38,992
let us say the French hang out together

1813
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:42,260
and take decision together. This notion,

1814
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,344
it's not quite recent, strictly

1815
01:29:45,392 --> 01:29:47,008
speaking, but the fact that it's

1816
01:29:47,024 --> 01:29:48,372
dominant, that it is just a standard

1817
01:29:48,426 --> 01:29:50,900
expectation, is very recent. And it

1818
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:55,370
derives from the French that

1819
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:58,212
somehow where a group of administrators

1820
01:29:58,276 --> 01:30:01,048
somehow managed to convince everyone

1821
01:30:01,134 --> 01:30:03,624
that they shared identity and they

1822
01:30:03,662 --> 01:30:04,676
shared mutual obligation,

1823
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:05,864
responsibility in virtue of this

1824
01:30:05,902 --> 01:30:09,484
identity. And the way in which

1825
01:30:09,522 --> 01:30:12,556
this happens is they sent instituters in

1826
01:30:12,578 --> 01:30:16,012
villages and they sent soldiers and the

1827
01:30:16,066 --> 01:30:17,516
children had to listen to the

1828
01:30:17,618 --> 01:30:19,788
instituters explain to them that they

1829
01:30:19,794 --> 01:30:21,484
were French and they needed to do French

1830
01:30:21,532 --> 01:30:23,756
things like going to war for France.

1831
01:30:23,868 --> 01:30:27,424
And if you did not let the children do

1832
01:30:27,462 --> 01:30:30,016
that, you went to prison. And no one

1833
01:30:30,038 --> 01:30:33,830
wants to go to prison. Of course,

1834
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,350
I'm doing a very huge caricature here.

1835
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,176
There is not a shadowy set of influence

1836
01:30:40,208 --> 01:30:43,648
that sense. This is an

1837
01:30:43,754 --> 01:30:46,376
overspecification. But what happened is

1838
01:30:46,398 --> 01:30:48,200
that the French state managed to create

1839
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:52,468
a social niche up in a very very foreign

1840
01:30:52,644 --> 01:30:56,324
villages where French

1841
01:30:56,372 --> 01:30:57,916
hood became a basic condition of

1842
01:30:57,938 --> 01:31:00,204
existence. Most of your social thing,

1843
01:31:00,242 --> 01:31:02,152
the fact that you were legally

1844
01:31:02,216 --> 01:31:06,104
recognized as existing, the activities

1845
01:31:06,152 --> 01:31:08,028
or activities that you had lot of those

1846
01:31:08,114 --> 01:31:09,916
were embedded in your perception of

1847
01:31:09,938 --> 01:31:12,556
being French. And so when this is the

1848
01:31:12,578 --> 01:31:14,296
case and when you see that

1849
01:31:14,338 --> 01:31:16,336
administration tends to be on top of

1850
01:31:16,358 --> 01:31:18,736
things, administration tells you you

1851
01:31:18,758 --> 01:31:20,176
have to go to war in virtue of your

1852
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:22,460
freshness, then you go to war. You don't

1853
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,256
fight against the administration. You

1854
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:25,896
fight against whoever administration

1855
01:31:25,948 --> 01:31:29,568
tells you fact that you have agreed

1856
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,976
implicitly that you are French

1857
01:31:31,008 --> 01:31:34,036
beforehand makes this lot harder to

1858
01:31:34,058 --> 01:31:37,704
resist basically than if the state just

1859
01:31:37,822 --> 01:31:39,416
sent soldier at you and kidnapped you

1860
01:31:39,438 --> 01:31:41,368
and gave you a swear until you fight.

1861
01:31:41,534 --> 01:31:43,192
This is not how you make things

1862
01:31:43,246 --> 01:31:45,784
efficient. Army Ras this way are

1863
01:31:45,822 --> 01:31:47,368
unorganized. They are unmotivated, they

1864
01:31:47,374 --> 01:31:50,556
are not good. And if you want people to

1865
01:31:50,578 --> 01:31:53,484
have stakes, you need to give them power

1866
01:31:53,682 --> 01:31:55,256
or you need to give them the impression

1867
01:31:55,288 --> 01:31:56,744
they have power because they are French.

1868
01:31:56,792 --> 01:32:00,416
And here. French Governs things.

1869
01:32:00,518 --> 01:32:02,284
And whether you are in the set of French

1870
01:32:02,332 --> 01:32:04,450
that actually direct things or not,

1871
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:07,696
bad question to ask. Just go to the

1872
01:32:07,718 --> 01:32:11,428
trenches. And this type of

1873
01:32:11,594 --> 01:32:13,664
things we would not think as cognitive

1874
01:32:13,712 --> 01:32:15,990
warfare because we would not think as

1875
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:21,044
between. Implicitly, when we talk about

1876
01:32:21,082 --> 01:32:23,044
warfare, we talk about between states or

1877
01:32:23,082 --> 01:32:24,984
between nation conflict. And this is

1878
01:32:25,022 --> 01:32:27,384
within a nation, within a social group.

1879
01:32:27,502 --> 01:32:31,112
But you can look at cults and

1880
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:34,088
how they create social influence. You

1881
01:32:34,094 --> 01:32:35,828
can look at, for example, one of the

1882
01:32:35,854 --> 01:32:38,716
most famous cults that existed, which is

1883
01:32:38,738 --> 01:32:41,020
the Munis or the Unification Church.

1884
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,292
They were widely accused to make

1885
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:47,436
brainwashing. They were accused to

1886
01:32:47,458 --> 01:32:49,084
somehow control people and make them do

1887
01:32:49,122 --> 01:32:50,476
things they don't want to do. That is

1888
01:32:50,498 --> 01:32:51,468
not a possibility. You have an

1889
01:32:51,474 --> 01:32:53,756
organization like you cannot kidnap

1890
01:32:53,788 --> 01:32:55,424
people and hope that it will be okay.

1891
01:32:55,462 --> 01:32:57,888
You will get killed by police if you do

1892
01:32:57,894 --> 01:33:00,384
that. Most likely in the US. In this

1893
01:33:00,422 --> 01:33:03,808
specific space where the education

1894
01:33:03,894 --> 01:33:06,036
church evolved. What you can do is to

1895
01:33:06,058 --> 01:33:08,420
create a context where you have a huge

1896
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:11,344
grip over what people can and cannot

1897
01:33:11,392 --> 01:33:13,076
say, what they can and cannot think

1898
01:33:13,098 --> 01:33:15,850
about themselves. You can tell them that

1899
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:20,810
your leader is the coming of Jesus that

1900
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:25,028
is going to bring everyone in paradise.

1901
01:33:25,204 --> 01:33:28,024
And you can make people go to work

1902
01:33:28,062 --> 01:33:30,636
sessions, talk about it and you can just

1903
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:32,924
physically cling to those people all the

1904
01:33:32,962 --> 01:33:35,436
time until you are quite confident that

1905
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:37,356
they feel that whatever you are doing is

1906
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:39,312
important. And you can have very big

1907
01:33:39,366 --> 01:33:42,796
emotional ritual where everyone cries

1908
01:33:42,908 --> 01:33:45,136
and become extremely embedded in the

1909
01:33:45,238 --> 01:33:47,136
group membership. And you can be

1910
01:33:47,158 --> 01:33:49,890
extremely supportive of group members

1911
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:53,104
while being extremely aggressive to

1912
01:33:53,142 --> 01:33:55,984
anything that go away from group

1913
01:33:56,022 --> 01:33:57,616
identity. And when you process this

1914
01:33:57,638 --> 01:33:59,396
environment and people and goats in this

1915
01:33:59,418 --> 01:34:01,808
environment for a long time, they tend

1916
01:34:01,824 --> 01:34:03,976
to develop this group identity. So when

1917
01:34:03,998 --> 01:34:06,504
you tell them the big leader tells you

1918
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:12,404
to give us €20,000

1919
01:34:12,452 --> 01:34:15,610
for your ancestors not to go to hell,

1920
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:19,676
that seems reasonable. That seems like a

1921
01:34:19,698 --> 01:34:21,180
reasonable ask, which it would not

1922
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,710
unless you had a very tight control over

1923
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,708
the social environment of someone

1924
01:34:25,794 --> 01:34:29,410
because then it's not just giving money

1925
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:32,272
in exchange for a good. This is about

1926
01:34:32,326 --> 01:34:34,592
upholding your self identity as someone

1927
01:34:34,646 --> 01:34:38,160
who follows and believes the culture.

1928
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:40,656
And yet again, this is something that is

1929
01:34:40,678 --> 01:34:42,592
formalized directly in terms of

1930
01:34:42,646 --> 01:34:44,116
constraints because this is about what

1931
01:34:44,138 --> 01:34:45,732
you can and cannot do in a given social

1932
01:34:45,786 --> 01:34:48,704
context. This is not about abstract

1933
01:34:48,752 --> 01:34:50,516
beliefs, it's not about brain control.

1934
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:53,796
It's not about anything but what you can

1935
01:34:53,818 --> 01:34:56,040
and cannot do in a given social context.

1936
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:02,806
All right, there was a ton there. Let me

1937
01:35:02,828 --> 01:35:05,350
kind of retrace a few of the pieces that

1938
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:09,606
I heard there. So towards framing

1939
01:35:09,718 --> 01:35:12,742
cognitive security under this cognitive

1940
01:35:12,806 --> 01:35:14,006
constraint framework that you're

1941
01:35:14,038 --> 01:35:16,486
discussing, for which active inference

1942
01:35:16,518 --> 01:35:18,186
under the free energy principle is the

1943
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:20,922
process theory that gets it done. First

1944
01:35:20,976 --> 01:35:24,366
you described how modern states have a

1945
01:35:24,388 --> 01:35:26,894
lot of administrative capacity and

1946
01:35:26,932 --> 01:35:29,290
affordances, especially through writing

1947
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:33,546
and especially again in the last decades

1948
01:35:33,578 --> 01:35:36,638
and centuries of information environment

1949
01:35:36,734 --> 01:35:39,042
changes. And then you pointed to two

1950
01:35:39,096 --> 01:35:42,820
kind of patterns or genres or motifs of

1951
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:45,390
influence or cognitive warfare,

1952
01:35:45,550 --> 01:35:48,530
propaganda and cults discussed.

1953
01:35:48,690 --> 01:35:50,534
One example of them surely could have

1954
01:35:50,572 --> 01:35:52,342
gone into more detail, or there's other

1955
01:35:52,396 --> 01:35:54,390
examples and perspectives and so on.

1956
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:58,578
And as Mao alluded

1957
01:35:58,594 --> 01:36:01,914
to earlier, precision modulation is a

1958
01:36:01,952 --> 01:36:04,106
key aspect of constraint. I mean,

1959
01:36:04,128 --> 01:36:05,606
precision modulation of how tightly

1960
01:36:05,638 --> 01:36:09,066
you're holding the baseball bat, the

1961
01:36:09,088 --> 01:36:11,486
movement, its precision in wobble is

1962
01:36:11,508 --> 01:36:14,480
going to be related to the grasp. And so

1963
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:19,998
increasing uncertainty can lead to

1964
01:36:20,084 --> 01:36:22,302
anxiety and doubt. All of that's very

1965
01:36:22,356 --> 01:36:24,434
wrapped up in a narrative setting. Then

1966
01:36:24,472 --> 01:36:27,598
you discussed how there's a ratcheting

1967
01:36:27,694 --> 01:36:30,306
of thinking and acting like a state

1968
01:36:30,408 --> 01:36:33,540
breaking symmetries like states do, and

1969
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:37,058
getting grasp over the subject,

1970
01:36:37,154 --> 01:36:38,722
over the citizen. That's a complex

1971
01:36:38,786 --> 01:36:41,414
topic, but that's what you went and then

1972
01:36:41,452 --> 01:36:45,430
there are asymmetries around control

1973
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,838
of the environment, the information

1974
01:36:46,924 --> 01:36:49,562
environment, ability to read, write,

1975
01:36:49,616 --> 01:36:51,302
edit in the information environment.

1976
01:36:51,446 --> 01:36:55,370
And that leads to these engineered

1977
01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:58,474
distributions of what is important or

1978
01:36:58,512 --> 01:37:02,206
what means what, which justifies or even

1979
01:37:02,228 --> 01:37:05,262
writes the blank check for requests of

1980
01:37:05,316 --> 01:37:07,934
funds, whatever the narrative is around

1981
01:37:07,972 --> 01:37:11,258
those funds. But more fundamentally,

1982
01:37:11,434 --> 01:37:15,410
those strategies can threaten sense

1983
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,758
making, which is to say the inbound

1984
01:37:17,854 --> 01:37:19,646
perceptual component of active

1985
01:37:19,678 --> 01:37:22,082
inference, and then also decision making

1986
01:37:22,216 --> 01:37:23,698
and action selection, which is the

1987
01:37:23,704 --> 01:37:26,474
fundamental complement the outbound

1988
01:37:26,622 --> 01:37:28,390
aspect of active inference.

1989
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:33,222
I'll read another comment from the Live.

1990
01:37:33,276 --> 01:37:34,246
Oh yeah? Do you want to add anything

1991
01:37:34,268 --> 01:37:37,526
else on? Like, I'd like to point out a

1992
01:37:37,548 --> 01:37:38,818
very specific example that is

1993
01:37:38,844 --> 01:37:44,954
contemporary, which is the

1994
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:48,314
campaign by Israel to remove people from

1995
01:37:48,352 --> 01:37:52,426
the Gaza band. So just I

1996
01:37:52,448 --> 01:37:53,934
don't know when people will watch it.

1997
01:37:53,972 --> 01:37:56,702
So on the 7 October, 11 days ago,

1998
01:37:56,836 --> 01:37:58,874
Hamas, which is a terrorist

1999
01:37:58,922 --> 01:38:00,526
organization, Islamist organization that

2000
01:38:00,548 --> 01:38:03,034
is dominant in the Gazaban, attacked

2001
01:38:03,082 --> 01:38:06,446
Israeli and slaughtered IRA settlers

2002
01:38:06,478 --> 01:38:08,606
that were nearby and slaughtered

2003
01:38:08,638 --> 01:38:10,926
tourists that were nearby and attacked

2004
01:38:10,958 --> 01:38:12,434
military bases. They made, I think,

2005
01:38:12,472 --> 01:38:14,050
2000 deaths.

2006
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:19,606
The state of Israel that is

2007
01:38:19,628 --> 01:38:23,122
currently led by very far right parties,

2008
01:38:23,186 --> 01:38:25,058
things that we would not have equivalent

2009
01:38:25,154 --> 01:38:28,406
of in Europe or the US has decided to

2010
01:38:28,428 --> 01:38:31,530
answer by blaming each individual

2011
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,740
Palestinian for this and trying to

2012
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:39,660
deport them like

2013
01:38:40,590 --> 01:38:42,538
this is not itself. What I'm trying to

2014
01:38:42,544 --> 01:38:43,786
comment about what I'm trying to comment

2015
01:38:43,818 --> 01:38:47,706
about is that every single comment

2016
01:38:47,738 --> 01:38:49,342
you will see about it on Twitter makes

2017
01:38:49,396 --> 01:38:50,958
the confusion between Hamas and

2018
01:38:50,964 --> 01:38:54,826
Palestinian on one side and Netanyahu

2019
01:38:54,938 --> 01:38:57,614
and the Israeli on the other side. And

2020
01:38:57,652 --> 01:39:00,114
so this produces a framing that says

2021
01:39:00,232 --> 01:39:04,402
basically people

2022
01:39:04,456 --> 01:39:06,586
are trying to decide whether the AMAs

2023
01:39:06,638 --> 01:39:09,190
action are justified or not. And

2024
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:11,526
implicitly in this debate, they create a

2025
01:39:11,548 --> 01:39:12,242
context.

2026
01:39:12,386 --> 01:39:16,662
Wherever group

2027
01:39:16,716 --> 01:39:19,922
lose the GMAC debate gets to be killed

2028
01:39:19,986 --> 01:39:23,366
to the last. And so you

2029
01:39:23,548 --> 01:39:26,506
produce very, very basically that

2030
01:39:26,528 --> 01:39:29,930
produce a framing that makes the only

2031
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,174
possibility in the conflict

2032
01:39:31,222 --> 01:39:37,966
extermination, because each side this

2033
01:39:37,988 --> 01:39:39,534
is not two side dynamic. There is no

2034
01:39:39,572 --> 01:39:42,606
Palestinian and there is the Israeli and

2035
01:39:42,628 --> 01:39:45,806
there is the I will

2036
01:39:45,828 --> 01:39:48,834
not make all the relation but by this

2037
01:39:48,872 --> 01:39:51,810
framing. Like the framing that either

2038
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:54,098
the Arabs or the Jew must prevail and

2039
01:39:54,104 --> 01:39:56,750
kill the other. You give a lot of power

2040
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:59,794
for groups to just make this a genocidal

2041
01:39:59,842 --> 01:40:02,066
war and justify things like cutting

2042
01:40:02,098 --> 01:40:05,174
water to 1 million people because like,

2043
01:40:05,292 --> 01:40:09,590
200 of them committed massacre.

2044
01:40:10,410 --> 01:40:13,642
And I do not know if there is a single

2045
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:15,706
actor that tried to get this. I do not

2046
01:40:15,728 --> 01:40:18,026
think this is the case. But this is a

2047
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:19,798
very powerful instance of how procrang

2048
01:40:19,814 --> 01:40:21,694
that does not need to target what you

2049
01:40:21,732 --> 01:40:23,966
believe, but it does need to target how

2050
01:40:23,988 --> 01:40:25,040
you frame problems.

2051
01:40:31,670 --> 01:40:34,530
Yeah. Lot to say on that.

2052
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:38,194
Any last pieces you

2053
01:40:38,232 --> 01:40:40,180
want to discuss?

2054
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:46,770
No, it is good. I have talked a lot.

2055
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:50,300
I'd like to stop talking you.

2056
01:40:52,270 --> 01:40:56,060
Okay, well, thank you. We will

2057
01:40:56,990 --> 01:41:00,186
send out updates to people about the

2058
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:03,722
coming weeks, so thank

2059
01:41:03,776 --> 01:41:06,250
you. All right, bye.

2060
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:10,410
Ciao. Thanks for your attention.
