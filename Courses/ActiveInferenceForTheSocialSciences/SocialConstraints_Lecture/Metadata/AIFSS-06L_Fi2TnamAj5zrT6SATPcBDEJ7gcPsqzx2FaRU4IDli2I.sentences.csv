4770	5320	1	A	0.5877	You.
7370	9126	2	A	1.0	Hello and welcome, everyone.
9228	12838	3	A	0.49858	It's October 18, 2023.
13004	17170	4	A	0.49193	We're in the course active inference for the social sciences.
17330	32480	5	A	1.0	And today we're in the lecture by the course co organizer, and that will kick off the final leg of the course, which is Avel Gwenin Carlos lecture, Social Constraints and the Excess Central Stance What Makes US Human.
32850	38442	6	A	0.992	So we'll be looking forward to a lecture followed by a discussion.
38506	44910	7	A	0.99636	So if you have any questions, please feel free to add them in the live chat or submit to the course syllabus.
44990	49986	8	A	1.0	And also at the end, we'll talk about how we're going to conclude this course.
50088	52690	9	A	0.99656	So with that, thank you to you, Avel.
54410	55110	10	B	0.97	Hello.
55260	57346	11	B	0.76033	So, do you see the slides correctly?
57378	58520	12	B	0.78941	Everything is fine.
62250	64920	13	B	1.0	I will take Cyland as a yes.
66490	90302	14	B	0.99235	So the role of this session is basically to show you the inspiring intuition behind the Evolve course and to show very concretely well, very abstractly, but in my mind, concretely why the specific formalism of active inference and social constraints is relevant to understand the human species and the cultural evolution of things that we do.
90436	97460	15	B	0.99986	So we'll talk of social constraints, of the existential stance, and of what makes us human.
97990	112870	16	B	0.82884	Disclaimer this presentation is closely aligned with the upcoming paper, which, whose name is the same, I think is tentative for now, and whose co author, whose man on job is a co author.
113770	119510	17	B	0.87462	So first, let us ask basic questions about the topic at hand.
119580	120870	18	B	0.99995	What is culture?
121450	124430	19	B	0.99835	By psychologist Cecilia Hayes.
124610	127514	20	B	0.99928	Culture is typically used in one of three ways.
127632	130562	21	B	0.99953	Culture can be information or behavior required socially.
130646	139386	22	B	0.93759	Like, if I am an ant and I figure out that you need to go somewhere because of pheromones, this is culture.
139498	143374	23	B	0.99998	It can be socially equipped behavior that is shared within a group.
143572	152834	24	B	0.99976	So, for example, if I am an ape and I figure out how to open nuts with a stone thing and the group just everyone does it the same way.
152872	167240	25	B	0.99913	This is culture and it can be the adaptive evolution of socially acquired behavior, which is like, if I remember well, we have evidence of it in the wild for COVID and humans only.
167950	190250	26	B	0.99738	So the question is, we know that culture is the human specific, like it is the case simply, but depending on what we mean by culture, it can describe behavior that is very much shared with other species.
190410	199330	27	B	0.99992	So a question that needs to be answered is how specific are the human cultural mechanisms?
200470	208310	28	B	0.99856	So one core thing to understand is that there is no such thing as the cultural mechanism.
208650	214178	29	B	1.0	The mechanisms of social learning in humans, they are culturally transmitted.
214354	224490	30	B	0.99979	Whether you will listen to, I don't know, elder rapper, Scientist depends on the cultural norms in which you exist.
225070	233070	31	B	1.0	And the specific way in which teacher student interaction are supposed to go is again, culturally embedded.
233730	245378	32	B	1.0	And the type of information that people will try to figure out is or transmit is itself culturally embedded so we can't just write the mechanism for human social learning.
245464	254340	33	B	0.99085	This is like empirically there is none and conceptually I don't think the notion is coherent to begin with.
256650	269542	34	B	0.99927	So one core argument for this is we have basically explicit linguistic rules about who we should trust like listen to your parents and those are linguistic.
269606	271766	35	B	1.0	And language varies from culture to culture.
271878	276650	36	B	0.63093	So this changes from culture to culture pretty straightforward.
277470	292850	37	B	0.96	And in general the practice of cultural submission, of intentional teaching they are varying between cultures and I do not want to get into it because I don't think I would say something that is accurate without notes.
293430	302850	38	B	0.99	And we can however take a look at a behavior that is I think nearly universal, which is storytelling.
303190	321910	39	B	0.99969	When people tell story, they use stories to transmit norms and in the specific culture of the Agta or Agta, I have misspelled it at least once, I think it is Agta.
322510	348130	40	B	0.99984	You have core role of storytelling in telling people what to do and you have specific tales that were studied and that were stated to specific norms and these are very important because here we have laws that are written somewhere and that people in blue will come and hit you if you don't follow them.
348200	349934	41	B	0.99989	But this is not something that is universal.
349982	358600	42	B	0.99992	So in a context where you do not have states, you typically have no really other way to transmit norms than talk about it.
362330	374358	43	B	0.99947	From there, everything is culturally embedded, like the way you transmit the norms, the kind of norms can be transmitted given this way, the way specific cues will be understood, given a specific niche, et cetera, et cetera.
374454	388190	44	B	0.50494	So yes, all this to say there is no big c culture, there is cultural transmission, there is cultural evolution but there is no specific mechanism or actual type of culture in humans.
389090	404642	45	B	0.99998	But there are categories of behavior that are very obviously human specifics and that are very obviously cultural as in direct contribution to culture.
404786	405846	46	B	0.99994	For example fire.
405948	409762	47	B	0.99986	It's obviously majorly important to culture because if you have fire you get a lot of calories.
409826	414694	48	B	1.0	If you get a lot of calories you get a big brain like you can afford big brain but fire unit doesn't produce culture.
414742	416540	49	B	0.96335	That's not how anything works.
417230	422478	50	B	0.99554	Things that do work directly to produce culture are language and role taking.
422644	425294	51	B	0.80074	So language, I think you are familiar with it.
425332	439186	52	B	0.92255	You are using it now on the receiving side, it is practice that basically embeds communicative intents into a specific set of symbols that can be letters, that can be words.
439368	441682	53	B	0.57694	Like orally it would be phoneme, I guess.
441816	448374	54	B	1.0	I don't know if the phoneme or the word is a symbol, but you have symbols and they embed meaning and people use it.
448412	455458	55	B	1.0	And what is critical is that each of the symbol has a public meaning, has a public like semantics and pragmatics.
455474	467734	56	B	1.0	If I tell you chair, maybe we don't know precisely like what specific thing enters in the chair category maybe or perceptual installation of chair will vary.
467782	483070	57	B	0.99938	But we agree on the basics of the chair, we agree on what we can do with chairs, we agree with a lot of things implicitly by the use of this word and we can use the role of syntax to manipulate this unit of meaning in a specific way.
483140	490530	58	B	0.51	I sit on a chair, I'm talking about an action that is relative to a specific object that is a chair and you understand what I mean.
490600	502200	59	B	1.0	If I was trying to mimic it, maybe I'll get it through, maybe you would think I'm saying I'm crouching over bed, why not?
503290	524362	60	B	0.5198	So the language and the fact that it has a publicly instantiated meaning is critical in keeping coordination in the specific thing that people do and why they do it, which is ambiguously cultural and you have another more subtle mechanism process, I don't know, phenomenon which is shared intentionality.
524426	544802	61	B	0.99528	So by the work of mainly Tomasello, we know that chimps are not very social and they can learn they are but as intelligent as humans, well, at least young humans, but they usually are not really interested in what?
544856	561770	62	B	0.99994	Other teams are doing and most importantly, they are not interested in sharing goals trying to figure out what is the end result that some other chimp is upholding and trying to mesh in this plan to help him.
561920	577600	63	B	0.99957	While in human from a very young age we are very stream motivated and we are very motivated to figure out what we whatever we are collectively doing and figure out what one's role is in that and do that.
578130	600034	64	B	1.0	And this is likely not bona fide cognitive function that stands on its own but it's behavior that is a cognitive process that is endemic in humans very aware if existing everywhere else and that is core to most theory of the transmission of culture.
600082	611530	65	B	0.99971	So these two things we know are human specifics up to maybe very small and important details and we know are critically embedded in what we call culture.
612270	620182	66	B	1.0	And so what I will do from now on is to provide a specific theory of culture.
620326	636526	67	B	0.5005	So the active inference of culture landscapes that in my opinion basically explains or at least meshes well with why those two specific pheromones are so important from the appalling of culture.
636558	651154	68	B	0.99999	But it also means that culture is not information Percy, it's something that is more organic and that evolves more like biological system themselves evolve than population of genes.
651282	675630	69	B	1.0	And from these accounts we will go to figure out what it means about collective organization, figure out why we have gods and taxes and from there we will go to more physical and peacemaker consideration and ask how basically this theory can be written within physics through the active inference formalism.
676930	680606	70	B	0.99927	So let us go first.
680788	691540	71	B	1.0	I am just presenting the theory of the active inference of clear landscape and I am presenting a core concept, the concept of stroke constraints that derive from at least my treatment of that.
691990	698486	72	B	0.98219	So active inference, probably a lot of you know what this is but this goes on YouTube, so I will re explain.
698668	704902	73	B	0.9958	Active inference is a theory of cognition where basically agents enact expectation of the world.
704956	715750	74	B	0.99971	They have a world model and they make predictions over the world model and they strive for those predictions to remain coherent with what they actually observe.
715910	720790	75	B	1.0	And that means that the agent will update beliefs that are false.
720950	735710	76	B	1.0	If I hear meow and I think there is no cat, I will then think that it is more likely.
735870	742774	77	B	0.99	And on the other hand, I will try to provoke to realize prediction that I kind of need.
742892	756694	78	B	0.99506	So for example, if I really want to hear meal, if I really expect to hear meal and I expect this to be like a basic step of my life, I will maybe figure out how to get a cat that works not well with cats but with drinking or eating.
756742	759734	79	B	0.43	Yeah, I expect to be a thing that has water in it because else I die.
759782	763790	80	B	0.99999	So when I'm thirsty I am thirst by drinking.
764130	776462	81	B	0.93	And you have this basically duality of predictive normal, what we call typically perception, just trying to figure out what there is outside and updating our belief when we don't.
776526	786370	82	B	0.66986	So I said perception but is more inference and there is active inference which is like the realization of this inference through action.
786870	793800	83	B	0.99	And a core argument of active inference is that those two are same process.
794330	798934	84	B	0.99423	They are the same process that is entailed by an information geometry.
798982	805370	85	B	0.99994	So basically a space of belief over which the dynamics of an agent unfold.
806190	815326	86	B	1.0	And a core feature of this approach is the dissolution of agency as we typically understand it.
815508	817066	87	B	0.96088	We typically understand agency.
817098	824850	88	B	0.75118	It will be like hey, I'm an agent, I want to do this and I will reason about what I want and I will reason about how to get it.
824920	827300	89	B	0.52	And we'll do the thing that I reasoned about.
828230	830420	90	B	0.62573	Reason is important.
830790	836600	91	B	0.99895	It's not the basic cognitive function that analyze everything we do.
836970	839510	92	B	1.0	I do not think this statement is controversial.
840330	853814	93	B	0.99	And in active inference the model we have is that at multiple scale, in multiple contexts, we produce prediction over our sensor flow and then strive to realize those prediction.
853942	865354	94	B	0.99915	So what that means is that our action are not constrained by will in a joke case, they are constrained by what looks more like self model, a model of oneself.
865482	872554	95	B	1.0	And what oneself would typically do in contexts such as the one I'm exposed.
872602	873200	96	A	1.0	To.
877750	882526	97	B	0.63041	Related concepts is the notion of skill and intentionality.
882638	893800	98	B	0.99987	So this is this skill intentionality thing is a theory that stands at the interface between active inference and ecological psychology which I will absolutely not get into.
894490	898858	99	B	1.0	And the core argument of skillet and shallity is that when you are a skilled agent.
898944	913550	100	B	0.99869	So agents that understand how to do things in the world well, you do not experience the world as represented space in 3D with 3D models in it.
913620	922880	101	B	0.95	And each object is well defined and has a lot of properties that are embedded in a world model that you have in a video game.
923810	928954	102	B	1.0	What you see is a landscape of basic opportunities for action.
929002	929870	103	B	1.0	I will see a computer.
929940	934190	104	B	1.0	I know I can mash the keys.
934610	936194	105	B	1.0	I think you say keys.
936362	939766	106	B	1.0	And I know I can go to the Internet, and I know I can do this or that.
939788	943302	107	B	1.0	I see a door, I know I can go through it if it's open, I can close it.
943436	946294	108	B	1.0	I can go through it if it's closed, and I can open it.
946412	949350	109	B	0.99949	This is the basic opportunities that the door presents.
950250	967310	110	B	0.99	And you don't say a logical consequence, but very coherent entitlement of active inference is that I will see minimal model of things around me that are based on the opportunities for action that they present.
967380	979810	111	B	0.99	I will orient my attention minimally to grasp what I can do with things and what the field, the perceptive field that I live in is a landscape of those affordances.
980790	986994	112	B	0.99978	So the picture is an extract from Fallout Novegas, which is the greatest RPG.
987042	987734	113	B	0.99849	Please play it.
987772	988758	114	B	0.99998	This is important.
988924	992230	115	B	0.5	Only thing you need to keep in mind about this course.
992380	1002550	116	B	1.0	And that shows you like, radio in three D F radio, and you have an action button that tells you whether you want to activate the radio.
1002630	1004582	117	B	0.99	And you have HPS and APS.
1004646	1006714	118	B	0.98	I have no idea what AP is.
1006912	1022334	119	B	0.97	And this looks more like naive feel than what you'd get into a really realistic presentation of, like a picture, photo picture of your environments, because you have the perception of the object.
1022452	1041078	120	B	0.99977	Like, you have 3D array represents your vision of an object, but it's embedded in things that tell you where you're looking at, things that tell you what you can do with things, things that tell you what are your states, what are your basic states when you're engaging with this object?
1041244	1067378	121	B	1.0	And this is, I think, pretty nice illustration of what we could mean by attemption and the landscape for what is actually being transmitted.
1067414	1069600	122	B	0.93074	You need less issues.
1071010	1073902	123	A	0.99997	Sorry, Avel, could you repeat the last 30 seconds there?
1073956	1076420	124	A	0.99989	It was just like it hung up.
1077350	1079646	125	A	0.99649	Okay, just repeat the last 30 seconds.
1079678	1080546	126	A	0.99997	Thank you.
1080728	1085026	127	B	0.99995	So this is a picture from Fallout Nivegas, which is a good game.
1085208	1100214	128	B	1.0	And I claim that it is a pretty good illustration of what we talk when we talk about action rated perception, because you see the object and with through the object, you also see what opportunities for action it presents.
1100262	1106090	129	B	0.99993	In this case, activate the radio and you see it in the way it is embedded with your physiological states.
1106160	1108380	130	B	0.99195	So the HP and AP.
1110270	1125860	131	B	0.92	And a core feature of that is that when I experience affordances, I feel directly through the perception whether the affordance is good or bad.
1127030	1133570	132	B	1.0	If I see, I don't know, a cliff and all, of a sudden I can fall off the cliff and die.
1134070	1135698	133	B	0.99999	This will cause fair.
1135864	1148370	134	B	1.0	The perception of that possibility of falling and dying will be negatively loaded if I see, I don't know, a hot bed in winter and I know I can now rest after a day of work where I was cold.
1148450	1149494	135	B	1.0	I will be happy about it.
1149532	1153866	136	B	1.0	I will perceive the possibility in a positively balanced way.
1154048	1159386	137	B	1.0	And so this is the case for basic physiological thing.
1159568	1163546	138	B	0.99999	But this is also the case for cultural norms and values.
1163738	1171214	139	B	0.99999	We come to experience the world as a world of affordances and this is the same for the social world.
1171332	1177730	140	B	1.0	I will feel bad or good depending on what possibility for action I will experience in a given context.
1178470	1191666	141	B	0.89	And this is a picture of forest path near Arcological site that is studied by the research group that funds me escape.
1191858	1195414	142	B	0.99	And from a pure direct perception kind.
1195452	1214140	143	B	1.0	Of way there is very complex statistical feature that are embedded in the picture but if you are a human, a thing that walks what you will perceive like feel directly, experience directly is just a possibility to walk along the path and follow it.
1214590	1219162	144	B	1.0	And this is something that you feel is a property of the path.
1219306	1220826	145	B	1.0	I think you see the path.
1220858	1222426	146	B	0.96425	You think I can go through a path?
1222458	1224990	147	B	0.9999	You don't think there is a 3d space?
1225060	1231794	148	B	1.0	And in this 3d space there is a set of statistical feature, one of which being a flat thing in the middle.
1231992	1240854	149	B	1.0	And among the enter space factions they have one of them is to walk through the path like just do this and this and this and this.
1240892	1243160	150	B	0.99998	You just feel like you can go through there.
1244410	1255994	151	B	0.5	And the way humans learn about each other, the way humans gravitate and come to expect things about each other, they can.
1256032	1261538	152	B	1.0	Develop, basically a sense of what is culturally possible or not possible in a given context.
1261734	1269742	153	B	0.99	And this sensation, this perception of cultural possibilities, it is embedded in the way we pay attention to things.
1269796	1270926	154	B	0.82729	We will pay attention to.
1270948	1276900	155	B	0.99978	Different things according to what is culturally relevant in a given context, in a given situation.
1277510	1288930	156	B	0.99	And this is a core argument of the thinking through the mind account of cultural evolution which was spearheaded by Maxwell, Ramstead and Vesier.
1289010	1291400	157	B	0.99834	Forgot his first name.
1292810	1309094	158	B	0.98	And because of everything that we saw before, because of the dissolved agency that we have in the active in France the patterns, cultural patterns in the flow of attention they will not simply be experienced.
1309142	1313594	159	B	0.93802	As abstract norms and value that one could or could not respect.
1313642	1316942	160	B	0.99996	They will effectively constrain the thing.
1316996	1324870	161	B	0.99999	You can pay attention to the outcome you expect in a way that will drive your action towards specific outcomes.
1325050	1337986	162	B	1.0	And so this cultural landscape of affordances, they embed intentionality and normativity, as in the patterns that are relevant to explain normativity and intentionality, they are in the landscape.
1338018	1343190	163	B	0.95282	They are not like only at least in your brain cells.
1344570	1364846	164	B	1.0	And a core argument, I would say, is that the engagement with a cultural landscape, it is duel to existence of social constraints where social constraints are understood as statistical patterns that will causally act over what you do or cannot do.
1365028	1373690	165	B	0.99985	So when I talk about circulatory landscape forensics, I am implicitly talking about a set of constraints that acts over behavior.
1373850	1379140	166	B	0.89	And this I've demonstrated by talking about meditivity and the like.
1382870	1392200	167	B	0.98702	You have how to say you have arid nuance in the notion of constraints, which is that.
1405960	1414410	168	A	0.39148	Avel sorry, again, Avel from your side.
1414860	1416680	169	A	0.95297	I'm not hearing any audio.
1420590	1422780	170	A	0.76856	Mao or Maria, do you hear him?
1423390	1424138	171	C	0.99652	No, nothing.
1424224	1427430	172	B	0.9998	You can't write every over collective behavior.
1427510	1429594	173	B	0.59552	So where is the scale of one specification?
1429722	1430398	174	B	1.0	Yes.
1430564	1431440	175	A	1.0	All right.
1432450	1435310	176	A	0.99999	Could you repeat the last 45 seconds?
1436710	1438242	177	B	0.71753	Can you hear me now?
1438376	1439060	178	A	1.0	Yeah.
1440470	1454258	179	B	0.99754	Okay, so what I'm saying is that the engagement with cultural landscape forensics, it is dual to the existence of social constraints which act over individual behavior.
1454434	1469210	180	B	0.99995	Because when I engage individually with the landscape forensics that is a characteristic of my local material and cultural environments, the embedded will drive my behavior, my intention, my presentation in a specific way.
1469360	1479050	181	B	0.98	And instead of looking at how each individual agent engaged with the landscape, I can look at the constraints that emerge from this collective activity.
1479210	1481280	182	B	0.98107	So is that do you hear me now?
1484490	1484998	183	B	0.65435	Okay.
1485084	1485720	184	A	1.0	Yeah.
1488190	1489340	185	B	0.99352	Okay, good.
1493710	1497420	186	B	0.92915	So let us get back to the question of what makes us human.
1498110	1504410	187	B	0.99996	We are told about human specific mechanism phenomenon that seemed to be involved in culture.
1504490	1507120	188	B	0.73452	Those were language and role taking.
1507650	1519742	189	B	1.0	And those two phenomenons seem to be pretty robust candidates to explain the coherence of a shared cultural landscape or set of circumstraints language.
1519806	1529190	190	B	0.95285	It provides a space of public presentation like representation in the classical connectivity sense that you can negotiate that are actually out there in the literal sense.
1529260	1536418	191	B	0.99942	They are sensory signals that are in the environment and that structure and Asian behavior.
1536514	1543978	192	B	0.99999	So when you talk to yourself, it will constrain what you pay attention to implicitly what you can and cannot do.
1544064	1552074	193	B	1.0	And when you talk with others, this will influence what you say and what you want to say and what you perceive to be riven to say.
1552112	1568274	194	B	0.67	And so it will constrain your behavior and in a much stronger and more robust way than you could have to implicit intentionality inference and role taking in a more subtle way brings agent to think existentially, to not ask.
1568312	1579014	195	B	0.98	The question what I am supposed to do in the situation but what an agent that is embedded in the specific cultural context where I embedded is expected to do.
1579212	1594278	196	B	1.0	And so this basically forces you to have a synchronization between what you experience as possibilities for action and what you expect are cultural expectation over behavior.
1594454	1603520	197	B	0.99995	So these two mechanisms, there would be very, very strong mechanisms to enforce the coherence of cognitive landscape between agents.
1603970	1613470	198	B	0.99	And it just so happens that there are things that exist only in the one species that has full fledged, cumulative, open ended cultural evolution.
1615110	1619380	199	B	0.99918	So, yes, I think this is interesting.
1630850	1637620	200	A	0.69872	Okay, Avel, you just unshared your screen.
1638950	1639650	201	B	0.99989	Sorry?
1639800	1642180	202	A	0.99997	You unshared your screen, or is that done?
1643110	1644980	203	B	0.85193	No, I did not unshare my screen.
1647830	1649880	204	A	0.85247	Could you just reshare it?
1650730	1651094	205	B	0.68	Yeah.
1651132	1651574	206	A	0.99977	There you go.
1651612	1652406	207	A	0.99	All right.
1652588	1653254	208	A	0.99997	Looks great.
1653292	1653638	209	A	0.99994	Continue.
1653724	1654600	210	A	0.99996	Thank you.
1656890	1657640	211	B	0.9997	Nice.
1659050	1683790	212	B	0.99948	So, yes, the question is, as I said, there is duality between each agent engaging with a landscape for dense and constraints that exist over the landscape, that is shared, that is straightforward, but in the set of constraints that is characteristic of a given landscape.
1684450	1695150	213	B	0.99975	Basically, to account for perinetric culture evolution, this must be a set of constraints that changes to time, that builds new constraints and new dymical flow.
1695310	1702402	214	B	1.0	And this is something that you cannot get with a landscape in the sense of system theory.
1702466	1708178	215	B	0.85291	That is not the system theory does not deal with systems that do open ended evolution.
1708354	1727520	216	B	0.99985	So the question is, what relation can we make between the dynamics of enculturation according to which agent integrates specific cultural expectation and the dynamics of open ended cultural evolution through which cultural landscape and the constraints constructs itself through time?
1728530	1741490	217	B	0.94	And this is where we get to the more holistic side, where I think we can see why the specific construct of constraints is critical as compared to the simple cultural landscape approach.
1741910	1743540	218	B	0.99947	Let us take a look at this.
1744390	1748050	219	B	0.80943	There is a thing called biological autonomy.
1748210	1762860	220	B	0.99314	It is quite recent term in its formalization, the relevant formalization that describes the ability of a living system for self construction, like maintaining one structure and challenging it through developmental and evolutionary time.
1763390	1770726	221	B	0.98	And the best formalization we have had so far is from Montevil and Mossio, and it's constraint closure.
1770918	1787570	222	B	0.65	A constraint is simply a relatively slow physical process that shapes a faster process, like canalized material or information or energy flow without itself being affected at the timescale of the interaction.
1788230	1796702	223	B	0.99	And for Monteville Mosio, you get biological autonomy where you get a set of constraints that collectively produce itself.
1796856	1804758	224	B	0.99945	Each constraint is produced by other constraints in a set, and each constraint produces other constraints in the set.
1804924	1806854	225	B	0.99997	This is a very simple ID.
1806972	1813222	226	B	0.57949	This is a very informal ID in the sense that it doesn't have dynamics, doesn't have a physics.
1813366	1816810	227	B	0.99411	It is just a formal statement of what we mean by autonomy.
1817550	1828270	228	B	0.98	And this IV basically is the best grounding we have to think about what is living and what is an agent, although in itself it does not entail agency.
1829170	1854322	229	B	0.56	And when we look at social systems or any systems as a set of constraints, what you can see is that systems such as the brain multiscale organized system, they can be read as basically a set of nested constraints like your DMN, the activity of your default mode network, which is the basal activity of the brain.
1854386	1866202	230	B	1.0	In the absence of stimulation, it basically is constituted of chemical constraints over what the composite tissues do at a given point in time.
1866336	1879258	231	B	1.0	And this itself is a constraint over what individual cells do full time, which itself is a constraint over the evolution law of an individual cell, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
1879354	1893780	232	B	0.53149	So I can always look at a multiscale system as a set of nested constraints at nested scales and in systems that are autonomous, that are biological cognitive agent.
1895430	1901880	233	B	1.0	Not only the smaller scale systems like cell.
1903130	1909560	234	B	0.80198	They enable, they construct, and they enact the constraints that are aeroscale agents.
1910490	1915498	235	B	0.99984	But aeroscale agents can also shape back the behavior of low scale agent.
1915664	1926602	236	B	0.81071	Like of course, if I do something which is something that I as an agent do, this will constrain the activity of my neural networks.
1926666	1930494	237	B	0.9999	This is like heavy and learning, this is common to all model of learning.
1930612	1957218	238	B	0.60561	Learning goes through change in network structure and so there is an opportunity to model emerging agent from collective network activity and to look at the interaction between description at nested scales of behavior and this is applicable very straightforwardly to the human species.
1957314	1969114	239	B	0.9993	So this is sumerianity state and something that you can look is that it is very dense, it has very dense building that are built in a specific way.
1969312	1976458	240	B	1.0	It is near a river which enables the trade at great distance.
1976634	1993650	241	B	0.63343	It has a bridge, so entry to the city is constrained to a specific point and it is essentially surrounded by several fields very flatlands, that are rubble, that are fertilized, probably by water from the river.
1994150	2003880	242	B	1.0	And basically all of these feature are enabled the production of first aid societies, societies with a central administration that does stuff.
2004250	2012658	243	B	1.0	And these societies will robustly produce context, material context, that favorite is their own survival.
2012754	2017898	244	B	0.99995	For example, dance settlements it enable you to have everyone together to tell them what to do.
2017984	2034820	245	B	0.87166	Temples which give a matter of grounding to the authority of the state, bridges that allow you to move things around and to control what gets in and out and more cultural cereal fields that allow you to take the food and bring it back to the city.
2035590	2072274	246	B	1.0	And the production of such settlements and such material environments by states is somewhat robust intercultural phenomenon at a more like ancient or multicultural scale you have a set of process that are critical in the construction and action of norms in humans and most likely common ancestor to those processes is dancing and singing.
2072422	2073818	247	B	0.83999	Dancing and singing.
2073914	2078058	248	B	0.87836	They give you embodied synchronization.
2078234	2081466	249	B	1.0	And this is shown to drive development of group identity.
2081658	2086990	250	B	0.57	And this gives you, basically, emotional grounding of the norms that are shared within society.
2087070	2091054	251	B	0.99995	Because those norms, they are not abstract expectation.
2091182	2096142	252	B	0.99992	They are embedded in your specific emotions, in your specific embodiment.
2096206	2103282	253	B	0.93114	While you do things that are critical to your ecology and ritual activity and storytelling.
2103346	2110546	254	B	0.99993	They allow more complexity of the martivity by using symbolism and the system of tomativity.
2110578	2126190	255	B	0.61867	There are maybe less embedded, embodied sorry, so less embedded in the one's direct experience but they allow a more complexity in the nature of the norms that are transmitted and enforced.
2126930	2143230	256	B	1.0	And these norms, by the simple fact that they are perceptible through metal symbolism and through storytelling they become a causal force in the cultural landscape that is shared by a group member.
2143390	2155830	257	B	0.82264	So they become things that are the power to produce or constrain the framing in which people will read specific situation and therefore constrain and produce social behavior.
2156410	2162166	258	B	0.97	And this is, like I've said this already, so this looks like repetition.
2162198	2174654	259	B	0.9998	But I want to hammer this because if this is the case, then we can be interested in what complex tails sorry.
2174772	2185710	260	B	0.99701	In agency that emerges from the constraints embedded in complex tails so we know that people can perceive non material agents under certain conditions.
2186130	2188622	261	B	0.99999	This is common in schizophrenia.
2188766	2194514	262	B	0.97041	Like, you will hear voices that tells you to do things and that are not embedded in a specific body.
2194632	2206360	263	B	0.62372	This is common in decade Valentine's disorder because you will have agents that basically share your body while having and existing, while not being tied to a specific body.
2209050	2210706	264	B	0.99315	Sorry, I'm misspeaking.
2210738	2215146	265	B	0.7	One specific personality can exist while they are not in control of your body.
2215248	2249590	266	B	1.0	And so in a way that is not contingent on the direct material in action of what they want and want not to do, and under a lot of anthropologically described conditions that are not considered pathological, you can basically have regimes of attention that produce enormous reagent that you can talk with and that have motivation and that have limited traits, which are often called tulpas, which is a term borrowed from Buddhist literature.
2250650	2276574	267	B	0.55	And so this emergence of the material agent how to say, if I consider an agent to be something a closed set of constraints and I consider things like tails and ritual as mechanism that produce constraints in behavior there is basically no difficulty whatsoever at conceptual level.
2276612	2286500	268	B	0.99999	There is no unexpectedness or no complexity to say that specific systems of constraint that happen to be closed and that are embellished in those tales and rituals, they exist as biological agent.
2288630	2299890	269	B	0.73712	So we kind of have basically a model of gods, of non material agents which is a better, less logical way to put it that relies on systematic training of your regime of attention.
2300050	2305894	270	B	0.98	And of course, when it's collective, it will like those agents will be social agents.
2305932	2312438	271	B	0.95877	They will be things that have power, that have the ability to frame the debate around specific things.
2312604	2316250	272	B	0.99	If you and I think is sorry.
2316400	2322846	273	B	1.0	The painting that is on the right of the screen is a painting by William Blake that presents basically.
2322948	2344014	274	B	0.95	A late 18th, I think notion of God, which is not really Old Testament, which is a bit more New Testament, but which is often sensation of the clockmaker God that was popular at the time and what you see on the painting is resent.
2344062	2363082	275	B	0.96978	So William Blake's version of God that is in the sky like, very powerful, very juice like imagery and that is using this, his hand, to draw a compass, that is considered a symbol of constructing things of masonry like.
2363136	2367114	276	B	1.0	The compass is one of the Freemason symbol for the same reason.
2367152	2372102	277	B	0.99919	It is a symbol of orderly creation in William Blake's paintings.
2372246	2394146	278	B	0.99	And so if we share a belief that there is a God somewhere and he built the world as it is intentionally and this God is benevolent or at least much too powerful for us to fight with basically European they bold on to following the order because if you don't, god will remove you from the order.
2394248	2396020	279	B	0.81	And you don't want that, do you?
2396650	2428160	280	B	0.95396	So even if you don't have the existence of a material institution of this God, even if people don't really believe that there is actually a guy with a bird that does stuff, the shared ritualized belief in an entity that has this specific motivation and these specific traits, it will shape heavily the social landscape that is available to everyone.
2428770	2444820	281	B	1.0	And this is compatible with although it does not entail the existence of actual agency that is tied to this specific entity through the constraints that this entity concretely is.
2445190	2463866	282	B	1.0	And something that I find again interesting is that religion that are popular today so Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism if you think of something as a religion, it will likely fall under this handle are typically what White House call?
2463888	2480080	283	B	0.9805	Doctrinal religion which are religion that are where basically you sit down and you look at rituals and there is priesthood that is trained to do the ritual in a specific way that is supposed to mean specific things.
2480450	2493490	284	B	1.0	And this is basically optimal to build very robust notions of what gods are, what they want from you, what they do, what they're motivated by, et cetera, et cetera.
2494230	2500534	285	B	0.9575	So I must insist that this is with question mark.
2500732	2531310	286	B	0.99945	But in principle, the Schoenstrains model, it can produce a touristic theory of gods and non material agent sorry, as socially embedded non material agent that are computed collectively through engagement with a specific cultural landscape where ritual and doctrinal elaboration are important components.
2532850	2543970	287	B	1.0	And I can say with exclamation mark that this model, it enables naturalistic theory of social agency that is not tied specifically to individual bodies.
2544470	2569594	288	B	1.0	If I consider a social system, actual organization to be autonomous, that is closed system of constraints, zane agency or maybe non trivial agency, it simply reduces to the power to shape this landscape and you can have emergent social things do that.
2569632	2572538	289	B	1.0	You can have states which follow specific rules.
2572634	2575802	290	B	0.82984	So social constraints and specific norms.
2575866	2581710	291	B	0.99498	So against constraints that have autonomy and that are able to shape the landscape.
2582130	2613534	292	B	0.99997	But in all of this, this part in my opinion shows that circle constraints specifically are relevant to study these social worlds, that they correspond to relevant social processes in human order, agents that are institutions and maybe again question mark, no matter agents, sorry, material agents into institution.
2613582	2614770	293	B	0.59729	So gods.
2615430	2619938	294	B	1.0	The question that needs to be asked is how we can model the portion of constraints.
2620034	2641740	295	B	0.99998	Because all of these rely on the idea that somehow in the landscape that whispers, there is such a thing as constraints and they are well defined thing that exist over a collective behavior and that they have the property to construct itself and for reason we'll very shortly see.
2642190	2646734	296	B	1.0	To frame this mathematically in a coherent way is insanely hard.
2646852	2649566	297	B	1.0	I don't know how to do it, no one knows how to do it.
2649668	2653874	298	B	0.99987	We have leads, but they are leads, nothing else.
2654072	2661246	299	B	1.0	And so we'll turn to the question of whether active inference frames a gauge theory for enculturation.
2661438	2665480	300	B	0.99896	You should know what this is by now, gauge theory, we will see that soon.
2666890	2675810	301	B	0.88262	So to explain Gold's theory, I need to explain explanation, which is fun, but mostly symmetries in physics.
2675970	2682710	302	B	0.99404	In physics we frame physical problem around symmetries symmetry.
2682790	2684566	303	B	0.99647	It is algebraic.
2684598	2695274	304	B	0.99834	So something that has composition like plus groups of transformation over the space of possibilities, which are irrelevant from the perspective of the same dynamics.
2695402	2696362	305	B	0.37731	This is very abstract.
2696426	2698350	306	B	0.99999	So let's look at symmetries.
2698850	2706994	307	B	0.99999	This is the ceiling of the Lotfola Mosque, and it's found what you can see is a symmetry under the C 32 symmetry group.
2707112	2714674	308	B	1.0	If you shift this picture by one over 32 full turn, it does not change.
2714792	2716426	309	B	0.99994	This is what we mean by a symmetry.
2716558	2722950	310	B	0.9035	This is a transformation, a set of transformation that is closed and that does not change.
2723100	2730890	311	B	0.99107	Well, not a picture of course in the context of physics, but the dynamics of the relevant system we are studying.
2731950	2737654	312	B	1.0	And for formal reasons I will not absolutely not get into here explanation.
2737702	2741306	313	B	0.99819	In physics it usually derives from the statement of symmetry.
2741418	2749598	314	B	1.0	For example, when I state that energy is conserved, this is the same formally as stating that my system is symmetric in time.
2749764	2758980	315	B	1.0	When I state that momentum is conserved, that reduce formally to stating that my system is asymmetric in space.
2759430	2760226	316	B	0.64294	Okay?
2760408	2767670	317	B	0.99716	So most things in physics can be framed as simply symmetries over system dynamics.
2770090	2776440	318	B	0.99	And a Gold theory is simply elaborate instance of this core ID.
2777130	2782002	319	B	0.99378	So if your symmetry has two properties first, it is continuous.
2782066	2791678	320	B	0.98335	So not like a set of small rotation, but like the set of all possible rotation that you can take around a circle and local.
2791764	2796000	321	B	0.99994	So you can apply the symmetry transformation to every single point in space.
2797090	2801210	322	B	0.99997	Your problem basically can be framed with realm degree of freedom.
2801290	2809406	323	B	0.99995	So because the symmetry does not change your system, whether your system where your stem is in the, for example, clockwork rotation.
2809438	2810370	324	B	0.99452	It is not important.
2810440	2812050	325	B	0.99913	It does not change the dynamics.
2812950	2816310	326	B	0.99435	So this redundant degree of freedom we call a gauge parameter.
2819610	2827430	327	B	1.0	The core feature of gauge theory is to take the geometry of that problem and make it into a physical force.
2827850	2853518	328	B	0.9817	So when I say gorgeous parameter, so this is you should see in the screen nontrivial z over two z possible bundle of a circle, which means basically that you have a circle, it has two stages, and when you are over it, you can be either on top or down, and you can't know where it is.
2853604	2857982	329	B	0.99757	So this is not quite the graph freedom because you have only two choices.
2858046	2861118	330	B	1.0	To get to the graph freedom, you have to get a continuous space of choices.
2861294	2864110	331	B	0.99951	But this is basically what we mean by gold parameter.
2864190	2878806	332	B	0.99986	It is a geometric property of your system that you know mathematically exists, but that cannot possibly be observed or how to say corresponds to a choice in how you observe your system.
2878908	2883210	333	B	0.96769	So this is why we talk of GOJ, because this is a choice in how we inspire the system.
2883280	2888060	334	B	0.65249	But I will not get into the details of this here.
2889150	2900640	335	B	0.98	And the thing is that because of its redundancy, the Goch parameter does not have to be the same in a specific trajectory at any given point in space.
2901250	2904014	336	B	0.99	And from that you get curvature.
2904142	2908820	337	B	0.7	And curvature if you are anywhere near physics and, you know.
2917970	2922926	338	A	0.81527	Avil okay, last thing we heard was if you're anywhere.
2922958	2928340	339	B	0.99998	In physics about relativity theory, you will know that curve to the naive embedding space.
2928790	2931694	340	B	0.99785	So if you know vaguely about relativity.
2931742	2937720	341	A	0.99833	Theory yes, sorry, just if you're anywhere in physics and then continue from there.
2938250	2939000	342	B	1.0	Yes.
2939850	2949078	343	B	0.99996	So if you are vaguely familiar with relativity theory, you know that curvature in a space, it corresponds to forces.
2949174	2955878	344	B	0.69546	So in relativity theory, the curvature of spacetime, it corresponds to the gravity force.
2956054	2965642	345	B	0.52	And generally in physics, the curvature in other weirder gauge spaces, it translates in the other fundamental forces.
2965706	2970670	346	B	0.64907	So weak force, strong force and electromagnetism.
2971570	2981022	347	B	0.99945	So, yes, just stating that there is a space which has a gorge parameter in it and this space has a curvature.
2981166	2989080	348	B	0.96612	It entails that you have a force that emerges over the, let us say, natural framing of the problem.
2990810	2996550	349	B	1.0	And this speaks very closely to active inference.
2996970	3002970	350	B	0.99772	So active inference can be framed as a consequence of a formal result that is called the frenzy principle.
3003310	3035542	351	B	0.99962	Let us write a dimmical system stochastic which means that it has noise in it and which can be partitioned between an agent A environment B and boundary sorry, an environment E and a boundary B such that the distribution of the agent and the environment are independent from each other given the distribution of the boundary B, which kind of means that an information in E that is relevant in A and vice versa has to be in B.
3035596	3037078	352	B	0.81713	But doesn't quite mean that.
3037164	3038760	353	B	0.79018	But it's very close.
3039930	3056380	354	B	0.76511	Then you have an information geometry which is like geometrical construct where each point in the agent corresponds to its position of belief over the space of external states.
3057630	3069294	355	B	1.0	And because of this information geometry, each possible internal state of the agent, it entails implicitly a belief over external states.
3069492	3085300	356	B	0.99961	So this means that given the condition of partitionability, I can write Bayesian belief over my environment as a simple geometrical property of the space we are working in.
3085610	3091030	357	B	0.99	And as I just said, when you have a geometry and it's curved, you get forces.
3091690	3104950	358	B	0.96	And so the FEP can straightforwardly be framed as gauge theory where the symmetries in sensor entropy technically.
3105030	3119120	359	B	0.99977	But let us say the space of belief I am evolving in directly constrain my action in a specific manner to constrain biasian coherence between what I expect to be the case and what I experience to be the case.
3119570	3129602	360	B	0.99	And so straightforwardly this grounds active inference because like what I just said is what I said to explain active inference up to some technical words that were added in.
3129736	3146070	361	B	0.99954	But yes, this result entails predictive processing and predictive control of behavior of the agent and to some extent improves the possibility of this existing in bare dymical system theory.
3148250	3153478	362	B	0.99799	But I do not think that the FEP can possibly represent enculturation.
3153654	3158106	363	B	0.99356	So when I talk of a dynamical system, this is a system with dynamics in it.
3158208	3160960	364	B	0.7135	You are, I think you understand that.
3161730	3167966	365	B	1.0	I do not think you necessarily understand the formalism that we imply by it.
3168148	3176820	366	B	0.46	A mixture system is a flow function phi, a time parameter t and a state space x.
3177270	3186470	367	B	0.99987	So what that means is that to frame an ecosystem, I have to write a space, let us say, I don't know, just the Euclidean space with three dimension.
3186810	3194806	368	B	1.0	I have to specify time, which is like naturally in the occurrence space what we think of as time.
3194988	3204618	369	B	1.0	And I have to specify a specific way in which my system will move in space in a given step of time.
3204704	3214030	370	B	0.99971	So fear gives from any position and any time slot where the system will be if it starts from this position after the specific time duration.
3215490	3217520	371	B	0.99999	This is what a unimical system is.
3218050	3228420	372	B	0.54132	But if you have noticed this, this entails that I define preemptively all other space of possibilities of my system.
3229270	3249560	373	B	1.0	If I have a system that is open ended system of constraints, that can build new stuff, that can build language, that can build accounting, whatever new states this doesn't go, maybe you say we could reconstruct a minimal notion of new stuff happening by working.
3256090	3268732	374	A	0.79455	Sorry, I'll ask him again, Avel again repeat the last 30 seconds, but your audio is still not there.
3268786	3274552	375	A	0.99841	It's like a 30 to 42nd period where your audio just doesn't transmit.
3274616	3276110	376	A	0.97862	None of us can hear it.
3276800	3278510	377	A	0.99998	But the Internet is fine.
3280160	3283692	378	B	0.94785	Working over the dynamics of the system per se, learning the mechanical system theory.
3283756	3285090	379	B	0.99988	So you can do that either.
3286020	3286480	380	B	0.79433	Fine.
3286550	3287264	381	A	1.0	Yeah.
3287462	3288210	382	A	0.99841	Continue.
3289460	3290610	383	A	0.99	Yes, continue.
3290980	3291730	384	B	0.95245	Okay.
3293700	3302870	385	B	0.99977	So the mixture system can be written as a flow function phi over a state space x and a time parameter t.
3303800	3308408	386	B	0.99962	When you specify x you specify the total space of possibility of the system.
3308574	3315656	387	B	0.65947	So if you have a system that has opened any evolution in it well, you cannot work with a fixed space.
3315838	3324750	388	B	0.99999	You could maybe circumvent the issue by implicitly having new things happen from a change in the dynamics of the system.
3325120	3334712	389	B	0.99991	But in Mikel system theory the dynamics are pregiven through the flow function phiical system theory.
3334776	3338428	390	B	1.0	System is a specific deterministic flow.
3338524	3348470	391	B	0.99482	So you can't change the flow through time so you can't model the construction of new constraints and you can't model the emergence of new parameters that affect causality of system.
3348840	3358920	392	B	0.58466	So the FEP in of itself cannot present the creative evolution of either cognitive kinds such as money shares or constraints.
3359820	3376264	393	B	0.98	And this is where we have to get in weirder spaces formally to get something that looks like it could model open end evolution although I cannot say definitively it can because we didn't yet by construction.
3376312	3399460	394	B	0.99987	When we work with set theory which is the basic theory of mathematics which is about specific objects that are predefined we can't have what Kaufman calls adjacent possible which correspond to new evolutionary possibilities that are brought about by the evolution upon an evolution of evolutionary system like living systems.
3401480	3412372	395	B	0.99976	Simply, set theory forces you to define all of the possibilities at step one of the modeling process so can't have your system that builds new possibilities through its activity.
3412436	3416768	396	B	0.99716	This is not a coherent concept in set theory.
3416964	3417612	397	B	0.99999	However.
3417746	3436880	398	B	0.81493	What we can do is to look at, rather than set theory at a category theory which is, let us say, another approach to mathematic which looks not at specific objects and their relationship to functions but at specific spaces and their relationships to functions.
3437460	3448624	399	B	1.0	And this change in approach basically does not entail, at least not a priory that when you write a system you have to write all of the possibilities that are within the system preemptively.
3448752	3458840	400	B	0.99999	You can write a space and then look at the relationship between the space and other adjacent spaces that could correspond to adjacent possibles.
3459500	3477160	401	B	0.83	And one thing that is related to that, at least in spirit is I won't get into detail but formal approaches that allow you to build quantum state spaces from the property of quantum observation rather than the opposite.
3477320	3502020	402	B	0.5749	So simply speaking, we can look at the problem of how cognition brings about new possible not as a space of possibilities in which there is a flow but as a set of spaces in which specific events such as observation, such as enculturation, such as invention of new concepts can bring about new spaces.
3502760	3521800	403	B	1.0	And when we rewrite active inference in the language of category theory we get things that do not quite say the same thing as immaculate system theory like actual active inference, actual frenzy principle but we get things that are very very complicated.
3521880	3526936	404	B	0.99502	So the diagram that you see on the bottom left of the screen is a conecocone diagram.
3527128	3530016	405	B	1.0	I could tell you what a concoction is but I don't know.
3530038	3538560	406	B	0.99969	So I could not explain that is meant to represent the alignment in reference frame or the mutual active inference between two subsystem.
3539380	3544748	407	B	0.99342	So again, formally we have no reason to believe this can't model upon evolution.
3544924	3556388	408	B	0.99995	But also given the level of effectness of the math, we have very very few grip with which to understand what we're looking at and how this relate to specific cognitive and cultural processes.
3556564	3579840	409	B	0.99992	So there is a lot of progress to be made in that direction before we have a self standing theory of open ending cultural evolution and the basic handle of social constraints I think is a good bridge between the very concrete, very simple the immigrant system theory and the very abstract problem of many evolution.
3580340	3591490	410	B	0.9998	So let us wrap this up here and try to take out a few snippets of actionable information that was included in the talk.
3592760	3610650	411	B	1.0	First, agents by nature they engage with the world with their world as a cognitive landscape that is defined by the modalities by which they perceive the world, that is defined by the intrinsic themativity that the agent experience and that is.
3622230	3632566	412	A	0.99999	Again sorry, just go back 22 seconds but still the audio is not ready yet.
3632588	3636950	413	A	0.64742	But it's okay, we'll breathe before we jump into the conclusion.
3645380	3648370	414	A	0.49202	It okay.
3651940	3653330	415	A	0.94888	Still don't hear you.
3666170	3685040	416	A	0.6815	No, we can do the slide game where someone else presents the slide.
3685880	3687104	417	A	0.51537	Any volunteers?
3687152	3687460	418	A	0.93106	Okay.
3687530	3689030	419	A	0.96	Yeah, I heard that.
3689720	3690660	420	B	0.98552	Okay, cool.
3690730	3691588	421	A	0.69883	Can you please continue?
3691674	3692308	422	B	0.84166	No.
3692474	3696420	423	B	0.96995	Okay, we'll try to go fast because this is not agreeable.
3697480	3712408	424	B	0.99972	So one, agents engage with the world as a cognitive landscape which is defined by affordencies so minimal representation of the action that are possible in the landscape and the normativity that's embedded in the possibility of the action.
3712584	3718264	425	B	0.76	Two, the fact that humans collectively enact relatively coherent circular landscape.
3718312	3735680	426	B	0.99976	It entails that we have social constraints over collective behavior and the existence of those social constraints they enable or thought do not necessitate the emergence of higher scale agencies such as institution, organization and maybe godlike beings.
3736900	3742976	427	B	1.0	And last, the dynamics of constraints, they entail a duality between the creation of meaning.
3743008	3764044	428	B	0.99876	So the way we humans create a way to understand the world and the conception of physicals in the sense specific, concrete, causally relevant possibilities that characterize specific social cultural organizations and maybe like physical version paratuses but just don't worry about it.
3764242	3775120	429	B	1.0	And all of it is embedded in this diagram the engagement and the duality with a system of constraints that produce itself in a pen in manner.
3775460	3782380	430	B	0.9709	So a claim that I'm making on the record here is that if we understand correctly every arrow in this diagram.
3782540	3789350	431	B	0.99998	We understand culture evolution, we understand what human are, and we understand opening evolution in the cultural world.
3790120	3797620	432	B	1.0	And here I'll go through the slides in case someone needs a reference and has the time to go through the video to find the reference.
3798940	3799864	433	B	0.97057	So, thank you.
3799902	3802570	434	B	0.99	And sorry about the audio thing.
3805580	3806970	435	B	0.99932	Did this go well?
3808860	3814350	436	A	1.0	Yes, it gave some much needed silences, so it was all good.
3815440	3816236	437	A	0.99945	Cool.
3816418	3823660	438	A	0.99087	Well, first, Mao or Maria, if you would like to give any comments or reflections.
3823740	3831890	439	A	0.7245	Otherwise we can go to a few topics and then talk about how we want to conclude with the course.
3833460	3838070	440	A	0.99579	But first, Mao or Maria, do you want to say or ask anything?
3842870	3843186	441	C	0.9963	No.
3843208	3845810	442	C	0.88	I mean, this was a great summary.
3846310	3848530	443	C	0.53	I think you covered a lot of grounds.
3849450	3872220	444	C	0.99	I think, ideally, I would have liked to see how much we can do with gauge theory and how this can potentially link us to understandings of would be that would be interesting.
3880400	3880764	445	A	0.96317	Cool.
3880802	3881980	446	A	0.99993	Thank you, Maria.
3883840	3884780	447	A	0.53	All right.
3884930	3886060	448	A	0.99636	See you, Maria.
3886720	3887228	449	A	0.61029	Okay.
3887314	3897040	450	A	0.99939	Anyone in live chat can ask a question or let's first address the course question while people are writing questions.
3897110	3897724	451	A	0.99	Live chat.
3897772	3905680	452	A	0.99169	So what do you see for the coming weeks as we kind of conclude this first round?
3909240	3911670	453	B	0.9916	So you're asking me right.
3913160	3921012	454	B	0.99096	So, for a reason I do not understand, and Daniel understands, no one came up at the Mao discussion session.
3921156	3932830	455	B	0.99957	So I thought it would be interesting to push a presentation for the last session to have everyone saying that things have feedback and I have a current thing to move on from.
3933440	3947360	456	B	1.0	The question is whether you feel there is a need for a discussion that is specific for the session we have had just now, because lots of things were covered, lots of audio problems were existing.
3947940	3957372	457	B	0.97	And basically the two options are either next session is everyone presents, we give you feedback ciao, or we have a discussion session.
3957516	3966048	458	B	0.69619	So at the time that was initially planned for the conclusion, and then we have yet another session that will be the conclusion where you will make a presentation and you will get the feedback.
3966224	3974904	459	B	0.99623	So we'd like to know which is your preference, because both are very possible in my book, but doesn't show anything to me.
3974942	3976680	460	B	0.94991	So what you want is goals.
3978540	3979000	461	A	1.0	Yeah.
3979070	3980804	462	A	0.49614	Mao also open to your thoughts.
3980852	3986328	463	A	1.0	And of course, we're sharing it so that people can write in live chat or let us know in the coming days what they prefer.
3986504	3990748	464	A	0.99455	I'm down for a discussion of what we covered here.
3990914	4004544	465	A	1.0	The slides being linked and going into some of these next steps, and then a form based registration for a presentation only session so that we'll then know exactly who wants to present what.
4004582	4007716	466	A	1.0	And then we can ask how many minutes they want to do, or something like that.
4007738	4008660	467	A	0.9948	But mao?
4010840	4036824	468	C	1.0	Yeah, I think it would be good to get people who are interested in getting more active to come and make a small presentation, explain what they understood, describe the highlights for them, and potentially link it to some topic in social sciences we may not have covered here, but that they now see through a different lens.
4036872	4038270	469	C	1.0	I think that would be interesting.
4044500	4045250	470	A	0.98322	Okay.
4046420	4047072	471	A	0.86	All right.
4047126	4055270	472	A	1.0	I will look through the live chat while avoid getting some water, and then we'll ask any questions that people come up with.
4062710	4067490	473	A	0.98714	Is there ever symmetric information between or among social entities?
4073690	4080534	474	A	0.99905	Or maybe from the scripts perspective, mao or from the or however you see in relation with the constraints?
4080582	4084410	475	A	0.97	I mean, what about asymmetric constraints?
4085550	4087434	476	C	0.96861	I'm not sure I understand the question.
4087552	4092414	477	C	0.99966	Can the person give a little more detail in terms of in the questions?
4092612	4095294	478	A	0.90078	Okay, evil is back.
4095332	4101530	479	A	0.98034	But there was a question in the chat about can information ever be symmetric?
4101690	4103330	480	A	0.99996	You talked about symmetries.
4103990	4114020	481	A	0.99993	So are those symmetries in the information that two social entities have, or are they in the constraints that entities experience?
4114730	4118630	482	A	0.9998	But what are the symmetries and what are the breaks?
4121610	4131846	483	B	0.93	I would say that depending which space you model the problem information, it entails symmetry because it has to be readable.
4131958	4143360	484	B	0.99997	So you have to be a conservation between context or time of something that is considered to be the content of the information bearing thing.
4144370	4157220	485	B	0.99982	But also it is a symmetry breaking because if you take any presentation format, let's say binary, a random string means nothing, and you have to break the symmetry of the uniform expression to say something.
4157750	4162420	486	B	0.99672	So it depends very heavily on how specifically you are modeling the problem.
4162950	4185100	487	B	0.99609	But for fundamental reasons, any mathematical representation, it depends on the implicit model of the symmetries of the system because you won't present things that do not matter, but you have to present things that do matter, and then you have a very uncomfortable amount of freedom over how you want to present any single thing.
4190030	4203460	488	A	0.99998	Certainly this comes up in learning active inference and in talking about it like what you described, how many ways there are to model a given thing which is related to which symmetries are preserved, as you mentioned.
4204150	4214930	489	A	0.99987	So how do we reckon with that space and with the different ways of representing the same social setting?
4216410	4236454	490	B	0.99982	So a reason why I'm not quite comfortable with the notion of information is that in all possible settings where I define quantum information theory as not possible because very few people overall think about it, information will be a probability distribution.
4236502	4243210	491	B	0.99998	It will be like functional over probability submission that is minus to the logarithm of the probability.
4243290	4245360	492	B	0.58847	That is what self information is.
4245970	4250682	493	B	1.0	And this is defined over a probability distribution.
4250826	4253550	494	B	0.82872	Distribution is defined over state space.
4253700	4257090	495	B	0.99994	So implicitly information entails differential state space.
4257240	4267010	496	B	0.99985	So if you want to work over things that are prior to state spaces, you cannot work with information in any coherent definition.
4271770	4288378	497	B	0.99952	Basically, the one thing you could do that is vaguely inspired from work in quantum information theory, mainly by Christopher first is to not look at the probability, but at the sorry, not to look at the information.
4288544	4305118	498	B	0.95558	I'm using that term in a colloquial way now because I have to switch meaning information not as a property of the dispersion but as a property of quantum operator that corresponds to observation and that embeds.
4305134	4317480	499	B	0.99575	Basically, we could say again, in a very, very colloquial sense, something akin to an expectation or a measurement or a synchronization event in the active inference model.
4318090	4331980	500	B	0.98	And this for a specific type of operator, for a specific type of spaces, you can get basically the space that flows from the operator rather than the other way around.
4332350	4342026	501	B	0.99	And then information is like it's not colmogo rough complexity, it's not shaman information, it's not a variant of entropy.
4342138	4350490	502	B	0.99994	It is basically what is hypothesized by these specific operators that you use to interact with matter and with cultural and material environments.
4350650	4355394	503	B	1.0	And maybe there is a big maybe here, I should say maybe one more time.
4355512	4373750	504	B	0.95129	Maybe this can adapt it in some way to account for the process of ankuration, where basically the process angulation is considered as the integration of specific reference frames, like expectation colloquially.
4374410	4390240	505	B	1.0	And this entail the evolution of the cognitive landscape and our social constraints either defined over the cognitive landscape or defined as a self standing mathematical object, I do not know.
4391170	4406878	506	B	0.99983	But if we have that, and if we have a decent level of understanding of what constraints the evolution of neurofence frames, we have a selfcending theory of the unfolding of creative landscapes and of open ended culture evolution.
4406974	4409202	507	B	1.0	This is a sufficient condition, I am sure of that.
4409336	4411540	508	B	0.99998	But it is very hard to reach.
4415190	4421954	509	B	1.0	There are so many threads by which you could take it and each one is like the level of postdoc in mathematics.
4422002	4426802	510	B	1.0	And I'm not talking about 19th century mathematics, but talking about algebraic topology.
4426866	4432314	511	B	0.99993	I'm talking about weird category thing that people only figured out how to define 30 years ago.
4432432	4436634	512	B	0.81099	So yeah, I'm not confident I will give you an answer to that within five years.
4436672	4437770	513	B	0.99945	I'm not confident.
4440850	4443086	514	A	0.98285	Wow, very interesting there.
4443188	4445402	515	A	0.94	All right, some questions from the chat.
4445466	4455730	516	A	0.9927	So, first upcycle, Club wrote do you think ritualized storytelling is driven by social constraints?
4456550	4458526	517	B	0.99908	Everything is driven by circumstraints.
4458558	4462130	518	B	0.99982	We just define circumstraints as the contrast that exist over behavior.
4463750	4473142	519	B	1.0	If we expect that every night we have to go around the fire and listen to someone tell a story, then yeah, this will happen.
4473196	4480540	520	B	1.0	If we expect that we have to go on YouTube and listen to talks about abstract things such as inference, this will happen.
4481070	4487718	521	B	0.99866	So in this sense, everything, every single activity you have is embedded in landscape or cultural expectation.
4487894	4502590	522	B	0.99	And this is why it's pretty hard to talk about basic mechanism of cultural transmission because whichever cognitive mechanism you are looking at is encultured and could in principle and likely has been a few times changed by cultural evolution.
4504950	4505700	523	B	1.0	Yes.
4507670	4508082	524	A	0.99999	Cool.
4508136	4526930	525	A	1.0	And that takes me back to the scripts discussion in papers, the strong script at exactly this time here's the script that we're all going to read from on through the spaces of weaker scripts like we tend to meet here or there happens to be a path here.
4527100	4527770	526	A	0.9807	Okay.
4527920	4530666	527	A	0.99975	So then some comments from M.
4530688	4531530	528	A	0.3909	Lenin.
4531870	4534250	529	A	0.6	One, thank you.
4534400	4540410	530	A	1.0	I don't know if making a presentation to explain what one understood is an attractive invitation.
4540850	4544270	531	A	0.98211	Still, two places I did not track as well as I hope was.
4544340	4556002	532	A	1.0	One, dissolution of agency as we know it and two, the informational geometry among agent, environment and boundary went over my head.
4556056	4556820	533	A	0.99993	Thank you.
4559460	4564720	534	A	0.96236	So dissolution of agency and agent, environment, boundary.
4565220	4565980	535	B	1.0	Yes.
4566150	4568260	536	B	0.58	I will get back to the slides.
4569800	4571380	537	B	0.9998	Are you seeing the window?
4575480	4577412	538	A	1.0	Yeah, I'll bring it in.
4577466	4577924	539	A	0.99693	That's fine.
4577962	4578710	540	A	0.99999	Thank you.
4580440	4581190	541	B	0.99467	Okay.
4584620	4606610	542	B	0.52265	So the dissolution of agency is basically the idea that when we think about agents, people like we think as a system that has a body and that has a brain and that has the ability for discursion, like deliberating over what you do and not do.
4607140	4611676	543	B	0.51	And we place agency at the level of discursive beliefs.
4611788	4625140	544	B	0.99995	So if I say I want to grab the water and I grab the water, I grab the water out of my agency, if I inadvertently, I don't know, bump into something and make it fall or grab without thinking about it, is it attentive?
4627000	4628256	545	B	0.55223	Most people would say yes.
4628298	4631560	546	B	0.9987	But that's actually not entailed by the most used model of agency.
4632460	4643070	547	B	0.71872	Legally speaking, you are held as not responsible or less responsible of things that you did not have the opportunity to debate over.
4643520	4666080	548	B	0.9998	But from a purely cognitive perspective and if the active inference model is correct, the bulk of the intentionality of your ability to direct your own flow that you have does not come from reasoning and deliberation and central executive system like cognitive function that we associate with reasoning and agency.
4666920	4688600	549	B	0.99975	It comes from the basic expectation you have yourself and the world because your expectation over the world constraint heavily implicate the opportunities for action that you perceive and your beliefs over yourself constrain just as heavily the options that you will end up pursuing.
4688940	4700750	550	B	0.61	And so the agency, your ability to decide of stuff, it mostly reduces to predictive process over your self model and your world model.
4701360	4718188	551	B	1.0	And this is while not like I don't see any problem formally or empirically with that picture as I understand it, that comes very well for the neuropsychiatric and psychological literature and sociological literature.
4718284	4728704	552	B	0.56206	Like this is good, this works scientifically, but this is counterintuitive because again, most people will expect you to have reasoning and then to decide of stuff and then to execute all the stuff you decide.
4728832	4731990	553	B	1.0	Which again, I don't think this happens.
4732680	4741390	554	B	0.99529	So harder question is the information geometry, I kind of glossed over it because yeah.
4742320	4743516	555	B	0.99913	So the.
4743538	4750456	556	B	0.99956	Information geometry is a geometry that is defined within his incode system, equipped with a partition, blah, blah, blah.
4750648	4760240	557	B	1.0	And so by a geometry, I mean basically a space of curvature that exists over your bezel space.
4760310	4766192	558	B	0.8566	This is basically the same thing that I'm presenting in the bottom left of the screen.
4766246	4772644	559	B	0.70945	Here you have a space that is your normal space, where you see stuff happen, which is represented here by the line.
4772842	4781640	560	B	1.0	And you have a curvature that is defined by some of the things that are defined over the space and by the Frenzy principle.
4782220	4802540	561	B	0.99871	When you have this partition condition that is verified, then each state in the agent internal states, like each specific point, it can be corresponds to a belief distribution over the states of the environment.
4803440	4808284	562	B	1.0	And so this is in this sense that we have an information geometry like we have a geometry.
4808332	4815970	563	B	0.99984	So curvature over space, where the space is the internal state of the agent, and the geometry is belief over ethical states.
4817000	4827140	564	B	0.99	And furthermore, this matters because the agent isn't actually constrained by the image.
4829100	4846460	565	B	1.0	The agent is effectively constrained by the geometry in such a way that its internal flow optimizes the bias and coherence of the belief that exists according to the geometry.
4847360	4855900	566	B	0.99276	So this is highly math, this is straightforward, but lots of words, lots of section.
4856260	4858768	567	B	0.99586	No real visual aid, put it.
4858854	4865120	568	B	0.99989	So this is more something to read about and something to hear about, which is why I glossed over it.
4865190	4869140	569	B	0.99986	But I hope going over it again brings a bit more of clarity.
4874900	4880808	570	A	0.99999	How would you connect what you just said to the differences with written and oral culture?
4881004	4882960	571	A	0.93813	Like, what is hearable?
4883040	4884260	572	A	0.99995	What is seeable?
4884840	4897370	573	A	0.99993	How does writing in the printed or etched or digitized form relate to how you discussed culture today?
4900940	4902244	574	B	1.0	I see you as frozen.
4902292	4904090	575	B	0.43797	Danielle, can you hear me?
4905900	4907212	576	A	1.0	I can hear you.
4907346	4907976	577	A	0.67469	Mao.
4908088	4912030	578	B	0.59951	Okay, so do answer, or do Mao answer?
4912480	4913996	579	A	0.89725	Mao, if you want to.
4914178	4914860	580	A	0.99	Yeah, please.
4914930	4922464	581	C	1.0	I can give a little bit of an idea, but effectively, we're talking about precision and temporality, right?
4922502	4938150	582	C	0.93171	So writing and discourse, the discourse has to relate to pragmatics, and the discourse is likely to be interpreted because it has lower precision than, say, writing has over time.
4939080	4961704	583	C	0.99991	So here you're talking about the ways in which the information geometry will be bent and shifted through the precision of the embedded of the embedded normativity that is given rise to through these markers that you can point to over and over and over with high precision.
4961832	4963310	584	C	1.0	I think that's the link.
4966400	4967150	585	B	0.98794	Basically.
4968480	4982096	586	B	0.61	So when I talked about role taking and language, I claim that the core reason why this matter is because this enforce coherence between the cognitive landscape experienced by agents and writing changes massively the scale at which it is possible.
4982278	4988032	587	B	1.0	And it changes massively the level of emotional embeddedness of language.
4988096	4997960	588	B	0.99977	It is much lower in speech than sorry, much higher in speech than it is in writing, especially if you account for singing as a form of speech.
4998620	5006968	589	B	0.99988	So historically writing very clearly and very ambiguously powered the rise of administration.
5007064	5021440	590	B	0.98379	So states so organization that do a lot of accounting and bookkeeping like book is literally in the word and that enable the centralization of resource management.
5022020	5029730	591	B	0.99993	This is explained in detail in the logic of writing by Goody Goody.
5030340	5043190	592	B	0.61	And yeah, basically this writing is a core cultural innovation that enables centralized policies, city states, things like that.
5046540	5048410	593	A	0.99	Yeah, that's very interesting.
5049580	5068844	594	A	0.99721	So one topic Avel that we've discussed and maybe you could unpack a little bit here is thinking of culture and these cognitive ecosystems leads to consideration of the cognitive security or of different information risk aspects.
5068892	5076130	595	A	0.99914	So where does that come into play with the formalism or what you discussed here?
5077380	5092900	596	B	0.76773	So, from a cognitive security aspect, one thing you can read in the formalism quite directly is that if you control the environment as in the cognitive landscape experienced by agent, you control what the agent do directly.
5093740	5101384	597	B	0.72497	So there are two things that are very stereotypically associated with cognitive security.
5101502	5105888	598	B	0.99993	This is Russian propaganda, not quite propaganda.
5105924	5134880	599	B	0.98243	Cognitive warfare campaigns pretty much around the world more generally the propaganda that is used by authoritarian regimes to get stuff going and the cults that historically are tied to the worry of brain control by evil cults that can control you from afar like you had a telecommand.
5135400	5142596	600	B	1.0	And so in both cases actually, let us get back a bit.
5142698	5156090	601	B	0.99997	When you are a state that does propaganda and when you are a state you can do a lot of material engineering so producing the environmental states in which people live in.
5156400	5173730	602	B	0.96	And for example, if you look at the city of Brazilia, which is one of the very few specifically built capital city that exists in the world, there is like one in there is Brazilian and there is like maybe four others.
5174260	5179436	603	B	0.99	And those cities are basically very big, glorified administrative centers.
5179628	5190608	604	B	0.97	And Brazilian in particular, it has neighborhoods for work, neighborhoods for leisure, neighborhoods for habitation.
5190704	5201192	605	B	0.99916	It is extremely divided and because of this dividedness you basically don't get to do stuff that are not work or hang out with your family.
5201326	5202852	606	B	0.99931	That is not a possibility.
5202996	5211980	607	B	0.99	And of course this changed massively the way people experience their life and this change massively the topology of this network that can emerge.
5212800	5230210	608	B	0.99613	But when you are doing cognitive warfare in the sense that NATO defines so you are state or state organization and you are trying to fuck with another state or state organization you don't get to just build cities that are bad but it's not possibility that you have.
5230660	5242660	609	B	0.99876	So what the Russians do in a systematic way is to try to basically create dots over what information is reliable so that people feel paralyzed.
5243400	5247368	610	B	1.0	The target, I must insist critically is not the information that is available.
5247454	5253064	611	B	0.99956	It shows that people can have the actionability that the people can give to the information.
5253262	5262232	612	B	1.0	And so they tend to propagate a lot of conspiracy theory nonsense because it occupies a lot of space and it prevents the possibility for public debates to occur.
5262376	5282208	613	B	0.87	And another strategy they use is to manipulate the personal identity that are embedded often in ethnicity or in the case of the US advanced countries where political life is mostly decoupled from ethnicity.
5282304	5285972	614	B	0.98	And I understand the irony to say that this is the case in the US.
5286106	5294436	615	B	0.93374	But you don't have ethnically specific parties or armed forces, so this is less the case than elsewhere.
5294548	5314380	616	B	0.98507	So in these countries they will use political identity, so they will use republican identity or leftist identity, but mostly republican identity to just push complete nonsense and get people to act in a way that overall destabilizes the grip of the US over their own population.
5315120	5321276	617	B	0.98	And so this is the basic way that we do connective warfare.
5321308	5329010	618	B	1.0	And you can understand this in terms of social constraints because again, the target is not like information in of itself.
5330420	5336944	619	B	0.94507	It's the possibility that is afforded by the social context in which we evolve at an instant.
5337072	5341568	620	B	0.97	The goal is to create doubts and noise in the public setting.
5341664	5346520	621	B	0.5492	It's rate constraints that are not compatible with efficient collective organization.
5347740	5366780	622	B	1.0	And a way where you do it is when you see it being done in a much more systematic and efficient way is of course with intra state influence where state administrators and state institutions, they try to create grip over a population.
5367280	5380370	623	B	1.0	And if you look at the birth of nationalism like we have the notion today that nations are somewhat coherent political groups that let us say the French hang out together and take decision together.
5381160	5389584	624	B	0.99943	This notion, it's not quite recent, strictly speaking, but the fact that it's dominant, that it is just a standard expectation, is very recent.
5389632	5406600	625	B	1.0	And it derives from the French that somehow where a group of administrators somehow managed to convince everyone that they shared identity and they shared mutual obligation, responsibility in virtue of this identity.
5407120	5423756	626	B	0.99	And the way in which this happens is they sent instituters in villages and they sent soldiers and the children had to listen to the instituters explain to them that they were French and they needed to do French things like going to war for France.
5423868	5429308	627	B	0.51	And if you did not let the children do that, you went to prison.
5429404	5431280	628	B	1.0	And no one wants to go to prison.
5432920	5437350	629	B	1.0	Of course, I'm doing a very huge caricature here.
5437800	5441510	630	B	0.99466	There is not a shadowy set of influence that sense.
5442680	5444740	631	B	0.99995	This is an overspecification.
5444820	5458728	632	B	0.97903	But what happened is that the French state managed to create a social niche up in a very very foreign villages where French hood became a basic condition of existence.
5458904	5470936	633	B	0.99997	Most of your social thing, the fact that you were legally recognized as existing, the activities or activities that you had lot of those were embedded in your perception of being French.
5471128	5481664	634	B	0.63	And so when this is the case and when you see that administration tends to be on top of things, administration tells you you have to go to war in virtue of your freshness, then you go to war.
5481702	5484044	635	B	0.93229	You don't fight against the administration.
5484092	5501368	636	B	0.9989	You fight against whoever administration tells you fact that you have agreed implicitly that you are French beforehand makes this lot harder to resist basically than if the state just sent soldier at you and kidnapped you and gave you a swear until you fight.
5501534	5503960	637	B	0.99999	This is not how you make things efficient.
5504540	5506404	638	B	0.97569	Army Ras this way are unorganized.
5506452	5508250	639	B	0.99994	They are unmotivated, they are not good.
5508620	5516744	640	B	0.91	And if you want people to have stakes, you need to give them power or you need to give them the impression they have power because they are French.
5516792	5517212	641	B	1.0	And here.
5517266	5520416	642	B	0.64579	French Governs things.
5520518	5526416	643	B	1.0	And whether you are in the set of French that actually direct things or not, bad question to ask.
5526518	5528560	644	B	1.0	Just go to the trenches.
5529060	5538550	645	B	0.99	And this type of things we would not think as cognitive warfare because we would not think as between.
5539480	5544272	646	B	0.55538	Implicitly, when we talk about warfare, we talk about between states or between nation conflict.
5544336	5547384	647	B	0.58	And this is within a nation, within a social group.
5547502	5553240	648	B	0.99916	But you can look at cults and how they create social influence.
5553820	5561020	649	B	0.99957	You can look at, for example, one of the most famous cults that existed, which is the Munis or the Unification Church.
5562800	5566392	650	B	0.99777	They were widely accused to make brainwashing.
5566456	5570156	651	B	0.97817	They were accused to somehow control people and make them do things they don't want to do.
5570178	5570984	652	B	0.70257	That is not a possibility.
5571032	5575424	653	B	0.97035	You have an organization like you cannot kidnap people and hope that it will be okay.
5575462	5578208	654	B	0.54645	You will get killed by police if you do that.
5578294	5579760	655	B	0.99984	Most likely in the US.
5579910	5584976	656	B	0.9996	In this specific space where the education church evolved.
5585088	5593930	657	B	0.9989	What you can do is to create a context where you have a huge grip over what people can and cannot say, what they can and cannot think about themselves.
5594300	5605028	658	B	0.99991	You can tell them that your leader is the coming of Jesus that is going to bring everyone in paradise.
5605204	5617900	659	B	1.0	And you can make people go to work sessions, talk about it and you can just physically cling to those people all the time until you are quite confident that they feel that whatever you are doing is important.
5618050	5626284	660	B	0.98	And you can have very big emotional ritual where everyone cries and become extremely embedded in the group membership.
5626412	5636492	661	B	1.0	And you can be extremely supportive of group members while being extremely aggressive to anything that go away from group identity.
5636556	5643260	662	B	1.0	And when you process this environment and people and goats in this environment for a long time, they tend to develop this group identity.
5643440	5657980	663	B	0.99892	So when you tell them the big leader tells you to give us €20,000 for your ancestors not to go to hell, that seems reasonable.
5658400	5671664	664	B	0.9933	That seems like a reasonable ask, which it would not unless you had a very tight control over the social environment of someone because then it's not just giving money in exchange for a good.
5671702	5678160	665	B	0.99961	This is about upholding your self identity as someone who follows and believes the culture.
5679060	5686096	666	B	0.52	And yet again, this is something that is formalized directly in terms of constraints because this is about what you can and cannot do in a given social context.
5686128	5690516	667	B	0.99998	This is not about abstract beliefs, it's not about brain control.
5690618	5696040	668	B	0.99851	It's not about anything but what you can and cannot do in a given social context.
5700650	5702262	669	A	1.0	All right, there was a ton there.
5702396	5706214	670	A	0.89214	Let me kind of retrace a few of the pieces that I heard there.
5706252	5720140	671	A	0.99707	So towards framing cognitive security under this cognitive constraint framework that you're discussing, for which active inference under the free energy principle is the process theory that gets it done.
5720510	5737378	672	A	1.0	First you described how modern states have a lot of administrative capacity and affordances, especially through writing and especially again in the last decades and centuries of information environment changes.
5737544	5748530	673	A	1.0	And then you pointed to two kind of patterns or genres or motifs of influence or cognitive warfare, propaganda and cults discussed.
5748690	5754390	674	A	1.0	One example of them surely could have gone into more detail, or there's other examples and perspectives and so on.
5754540	5763846	675	A	0.8	And as Mao alluded to earlier, precision modulation is a key aspect of constraint.
5763878	5773514	676	A	1.0	I mean, precision modulation of how tightly you're holding the baseball bat, the movement, its precision in wobble is going to be related to the grasp.
5773642	5781434	677	A	1.0	And so increasing uncertainty can lead to anxiety and doubt.
5781482	5784006	678	A	1.0	All of that's very wrapped up in a narrative setting.
5784138	5798034	679	A	0.9986	Then you discussed how there's a ratcheting of thinking and acting like a state breaking symmetries like states do, and getting grasp over the subject, over the citizen.
5798082	5811302	680	A	0.99997	That's a complex topic, but that's what you went and then there are asymmetries around control of the environment, the information environment, ability to read, write, edit in the information environment.
5811446	5828830	681	A	1.0	And that leads to these engineered distributions of what is important or what means what, which justifies or even writes the blank check for requests of funds, whatever the narrative is around those funds.
5829490	5848390	682	A	0.99984	But more fundamentally, those strategies can threaten sense making, which is to say the inbound perceptual component of active inference, and then also decision making and action selection, which is the fundamental complement the outbound aspect of active inference.
5851610	5853222	683	A	0.96394	I'll read another comment from the Live.
5853276	5853606	684	A	0.73	Oh yeah?
5853628	5855000	685	A	0.99517	Do you want to add anything else on?
5855850	5870570	686	B	0.90928	Like, I'd like to point out a very specific example that is contemporary, which is the campaign by Israel to remove people from the Gaza band.
5871310	5873934	687	B	0.75605	So just I don't know when people will watch it.
5873972	5891726	688	B	0.9997	So on the 7 October, 11 days ago, Hamas, which is a terrorist organization, Islamist organization that is dominant in the Gazaban, attacked Israeli and slaughtered IRA settlers that were nearby and slaughtered tourists that were nearby and attacked military bases.
5891758	5894050	689	B	0.99874	They made, I think, 2000 deaths.
5896410	5921930	690	B	0.98	The state of Israel that is currently led by very far right parties, things that we would not have equivalent of in Europe or the US has decided to answer by blaming each individual Palestinian for this and trying to deport them like this is not itself.
5922000	5937118	691	B	0.99562	What I'm trying to comment about what I'm trying to comment about is that every single comment you will see about it on Twitter makes the confusion between Hamas and Palestinian on one side and Netanyahu and the Israeli on the other side.
5937284	5948280	692	B	0.99	And so this produces a framing that says basically people are trying to decide whether the AMAs action are justified or not.
5948730	5952242	693	B	0.99	And implicitly in this debate, they create a context.
5952386	5961000	694	B	0.79879	Wherever group lose the GMAC debate gets to be killed to the last.
5961930	5979178	695	B	0.98	And so you produce very, very basically that produce a framing that makes the only possibility in the conflict extermination, because each side this is not two side dynamic.
5979194	5989650	696	B	0.99988	There is no Palestinian and there is the Israeli and there is the I will not make all the relation but by this framing.
5990310	5995010	697	B	0.52989	Like the framing that either the Arabs or the Jew must prevail and kill the other.
5995160	6009590	698	B	0.99996	You give a lot of power for groups to just make this a genocidal war and justify things like cutting water to 1 million people because like, 200 of them committed massacre.
6010410	6015194	699	B	0.99	And I do not know if there is a single actor that tried to get this.
6015232	6017018	700	B	0.68	I do not think this is the case.
6017184	6025040	701	B	0.99977	But this is a very powerful instance of how procrang that does not need to target what you believe, but it does need to target how you frame problems.
6031670	6032274	702	A	0.82	Yeah.
6032392	6034530	703	A	0.8266	Lot to say on that.
6034680	6040180	704	A	0.99987	Any last pieces you want to discuss?
6043110	6044420	705	B	0.99992	No, it is good.
6045590	6046770	706	B	0.76	I have talked a lot.
6046840	6050300	707	B	0.99762	I'd like to stop talking you.
6052270	6054874	708	A	0.94689	Okay, well, thank you.
6055072	6064138	709	A	0.99978	We will send out updates to people about the coming weeks, so thank you.
6064224	6066250	710	A	0.98	All right, bye.
6066990	6067850	711	B	0.66176	Ciao.
6068350	6070410	712	B	0.99977	Thanks for your attention.
6070990	6071590	713	B	0.99715	Goodbye.
