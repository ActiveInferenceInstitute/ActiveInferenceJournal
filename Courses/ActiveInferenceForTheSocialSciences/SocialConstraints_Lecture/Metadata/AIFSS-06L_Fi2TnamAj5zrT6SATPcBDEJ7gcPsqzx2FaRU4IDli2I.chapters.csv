4770	112870	00:04	Avel Gwenin Carlos lecture, Social Constraints and the Excess Central Stance What Makes US Human. We'll talk of social constraints, of the existential stance, and of what makes us human. If you have any questions, please feel free to add them in the live chat.	Avel Gwenin Carlos: Social constraints and what makes us human	Active Inference for the Social Sciences
113770	675630	01:53	Culture is typically used in one of three ways. It can be information or behavior required socially. The mechanisms of social learning in humans are culturally transmitted. Things that do work directly to produce culture are language and role taking.	Culture can be information or behavior required socially	What is culture in humans?
676930	873200	11:16	Active inference is a theory of cognition where basically agents enact expectation of the world. A core feature of this approach is the dissolution of agency as we typically understand it. Our action are not constrained by will in a joke case, they are constrained by what looks more like self model.	Active inference is a theory of cognition where agents enact expectation of the world	Inactive Inference of Clear Landscape
877750	1489340	14:37	When you are a skilled agent, you experience the world as represented space in 3D with 3D models in it. What you see is a landscape of basic opportunities for action. We come to experience world as a world of affordances and this is the same for the social world.	Skill intentionality theory stands at the interface between active inference and ecological psychology	Active Inference and Willful Action
1493710	1657640	24:53	Language and role taking seem to be pretty robust candidates to explain the coherence of a shared cultural landscape. It forces you to have a synchronization between what you experience as possibilities for action and what you expect are cultural expectation over behavior. There are things that exist only in the one species that has full fledged, cumulative, open ended cultural evolution.	Language and role taking help enforce shared cultural landscape between agents	What Makes Us Human?
1659050	2653874	27:39	There is a thing called biological autonomy where you get a set of constraints that collectively produce itself. A constraint is simply a relatively slow physical process that shapes a faster process. There is an opportunity to model emerging agent from collective network activity. This is applicable very straightforwardly to the human species.	To account for perinetric culture evolution, constraints must change over time	Cultural Landscape and the dynamics of enculturation
2654072	3376264	44:14	Most things in physics can be framed as simply symmetries over system dynamics. A Gold theory is simply elaborate instance of this core ID. The core feature of gauge theory is to take the geometry of that problem and make it into a physical force. If active inference frames a gauge theory for enculturation.	In physics we frame physical problem around symmetries symmetry	Gauge Theory 6, Active Inference
3376312	3579840	56:16	When we work with set theory we can't have what Kaufman calls adjacent possible which correspond to new evolutionary possibilities. What we can do is to look at, rather than set theory at a category theory which looks at specific spaces and their relationships to functions. There is a lot of progress to be made before we have a self standing theory of cultural evolution.	When we work with set theory which is about specific objects that are predefined	Immaculate System Theory and Cultural Evolution
3580340	3814350	59:40	Agents engage with the world as a cognitive landscape defined by affordencies. It entails that we have social constraints over collective behavior. If we understand correctly every arrow in this diagram, we understand culture evolution. And sorry about the audio thing. Did this go well?	So let us wrap this up here and try to take out some actionable information	A Cognitive Landscape and the Dynamics of Conclusions
3815440	3887228	1:03:35	Cool. Well, first, Mao or Maria, if you would like to give any comments or reflections. I think, ideally, I would have liked to see how much we can do with gauge theory. See you, Maria.	Mao or Maria, if you have any comments or reflections	A Summary of the Course
3887314	4055270	1:04:47	Anyone in live chat can ask a question or let's first address the course question while people are writing questions. What do you see for the coming weeks as we kind of conclude this first round? Two options are either next session is everyone presents, we give you feedback ciao, or we have a discussion session.	Daniel: We have two options for concluding this first round of discussions	A few thoughts on the first round
4062710	4443086	1:07:42	Is there ever symmetric information between or among social entities? Or maybe from the scripts perspective, mao or from the or however you see in relation with the constraints?	Is there ever symmetric information between or among social entities	Can Information Ever Be Symmetric?
4443188	4526930	1:14:03	Everything is driven by circumstraints. If we expect that every night we have to go around the fire and listen to someone tell a story, then yeah, this will happen. In this sense, everything, every single activity you have is embedded in landscape or cultural expectation.	Club says ritualized storytelling is driven by social constraints	How Storytelling is Driven by Social Constraints
4527100	4731990	1:15:27	The dissolution of agency as we know it and the informational geometry among agent, environment and boundary went over my head. The agency, your ability to decide of stuff, it mostly reduces to predictive process over your self model and your world model.	Two places where dissolution of agency as we know it went over my head	Dissolution of Agency and its implications
4732680	4869140	1:18:52	Information geometry is a geometry that is defined within his incode system. When you have this partition condition that is verified, then each state in the agent internal states can be corresponds to a belief distribution over the environment. The agent is effectively constrained by the geometry in such a way that its internal flow optimizes the belief that exists according to the geometry.	Information geometry is a geometry that is defined within his incode system	Information Geometry and the Sharpe principle
4874900	5048410	1:21:14	How would you connect what you just said to the differences with written and oral culture? How does writing in the printed or etched or digitized form relate to how you discussed culture today?	Danielle: How does writing relate to how we discuss culture today	How does writing and culture relate to one another?
5049580	5696040	1:24:09	Avel: If you control the environment as in the cognitive landscape experienced by agent, you control what the agent do directly. This is Russian propaganda, not quite propaganda. The target is not the information that is available. It's the possibility that is afforded by the social context in which we evolve at an instant.	Cognitive security is the ability to control the environment experienced by agent	Cognitive Security and Information Warfare
5700650	6034530	1:35:00	Peter Bergen: framing cognitive security under the free energy principle is the process theory that gets it done. He says there are asymmetries around control of the environment, the information environment, ability to read, write, edit. Those strategies can threaten sense making, he says. Bergen says this is a powerful example of how procrang can frame problems.	You discuss cognitive security under cognitive constraint framework	Cognitive Warfare and the Israel debate
6034680	6071590	1:40:34	Any last pieces you want to discuss? No, it is good. I'd like to stop talking you. We will send out updates to people about the coming weeks. All right, bye.	Any last pieces you want to discuss? No, it is good. I'd like to stop talking you. Thanks for your attention. We will	A message about the coming weeks
