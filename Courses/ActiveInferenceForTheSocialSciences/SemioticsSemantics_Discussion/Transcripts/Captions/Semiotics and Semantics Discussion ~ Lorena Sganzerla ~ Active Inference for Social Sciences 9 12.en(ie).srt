1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,140
foreign

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,019
it is September 12 2023 we're here in

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,000
the active inference for the social

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,220
sciences course at the Active inference

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,039
Institute and having a discussion

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,000
section on semiotics and semantics here

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,340
with Lorena secancerla

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,140
we're going to be having a fun

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,359
discussion I hope if you're watching

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,640
live please feel free to write any

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,760
questions in the live chat if

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,440
you thought about joining you are sure

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,899
it's not too late otherwise we're gonna

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,200
pick up on some key points from the

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
lecture and on the topic and see where

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,000
we go so

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,379
Lorena

18
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,860
welcome back

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,640
and

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,680
however you want to begin let's go from

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,300
there

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,320
okay hello thank you Daniel

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,280
um

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,299
so let's try to recap a little bit where

25
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,060
we left off in during the lecture

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,960
um

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,920
just to remind us where we were like my

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,360
point what I was trying to articulate uh

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,659
was the idea of

30
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,580
what does it mean to talk about a formal

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,960
semantics in a way that is not really

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,700
loaded because

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,540
it's an interesting thought like to have

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,460
a semantic

35
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,979
semantics that is actually only formal

36
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,520
right in principle it would be

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,659
relative to meaningful

38
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,899
uh to meaning right in in the notion

39
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,000
that

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,880
active inference

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,540
is trying to cash it out

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,540
he

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,439
is it's more like an idea or a way of

44
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,899
modeling how

45
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,420
how we deal with meaningful situations

46
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,920
and she understand that in a more

47
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,239
interesting more embodied and more

48
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,780
concrete way I was suggesting that we

49
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,180
could use

50
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,080
biosemiotics as

51
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,739
uh

52
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,120
as a model and as a theory who

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,560
living creatures like language users to

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,319
navigate the realm of symbols

55
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,239
and give one example which came from

56
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,920
uh James Koch which is the European

57
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,640
forestry that comes with a practice

58
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,680
understanding this scientific

59
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,080
understanding of forests as a practice

60
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,920
that me that allows us to

61
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,099
to refer to meaningful

62
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,019
too meaningful things in the environment

63
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,080
in terms of what is valuable what's

64
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,260
interesting and what is not

65
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,159
and

66
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,959
what interestingly what is more

67
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,879
important also from what becomes

68
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,360
valuable it is what

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,680
is

70
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,560
cropped out from

71
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,220
eliminating for perspective so things

72
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,299
natural uh parts of nature becomes left

73
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,340
out or understood as something that is

74
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,799
not desirable and you just understand

75
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,379
what you don't want in your

76
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,780
articulating Principle as weeds or

77
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,519
something that you should

78
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,159
get rid of

79
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,159
in respect to what is more desirable in

80
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,400
terms of crowds and how you understand

81
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,780
nature in a more

82
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,680
commoditized way

83
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,220
and I find like this example from God

84
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,960
kind of very very

85
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,960
elucidating

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,259
uh in in the book he creates this in the

87
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,060
book he's talking about States how we

88
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,020
articulate life around one specific

89
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,199
notion of stage but in this specific

90
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,800
example he has the idea of one official

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
Observer and this official Observer

92
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,580
establishes a principle of meaning

93
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,340
in a way

94
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,220
you have to have a handle of nature

95
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,160
and that also articulates how

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,400
Villages and how

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,960
practices around Agriculture and

98
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,759
and how people relate to each other

99
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,340
within these practices gets organized

100
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,780
specifically for uh one interesting

101
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,840
point that he makes that is

102
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,880
to appreciate

103
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,000
the constriction of that is like a

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,419
vision that notices not what within the

105
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,699
meaningful crops but we just left

106
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,100
outside the field of vision

107
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,220
and I bring that specifically to

108
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,520
understand how

109
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,120
for different principle can

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,660
or could be connected to a generalized

111
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,400
synchronization

112
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,020
over time

113
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,120
in relation to those symbols and those

114
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,820
practices in terms of Niche Construction

115
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,780
and

116
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,639
how those

117
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,639
how this Niche construction brings along

118
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,680
with the symbolic

119
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,139
and use of

120
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,780
language a predictive value

121
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,979
thank you friend wanna

122
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,199
bring up any thoughts on that or any

123
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,280
other

124
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,380
pieces or I'm happy to add a comment

125
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,740
Brynn

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,740
okay

127
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,780
okay

128
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,900
um

129
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,060
a lot to say there there was a little

130
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,800
bit of a double play with what is

131
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,280
cropped on one hand what is cropped is

132
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,139
the industrial crop that is being

133
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,120
prepared

134
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,620
and

135
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,419
um and then the other side of that coin

136
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,220
is what is cropped out

137
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,460
and what what we crop in is the part

138
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,380
that we're paying attention to and we

139
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,900
can't pay attention to everything so

140
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,240
it's it's like two sides the same coin

141
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,539
what we pay attention to what we include

142
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,500
in attention in our cognitive awareness

143
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,479
leaves the shadow which is what we

144
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,860
exclude

145
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,340
and um that could be like the weeds or

146
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,220
the other ecosystem services so by

147
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,800
highlighting the meaning or one

148
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,960
dimension of meaning or one stance on

149
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,580
meaning

150
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,880
that only it's like a seesaw that

151
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,220
becomes Salient to the extent that

152
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,660
something else

153
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,419
must be de-prioritized

154
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,880
so that's how we accentuate these

155
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,560
distributions of meaning

156
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,500
and what do we get from active inference

157
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,500
and and free energy principle beyond for

158
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,960
example what's provided in seeing like a

159
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,639
state

160
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,199
I think there's a lot we could say on

161
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,740
that but one piece is we get a process

162
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,000
Theory

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,919
a real procedural approach to how

164
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,740
different systems come to

165
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,080
do sense making and cognition and action

166
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,458
so just describing the lay of the land

167
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:40,559
or the history of Forestry in Europe or

168
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,839
um any other state of affairs in the

169
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,159
world

170
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,740
merely describing it may not even help

171
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,260
us determine what's going to happen a

172
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,959
short time later let alone a long time

173
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,240
later or what might happen in a very

174
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,860
different ecology

175
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,860
whereas if we understand the processes

176
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,260
of sense making and decision making that

177
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,120
different kinds of cognitive agents do

178
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,600
certainly humans also though States as

179
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,640
cognitive entities which is what seeing

180
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,080
like a state or thinking like a state

181
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,760
entails

182
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,760
we get a process based View

183
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,100
on what otherwise might be merely

184
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,959
descriptive and along with that

185
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,380
process-based view we gain an increased

186
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,500
ability to make unique explanations

187
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,839
predictions accounts and so on

188
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,320
yeah we can we we can also understand we

189
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,440
can also

190
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,000
understand it

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,200
in a different perspective in terms of

192
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,899
realizing what

193
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,060
becomes sensitized and what becomes

194
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,040
desensitized

195
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,680
along the process so you can you can

196
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,040
possibly model that using this kind of

197
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,720
tools and understanding how that happens

198
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,959
over time right I don't know how

199
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,839
how much in terms of prediction

200
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,120
of things that were not foreseen in

201
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,920
these descriptions we can

202
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,980
we can achieve in fact

203
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,980
you can achieve some some level for sure

204
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,060
but

205
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,480
like that system should be decide how

206
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,740
how that delivers a very

207
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,240
all-encompassing prediction in this

208
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,440
country in these cases they don't

209
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,779
believe it can right I don't think

210
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,720
that's the purpose as well

211
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,820
but

212
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,860
we can

213
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,260
at least have

214
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,560
which is might not be as positive as

215
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,019
we won't but I think we can understand

216
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,120
how

217
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,640
okay we can gain some understanding in

218
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,920
this process of being more sensitive or

219
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,360
less sensitive to specific

220
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,120
primes and how this organization

221
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,700
organizational principles

222
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,399
uh how powerful they've become over time

223
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,800
yeah

224
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,600
I'll read some comments in the chat and

225
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,300
then Lorena or Brent feel free to just

226
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,640
give any thoughts just

227
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,240
upcycle Club wrote hello biomimicry can

228
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,540
enhance biosemiotics by showing us how

229
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,579
nature solves problems and creates

230
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,860
Beauty through signs and codes

231
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,260
and by encouraging us to apply these

232
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,939
principles to our own creations

233
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,800
yeah

234
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,860
the Jeff coding is an interesting idea

235
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,519
but to talk about codes I don't think

236
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,820
we CA that's my take right I don't

237
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,839
understand like you have we have encoded

238
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,279
uh any type of principles within our

239
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,060
uh cognitive ability but

240
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,120
uh biologically speaking

241
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,339
however you can understand these

242
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,980
encodings in terms of becoming more or

243
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,640
less sensitive over time to

244
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,680
environmental cues

245
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,339
as the example in terms of uh I use the

246
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,320
example of Forestry right

247
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,420
so in that specific case

248
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,360
this what becomes more

249
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,700
what you become more sensitive and the

250
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,220
more you organize your life or the

251
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,560
social life is organized around specific

252
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,120
principles

253
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,519
then you can make sense of these

254
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,660
relational stories

255
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,980
uh in instead of just leveraging unfold

256
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,360
um

257
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,079
difficult to explain notion of encoding

258
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,380
in terms of social cognition because it

259
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,839
will be hard to explain

260
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,000
how the brain will be encoding these

261
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,700
specific symbols but they can be cashed

262
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,820
out in the environment relationally in

263
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,480
terms of those organizational principles

264
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,500
and then you have this idea of

265
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,820
biomimicry like this

266
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,639
green iterations and how that comes

267
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,079
along in but

268
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,060
to explain what this mimic or this meme

269
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,560
will be then

270
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,620
a little bit not so so straightforward I

271
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,779
think

272
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,380
well certainly decompiling the source

273
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,880
code of nature

274
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,760
is somewhere between challenging and

275
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,579
misguided or impossible but that notion

276
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:42,540
of a code script for biology has

277
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,180
animated discussions of life going back

278
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,519
to for example Schrodinger's what is

279
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,620
life he basically says there's two

280
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,579
aspects of living systems there's their

281
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:55,980
organizational capacity their negotropic

282
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,220
capacity and then there's their code

283
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,880
script they're aperiodic crystalline

284
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,880
informational repository and then

285
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,880
another place that coding comes up a

286
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,139
little bit less in the source code space

287
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,240
is predictive coding

288
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,700
and that's in a way

289
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,040
highly compatible with active inference

290
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,220
and gives a deflationary account on how

291
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,740
the semiotics are encoded

292
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,540
rather than saying well this is what

293
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,519
this variable in the source code means

294
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,820
or this is what this code's for or

295
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,560
here's the code switch

296
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,200
predictive coding is like saying we're

297
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,139
not even going to touch the semantics of

298
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,959
what the sign is itself

299
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,260
we're just going to hypothesize that the

300
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,360
way that information about the sign is

301
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,300
transferred is through this maximum

302
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,860
information

303
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,899
signaling approach called predictive

304
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,720
coding because predictive coding arose

305
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,920
out of video compression algorithms and

306
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,160
only at the end of the 90s was found to

307
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,260
be increasingly relevant for neural

308
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,880
circuitry and so on

309
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,160
so it's another example of where like a

310
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,500
process based

311
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,199
approach

312
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,019
ends up deflating

313
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,019
or reframing

314
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,639
the

315
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,699
otherwise

316
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:29,399
semantically loaded question

317
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,320
it's like switching out the question of

318
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,120
like where we're going to be with how

319
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,920
we're going to get there

320
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,199
and instead of only focusing on the

321
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,360
meaning of the signs first off as if the

322
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,320
meaning of the science could be

323
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,779
discussed outside of their

324
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,339
implementation

325
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,019
and then even if we could figure out

326
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,779
what the signs were we would then just

327
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,100
turn around and want to know how they

328
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,540
were transmitted

329
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,000
and so predictive coding or predictive

330
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,139
processing

331
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,959
in a way short circuits that or inverse

332
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,380
it by first looking to explain how

333
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,320
information is transmitted that could

334
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,660
support

335
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,560
semiotics

336
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,660
and then in the context of biological

337
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,519
systems we naturally have biosemiotics

338
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,000
yeah

339
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,860
I would ask the question when you talk

340
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,600
about information being transmitted

341
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,820
right what that actually means and I

342
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,579
think that's a very very big topic and a

343
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,720
very large discussion in terms of

344
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,000
information information Theory when

345
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,060
specifically applying that into

346
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,660
um

347
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,899
biological systems I think there are

348
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,639
some interesting people working on

349
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,740
information that makes the case that

350
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,800
Shannon has a point and he's really

351
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,420
interested

352
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,000
not in the cement in the semantics or in

353
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,740
the meaning or anything else it's kind

354
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,180
of interested in the problem of

355
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,519
transmission and when you talk about

356
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,940
transmission

357
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,120
it was to ask what is being transmitted

358
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,599
exactly in the terms of of signals even

359
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,000
if you're capturing specific patterns

360
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,040
and you think that the partner is this

361
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,799
thing that will be transmitted in that

362
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,939
sense

363
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,500
but that would be a worse

364
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,980
um

365
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,740
I was asking questions

366
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,859
to understand like the

367
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,520
this notion of what is actually being

368
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,080
transmitted in that sense like is it

369
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,960
information this information theory is

370
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,360
focusing on this notion of the problem

371
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,059
of transmission and then all the the

372
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,860
concepts that come along to explain that

373
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,620
in terms of uncertainty or noise and

374
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,020
everything that

375
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,640
uh impact this transitional processes

376
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,600
and

377
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,460
if you're saying like we're transmitting

378
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,200
information in this sense that is

379
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,480
breaking this

380
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,880
semantic code apart yes it is because

381
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,580
like the problem is not focused on that

382
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,760
is that focusing on the specific

383
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,460
correlations that we have that we call

384
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,100
it they were mentioning as information

385
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,520
and how these correlations

386
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,059
are having issue from from the get-go

387
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,160
from what is being picked up in one side

388
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,179
being

389
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,460
correlated to what comes into the other

390
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,559
side right how that

391
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,900
how do you lose or gain more information

392
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,120
in that

393
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,679
but

394
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:35,720
the the

395
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,840
deeper question here is

396
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,240
uh how how can you say that you are

397
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,860
actually gaining or losing that

398
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,539
information because you are defining

399
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,799
this correlation that could be

400
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,780
transmitted or not

401
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,080
from the get-go if you don't have that

402
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,240
you don't have anything being actually

403
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,799
com actually communicated

404
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,440
so with that in mind you can

405
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,600
explain this Concepts in terms of

406
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,020
function and then there's a bunch of

407
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,500
theories that navigate this sense of

408
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,240
uh

409
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,820
signaling that is specifically only

410
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,700
functional and then predictive coding

411
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,539
tries to

412
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,360
trust to push that a little further

413
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,160
Maybe

414
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,080
but then you have to explain in

415
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,840
in a deep sense how this information is

416
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,640
being actually transmitted and processed

417
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,260
and I don't think that is really really

418
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,500
as obvious and as clear as we think it

419
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,679
is

420
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,500
specifically when you're talking about

421
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,720
this biological

422
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,679
way of nature navigating this process

423
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,320
this signaling

424
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,020
we have to talk about see because the

425
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,780
correlation if it's defined I've been

426
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,380
issue like from the beginning you then

427
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,840
only have this kind of transmission for

428
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,299
someone specific that can be able to

429
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,760
understand that in the other side right

430
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,400
well certainly whether we're talking

431
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,720
about

432
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,299
a chemical pheromone

433
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,840
that requires some type of receptor or

434
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,840
something more ephemeral like language

435
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,840
that requires more of a semantic

436
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,580
reference frame

437
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,340
there's no

438
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,500
receiving the message without the sender

439
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,660
it's like they're kind of the two sides

440
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,340
of the phone call

441
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,880
um I'll ask a question from the chat

442
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,980
love evolves

443
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,220
how about cultural encoding and

444
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,080
principles in contrast to organizational

445
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,399
so how do we think about

446
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,780
cultural meaning and is and is that

447
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,700
similar or different than organizational

448
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,980
yeah that's that's a good point right I

449
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,780
think if you take very seriously the

450
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,660
example from

451
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,900
the uh the forestry is a practice then

452
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,419
then I think it has to be organizational

453
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,539
in that sense the meaning navigate this

454
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:30,059
organizational

455
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:34,980
practice this organizational story that

456
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,799
that impacts

457
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,020
not only

458
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,380
communication between agents but also

459
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,419
how

460
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,720
how the environment will be interpreted

461
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,860
so and in this sense will be transmitted

462
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,500
and repeated over time because it has a

463
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,480
history and cannot ignore like the

464
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,419
history of this practices being pushed

465
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,059
further and replicated through

466
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,740
generations right

467
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,580
so

468
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,400
the way like the villages will be

469
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,320
organized in terms of that specific

470
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,539
practice for instance can be understood

471
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,900
in a meaningful and cultural way that

472
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,059
organizes life

473
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:28,399
in virtue of

474
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,080
some specific principles there

475
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,900
sensitizers uh agents towards

476
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,860
specific directions

477
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,520
and I think

478
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,260
how do I forget my point

479
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,780
uh for instance

480
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,179
you can talk about

481
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,080
uh

482
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,740
if you think about archaeological

483
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,919
findings and how

484
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,919
archaeological

485
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,039
descriptions of specific Villages and

486
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,500
how they navigate

487
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,520
this mapping out this this uh this

488
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,360
archaeological uh

489
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,760
sites they usually know exactly

490
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,400
if you have some kind of History already

491
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,059
from this this communities how this how

492
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,940
that City will be likely to be organized

493
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,539
first off like where is the water and if

494
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,039
the water is in certain directions

495
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,760
probably uh there will be certain kinds

496
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,039
of relationships with housing and

497
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,919
communal housings and where they're

498
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,700
gonna Place their dead in relation to

499
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,039
this kind of specific organizational

500
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,080
principle the water is here so

501
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,720
plantations will be not so far away from

502
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,520
that and

503
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,700
this city organizes like the village

504
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,200
organized a little bit in this sense and

505
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,460
that builds up

506
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,159
uh cultural practices

507
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,020
at least archaeologically can be

508
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,100
explained as such

509
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,280
I thought of something similar

510
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,580
um organization being the logistical or

511
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,360
the

512
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,480
operational

513
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,820
structural aspects so those would be the

514
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,179
roads that connect the forestry outposts

515
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:39,179
or the circulatory system that connects

516
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:42,120
the different organs of organization

517
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,559
and then the culture is a cause and a

518
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,419
consequence of organization

519
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:53,220
organization is the enabling conditions

520
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,440
for culture to arise okay so given this

521
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,360
road Network

522
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,960
what cultures arise how similar or

523
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,120
different are they convergently what are

524
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,940
their practices or their narratives that

525
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,260
are shared amongst these different

526
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,059
outposts

527
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,520
um or in in the bodily example okay

528
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,980
given the organization of the organs

529
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,280
literally the organizing process or

530
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,000
principle then what biosemiotics can

531
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,880
arise with glucose and insulin and

532
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,140
glucagon

533
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,620
and what culturally can arise

534
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,779
maybe even in terms of the generative

535
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,860
model of encultured Agents

536
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,960
as a function of organization and then

537
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,260
what are those encultured agents do

538
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,860
to the extent that they can modify

539
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,719
organization and so these kinds of

540
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,260
um

541
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,539
unrolling

542
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,240
cause and consequence relationships can

543
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,100
be hard to disentangle

544
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,460
because there's not like a clean single

545
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,740
starting point

546
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,279
that can be separated out

547
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,480
or because it unfolds historically

548
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,679
it's not exactly

549
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,279
a reaction in a test tube

550
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,520
so how does active inference give us an

551
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,380
entry points

552
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,159
into thinking about this

553
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,440
yeah I think oh that's something one

554
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,480
interesting thing about active imprints

555
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,159
that you you don't really need one uh

556
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,200
you don't really need an origin point

557
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,380
right you can start start modeling and

558
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,360
start understanding that at any any

559
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,360
given point and build up from from that

560
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,700
story and see how it unfolds

561
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,039
over time

562
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,279
I think that's the most beautiful idea

563
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,860
that you you define your parameters and

564
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,260
then you see from that parameters they

565
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,240
can be arbitrarily defined and you can

566
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,700
navigate

567
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,320
how things change within those

568
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,960
parameters in the generative model right

569
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,299
when you when you have your like

570
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,400
dynamical systems for instance you have

571
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,720
your state space they have some specific

572
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,480
range of

573
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,700
defining parameters that set

574
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,880
the limits of the possible states that

575
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,580
you're going to navigate and if you use

576
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,500
this notion

577
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,820
that these two densities brings about in

578
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,600
terms of position modeling you can use

579
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,779
these these kinds of tools to understand

580
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:43,159
how from that specific parameters

581
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:44,900
updates

582
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,659
what we narrate in active inference as

583
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,820
if belief updating

584
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:55,100
can change over time in these terms

585
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,279
that's a very nice point it reminds me

586
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,940
of Bruno latour's actor Network Theory

587
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,179
or ants which kind of Advocates a

588
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,620
similar approach to what you describe

589
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,539
which is like enter anywhere

590
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,520
open-mindedly

591
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,120
because in an iterated modeling or

592
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,620
iterated analysis setting the first

593
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,559
proposal or the first Trace detected

594
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,299
we know that's not the whole picture

595
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,640
there may not be a whole or only picture

596
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,039
so we need to answer and iterate and

597
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,380
then with active inference specifically

598
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,020
because of the compositionality that we

599
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,659
get within a layer Collective Behavior

600
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,360
and then also the kind of nesting

601
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,320
smaller things inside of bigger things

602
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,279
we can always build something

603
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,200
and then we can go oh wow it's like

604
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,880
there's a lot of top-down influence

605
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,600
maybe there's a a higher order factor or

606
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,059
slower factor or a contextual Factor we

607
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,200
should consider or oh we were

608
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,779
abstracting across these smaller things

609
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:07,860
inside but for a later day or if

610
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,799
relevant we can dive in

611
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,039
and so then

612
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,260
it allows a light holds or a grasp

613
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,000
on the proposed generative model

614
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,299
obviously it's map not territory but

615
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,760
even beyond that we always know that we

616
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,799
can expand laterally

617
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,200
and across scales

618
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,380
starting from anywhere

619
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,740
in an iterated

620
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,279
modeling process without our first or

621
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,000
even 11th model being proposed as like

622
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,720
the accounts of some complex cultural

623
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,720
phenomena which we're always gonna only

624
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,659
ever have our own perspectives on

625
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,240
yeah I think you don't really find that

626
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,539
in being so all in Corpus saying like

627
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,580
you have one model that will model them

628
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,120
all you can you you can navigate those

629
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,140
models in this More instrumental terms

630
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,179
it raises different questions when you

631
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:13,820
put things like that in terms of

632
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,059
genetology of models and uh models and

633
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,100
theories and Sciences but you they can

634
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,080
be also described as uh

635
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,399
tools for describe tools for adults for

636
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,799
for grasping in describing

637
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,779
phenomenon

638
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,260
in a more

639
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,440
non-committable way

640
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:42,899
how much that

641
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:46,799
how much that small girls in uh

642
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,600
philosophical or more ontological

643
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,120
problems it's still I think under like

644
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,620
debate

645
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,059
but

646
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,940
it is still

647
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,779
is still uh it is your children bring

648
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,159
insights

649
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,659
to think about

650
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,080
specific cultural

651
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,360
Collective uh phenomena which is not

652
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,600
it's it's complicated to

653
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,120
because I think what I'm getting at I'm

654
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,860
kind of like going back and forth but

655
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,779
when you talk about social sciences in

656
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,419
modeling usually you have like ways of

657
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:24,419
model modeling agents or ways of

658
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,640
modeling collectives and active

659
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,100
inferences trying to

660
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,919
to come up with a modeling in which you

661
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,559
can understand agency and collectives

662
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,539
within the same modeling uh schema

663
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,940
and I think the specific specifically

664
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,580
for these cases if you're interested in

665
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,039
understanding

666
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,559
types of cultural phenomena among

667
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,740
language users in

668
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,399
uh in a specific contexts you can at

669
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,980
least partially understand or have or

670
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,919
gain some insight in this agent

671
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,640
collected relationship that

672
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,080
that is a little bit more interesting

673
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,340
than

674
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,679
we have found so far in the social

675
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,740
sciences because you can have like or

676
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,260
specific understandings of memes but

677
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,720
then how the agent where is the agency

678
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,179
in that you you lose a little bit of

679
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:22,679
agency

680
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,539
well when you're trying to understand uh

681
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:30,600
only agents then you don't know how that

682
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,460
kind of scales up

683
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,460
because active inference tries and

684
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,200
offers this scale free

685
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,840
modeling tools that facilitates this

686
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,460
this

687
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,539
um

688
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:48,960
conversion into agents agents and

689
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,360
collectives

690
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,179
I would be interested in asking you

691
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:56,340
actually how

692
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,620
how do you navigate that when you talk

693
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,820
about social phenomena in ants or

694
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,600
termites or

695
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,080
because then yeah

696
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,720
you have very specific

697
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,200
coding demarcations I guess for for this

698
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,659
uh

699
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,860
social environments

700
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,720
yeah it's great

701
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,480
question it's also

702
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,000
whether it's a uh

703
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,960
open wounds or a a dirty closet that's

704
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,419
just shut there's actually a lot of

705
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:40,019
ambiguity and unresolved tension around

706
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,760
well

707
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,880
is the ant colony social are they social

708
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,320
insects that reifies the nest mate as

709
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,299
the individual and then what they're

710
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,880
doing is like when we hang out and talk

711
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,580
so reifying the nestomy as an individual

712
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,159
makes the colony social but if the

713
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,620
colony is individual

714
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,899
then what Nest mates are doing with each

715
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:06,539
other is not social any more than we

716
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,280
would describe the liver and the kidney

717
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,440
as having like a social single cellular

718
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,000
interaction but we know that would be

719
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,460
missing the point

720
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,280
and so there definitely is attention

721
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,379
with some of these evolutionary lineages

722
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,918
like ants being

723
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,739
monophyletically obligate usocial all

724
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,060
and only

725
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,359
ants are you social they all live in the

726
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,179
colonies there's no free living nestmate

727
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,099
whereas other

728
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,560
parts of the evolutionary tree

729
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,719
there are

730
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,179
life histories that do look a little bit

731
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,679
more like

732
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,560
social collaboration that can then

733
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,899
dissolve

734
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:53,480
and so knowing what level of lock-in

735
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,800
makes something

736
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,660
social

737
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,300
when are we socializing and what level

738
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,839
of lock-in goes beyond social and it

739
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,119
kind of like makes when the blanket is

740
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,300
so strong around the social

741
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,500
that

742
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,079
like for multicellularity

743
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,920
that it it's kind of losing the social

744
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,020
feature again

745
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,480
because if we just use social to mean

746
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,220
the connective tissue or the kind of

747
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,280
lubricant or the spaces between

748
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,960
everything

749
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,980
then it means nothing

750
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,180
so

751
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,460
a real tension is what space does the

752
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,540
Social account for

753
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:44,400
and is this going to be a

754
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,280
concept with a lot of creep

755
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,619
looking well it's a social relationship

756
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,560
between the roots of the tree and the

757
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,700
fungus

758
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,579
and it's a social relationship amongst

759
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,859
the molecules in the test tube is that

760
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:02,160
too broad of a social conception

761
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,940
are there downsides

762
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,460
or are there trade-offs associated with

763
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,220
the broader social concept

764
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,980
do we dilute what the social means and

765
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,480
then on the other side might we exclude

766
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,540
phenomena that could importantly be

767
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,180
considered social

768
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,619
well that's not social they're just

769
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,020
talking on a train it's like well that's

770
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,359
the other side if we were to have

771
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,060
carving out

772
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,280
encounters that we do want to include a

773
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,079
social and

774
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:40,500
is there a true social

775
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,859
does active inference help us sidestep

776
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:48,240
or at least negotiate this territory

777
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,480
because we could develop

778
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,280
a generative model or an ecosystem of

779
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,140
shared intelligence with one person and

780
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,839
two Internet of Things devices and a

781
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:02,400
bird

782
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,260
and a metronome

783
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,680
and just say we made what we made

784
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,079
and then leave it as a second order

785
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,240
interpretation

786
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,940
whether that is a social

787
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,780
setting

788
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,960
I mean I think you you are pointing out

789
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,680
like how other granularity of those

790
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,480
scales right if you have a model there

791
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,400
wouldn't you want to everything that you

792
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,140
already have it's probably not

793
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,480
interesting and not informative because

794
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,079
you cannot like Define those

795
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,520
limits of what you're trying to

796
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,440
understand

797
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,079
the other hand when you do that when you

798
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:45,119
define those limits if you're too narrow

799
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,619
or

800
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:48,540
you're gonna live out

801
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,119
you can idealize also in a way right and

802
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,579
leave out many other parts of of the

803
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,800
system that you're interested in

804
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,680
but if you don't do that

805
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,578
if you don't

806
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,680
if you don't make this this you should

807
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,720
make this decision when modeling you

808
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,060
think then how

809
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:14,640
how you can have any access to

810
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,560
to the phenomena right

811
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,260
and and to connect this to the forestry

812
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,200
so the forestry example

813
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,160
the

814
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,540
um desirata was Lumber now that may have

815
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,800
been a very

816
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,599
um narrowly scoped

817
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,720
desire but it's it's a relevant thing to

818
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,400
to want this resource and then

819
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,220
industrialization science as a process

820
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,940
um professionalization those allow the

821
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,000
description and and the handling and

822
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,579
ultimately the kind of top-down

823
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,680
um legibility and control thinking like

824
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,300
a forestry company

825
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,859
now with respect to the social sciences

826
00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:01,680
by analogy to forestry science so now

827
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,660
we're entering an era of increased

828
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:08,520
legibility and control of social systems

829
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,320
and

830
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,099
human natural capital and attention as a

831
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:17,640
resource trust as a resource

832
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,780
in a way is being cropped

833
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,240
analogous to produce the contents of

834
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,820
lumber but now there are social contents

835
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,700
so as the social

836
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,060
goes from being just only simply the

837
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,859
water we swim in

838
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:36,720
not something that's even compared

839
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,960
counterfactually to alternative

840
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,900
cultural possibilities per se

841
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,880
but Falls

842
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,839
under the scope of the professional

843
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:51,780
management like Forestry

844
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,180
then that's when this discussion of well

845
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,700
what's the lumber and what is the weeds

846
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,619
that are being pruned

847
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,980
and what ecosystem services

848
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,440
when we pay attention to certain parts

849
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,640
of

850
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,400
Human Social culture

851
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,800
and when we seek to

852
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,760
make more of this kind of lumber

853
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,420
what else does that come along with

854
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,980
and what decisions

855
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,140
come into play

856
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,200
and that comes along when you see the

857
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,500
process

858
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,599
or Instagram I don't know Twitter after

859
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,839
what happened to Twitter but

860
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:04,859
um

861
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,759
foreign

862
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,119
you do have that very effectively

863
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,220
already happening already

864
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,400
you can see how that happens if

865
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,800
efficiently in the world in elections

866
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,579
for instance it can be very very easily

867
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:29,520
manipulated and we saw what happened

868
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,099
in elections for instance in Brazil or

869
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:35,339
in the US and

870
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:38,540
well all over

871
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,480
uh

872
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,720
you navigate a system of uh attention

873
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,700
organization there

874
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,339
selects in only

875
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:54,320
what he thinks that you're interested in

876
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,440
in the effects of that in terms of

877
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,540
decision making and in terms of trust in

878
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,960
terms of

879
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:08,160
diversity of discourse we have seen that

880
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,760
it can be devastating

881
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,119
the question would be like how can you

882
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,400
make these a little bit how can you use

883
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,099
active inference and these tools that we

884
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:21,380
have

885
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,300
to make this kind of Technology a little

886
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,640
bit more inclusive without being super

887
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,099
awesome disruptive

888
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:32,780
is it even like

889
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:39,000
a possibility I I really don't know I

890
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,680
think it's an ethical problem that we

891
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,920
have when we talk about social systems

892
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,660
and these principles of attention

893
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,578
exclusion leaving things out

894
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:59,460
a lot to say on that

895
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,940
um with modeling and interpolating

896
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,000
and models whether it's large language

897
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,240
model type or linear regression type

898
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,740
it

899
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,500
is able to

900
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,640
interpolate to put data points Within

901
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,680
um an enclosure

902
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,460
of what has already been described and

903
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,319
Bayesian statistics and other types of

904
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:27,240
prediction algorithms are not immune to

905
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,540
that either if we have some prior

906
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,079
distribution belief

907
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,880
um we believe it's possible for it to be

908
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,420
between 20 and 30 degrees outside

909
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,119
then when we get data inside of our

910
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,980
bounds

911
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,160
we can converge and that actually

912
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,160
tightens our beliefs not always a bad

913
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,480
thing of course

914
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,880
and then outside of the scope of the

915
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,760
possible those data are just seen as

916
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,220
noise and they may not even be

917
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,980
integrated so then that can lead to

918
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,780
reinforcing process

919
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,260
not necessarily an Adaptive One either

920
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,780
where information that's confirmatory is

921
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,200
used to ratchet and increase precision

922
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,240
and then information that is not

923
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,859
confirmatory

924
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:21,319
is discarded as not useful

925
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,440
it doesn't yeah in this case it's yeah

926
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,220
it doesn't even enter the uh

927
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,319
the landscape right

928
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:34,140
of attention of the user in

929
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,799
a

930
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:43,740
what I what I'm what I was thinking in

931
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,819
relation to this new this idea of

932
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:52,500
a forestry is because we have

933
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,880
now organizational principles that are

934
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,480
faster and

935
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:06,359
more populated with uh information and

936
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,520
attention grabbing

937
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,359
kinds of prompts

938
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:17,759
we transformed the same uh

939
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:25,220
we choose from the same principle into

940
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,000
um

941
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,200
a harder to grasp

942
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,200
process it's it's hard it becomes more

943
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,800
complex it becomes harder to describe

944
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,140
this is the process of understanding

945
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,440
that in terms of Forestry is kind of way

946
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,200
more grounded when you apply that social

947
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,900
into this kind of environment

948
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,960
that we're talking uh like internet or

949
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,220
this highly

950
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,939
uh volatile

951
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,260
uh

952
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,680
and virtual in principle in environment

953
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,280
it becomes much harder to assess what is

954
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,560
being pruned out or not you just don't

955
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,599
know it makes it more clear that

956
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,859
there is a process of pruning you need

957
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,839
to have no control of what is being

958
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,160
taken out

959
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,420
you have no idea what's being like left

960
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:31,880
away from your perspective of attention

961
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,680
so to this

962
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,640
topic of intended or unintended semantic

963
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,980
pruning I think um

964
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,980
this has helped me identify attention if

965
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,859
we want to talk about the semantics or

966
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:49,020
semiotics biosematics whatever we want

967
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,980
to call it of the letter E in

968
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,260
relationship to letter A

969
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,599
we're looking for an account

970
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,099
that might convey letterness but were

971
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:05,700
generalized above Enis or anus

972
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,920
so in some ways we've erased or

973
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,680
abstracted generalized away from the

974
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,300
particulars

975
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,280
of the sign

976
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,980
its meaning

977
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:21,140
by taking a semiotic perspective

978
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,520
and so it's like

979
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,579
we got into the game to have a semantic

980
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:30,540
account of biological phenomena or of

981
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,440
any phenomena for biological entity

982
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,300
yet

983
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,480
this process

984
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,700
in a sense

985
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,300
distances us from the particulars that

986
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,079
actually do granted that meaning

987
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:52,560
in the actuality like if we walk into a

988
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,200
Sacred Space and it's like oh well that

989
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,660
is just doing that over there and this

990
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,520
architecture is doing this

991
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,619
and because of the layout people must

992
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,619
use the room this way

993
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,180
that's

994
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,579
removed

995
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:11,700
from the actual

996
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,859
meaning

997
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:16,500
which is the cause and consequence with

998
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,839
the organization and culture that we

999
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,819
discussed

1000
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:25,400
but that Prima fashion accounts

1001
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,960
doesn't generalize

1002
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,560
get any generalization that we make

1003
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,359
so that we can talk about multiple

1004
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,200
places or multiple letters on a common

1005
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,060
accounting framework is going to remove

1006
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,560
those particularities

1007
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:47,119
so it's a very challenging Catch-22

1008
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,339
whether we want to really

1009
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:53,520
accounts for the N equals one

1010
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,940
and maybe even live and act and play and

1011
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,579
work in the N equals one

1012
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:01,800
versus develop something that might be

1013
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,440
satisfying and cut and dry

1014
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,180
but it's always going to be on the

1015
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,640
sidelines with respect to what it

1016
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,720
actually means

1017
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,780
what do you mean like is I don't

1018
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,339
understand what you what you're getting

1019
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:19,220
at like is it you mean like it's

1020
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,440
generalized or not generalized it I

1021
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,660
didn't get that like when we have a

1022
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,359
general when we generalize

1023
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,180
when we

1024
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,520
ask what words mean

1025
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,339
what what words mean Beyond any given

1026
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,900
word we've lost touch with what any

1027
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,940
given word means

1028
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,380
um

1029
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,920
but words are what they actually mean

1030
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,560
in a situation

1031
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,859
so it's just in this scientific approach

1032
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:51,839
to meaning

1033
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,640
semiotics and semantics

1034
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,660
we have these two

1035
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,260
tensions or pay attention to reconcile

1036
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,780
between actually giving an account of

1037
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,940
the meaningfulness

1038
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,500
of the specific thing

1039
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,780
versus taking a more scientific approach

1040
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,060
which would be

1041
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,640
Gathering a group of similar things

1042
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,200
and finding their shared attributes

1043
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,599
which out of necessity must abstract

1044
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,460
must crop out

1045
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,260
features

1046
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,940
that

1047
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,880
are are

1048
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,500
empirically or

1049
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,560
um anecdotally taken to not matter like

1050
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,300
we abstract whether it was a Monday or

1051
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,640
Tuesday that we did the experiments

1052
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,619
we just combine all of our replicates

1053
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,180
together when we do the scientific

1054
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,839
analysis

1055
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,420
you you mean

1056
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,700
you mean if you generalize the practice

1057
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,559
you lose

1058
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,780
what you're being if you generalize it

1059
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,520
too much you lose everything that's

1060
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,980
meaningful joy in terms of like for you

1061
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,619
formalizing

1062
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:10,559
and then you have no yeah you you have

1063
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,540
an empty semantics you have a semantics

1064
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,760
there's no meaning that can only be

1065
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,859
meaningful in terms of how you apply

1066
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:19,500
that in terms of specific practices yeah

1067
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,359
it's like I I have a framework for you

1068
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,640
know the formal meaning of letters

1069
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,380
within words within sentences within

1070
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,540
paragraphs and then it's like well but

1071
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,000
now what's your next n equals one word

1072
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,500
that you're actually going to bring

1073
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,819
it's not just about building some

1074
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:38,339
abstract scaffold

1075
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:41,220
yeah for a bigger and bigger Boulders of

1076
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,480
meaning

1077
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,720
at some point through our embodied

1078
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,439
thought and action

1079
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,339
in our experience it is going to come

1080
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:53,400
down into the particulars

1081
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,800
and it doesn't immediately seem clear

1082
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,319
that simply generalizing further

1083
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,960
brings us there

1084
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,780
yeah yeah I particularly don't I I don't

1085
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,300
really believe you can have that

1086
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,460
kind of generalization I think we

1087
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,200
attempt to build whatever

1088
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,540
what I see that's the interesting aspect

1089
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,059
of the formal semantics you try to build

1090
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:24,380
this more General

1091
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,619
uh understanding that just formalizes to

1092
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:32,400
model but for that to be meaningful it

1093
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,920
has to be embedded in a way of

1094
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,700
practicing it like in a forestry

1095
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,319
practice you have to be embedded in a

1096
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,780
cultural environment in which that can

1097
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,720
be actually

1098
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,420
uh observed in terms of what happens

1099
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:52,619
when a generative model is being updated

1100
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:55,099
or not

1101
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:57,359
is that what you mean because otherwise

1102
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,300
I don't really understand how it becomes

1103
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,260
too

1104
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,079
yeah

1105
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,359
it becomes too formal it becomes too

1106
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:09,660
abstract in terms of some I would not

1107
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,618
understand what that is

1108
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,599
I'll think of a little more um Bran or

1109
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:21,240
TJ do you want to add any

1110
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,220
butter

1111
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,559
questions

1112
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:29,460
yeah sorry I I think like I don't have a

1113
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,079
lot of context I've been like following

1114
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:34,200
some of the discussion but not attended

1115
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,480
a lot of these calls I'm like it's all

1116
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,720
yeah yeah

1117
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,960
um yeah I don't know uh I think

1118
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,760
um

1119
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,440
yeah I'm in general just sort of

1120
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,079
interested in trying to understand the

1121
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,920
relationship between

1122
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,640
um yeah like

1123
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,319
sorts of like constructionist

1124
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:58,079
epistemologies and

1125
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,780
um yeah like generator models and active

1126
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,579
inference

1127
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:05,339
um style stuff and

1128
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:07,980
um how active inference style like yeah

1129
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,540
what are the philosophical commitments

1130
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,880
that active inference involves with

1131
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,380
respect to knowledge and epistemology

1132
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,780
and there's a sense in which like

1133
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,900
rational Choice models often

1134
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,260
assume a certain sort of like

1135
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,000
um objectivity to beliefs and then

1136
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,040
desires are where most of the degrees of

1137
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,260
freedom lie or something

1138
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,720
um whereas there's a lot of like issue

1139
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,160
like there's a lot of things that come

1140
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,579
up once you start talking about

1141
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:37,020
reflectivities or concepts themselves

1142
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,780
become self-fulfilling prophecies uh

1143
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,700
what you believe about what your beliefs

1144
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,040
about Society ends up shaping the

1145
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,900
society itself so there's the sense in

1146
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,599
which there's a codependence between the

1147
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,400
object of knowledge and knowledge about

1148
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,640
that object itself and I I think yeah

1149
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,339
like I'm sort of interested in like how

1150
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:57,960
the active entrance ways of thinking

1151
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,119
about this

1152
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,160
offers what perspectives on those

1153
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,680
questions and stuff like that

1154
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,098
um yeah

1155
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,099
thank you great questions

1156
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,359
yeah

1157
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:15,359
so when you talk about the uh object of

1158
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:18,839
knowledge and the knowledge itself and

1159
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,359
active inference

1160
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,078
uh

1161
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,460
I think you you you can think of

1162
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,619
in terms of this

1163
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,500
well there's a few ways to think about

1164
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,160
that I guess

1165
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,180
uh the knowledge itself it has to come

1166
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,300
epistemically from where your agent is

1167
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,880
actually embedded and situated

1168
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,980
specifically inactive influence it's

1169
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,819
embodied he kind of needs to have a

1170
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:01,140
model

1171
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,020
the model is modeling your body he's

1172
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,300
modeling a body that is in the world and

1173
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,619
it's all the time uh situated is never

1174
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:12,660
disconnected to its environment and it's

1175
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:16,680
his how the history of that environment

1176
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,520
right

1177
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,960
yeah

1178
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,420
uh

1179
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,339
but if you think if you push that to the

1180
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,680
object of that knowledge

1181
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,200
I don't know how how different

1182
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:32,280
um

1183
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,059
that will

1184
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,140
how different how can you different

1185
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:40,260
differentiate that so sharply when you

1186
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,079
talk about active inference

1187
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:45,619
because

1188
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,260
if you think of uh

1189
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,680
in terms of a generative model did what

1190
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,839
will be updated

1191
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:59,099
comes is updated from a prior that is

1192
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:02,280
always directed in this body in this

1193
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,440
situated

1194
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,359
uh Realm

1195
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:09,960
so they sort of conflate as I see maybe

1196
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,960
a maybe a mistaken but they sort of

1197
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,440
coverage in how you're gonna update your

1198
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,079
generative model which it will be at the

1199
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:22,500
same time in at the same time

1200
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,260
while you know and what you the object

1201
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:28,099
of this knowledge

1202
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:31,680
sorry if I can just like uh raise the

1203
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,200
question to that yeah so I think like I

1204
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,640
think that there is a sense in which

1205
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,359
like with respect to something that an

1206
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:40,500
epistemology would be called

1207
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,079
self-knowledge there is there is a

1208
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:44,579
question here that the the active

1209
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:47,520
inference agent has

1210
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,059
this model of that is like situated in

1211
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:54,359
the body or like in in its like

1212
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:58,260
um like structure and is also modeling

1213
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,420
that structure itself and there is like

1214
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:04,440
this issue of like where where

1215
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,059
yeah like the belief is not

1216
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:08,040
unidirectionally dependent on the object

1217
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,960
sort of a thing but has this feedback

1218
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,359
loop thing comes up there but there's

1219
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:15,599
another way in which I think like uh

1220
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,700
where this sort of thing comes where

1221
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,980
even if the object is outside of the

1222
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:20,819
body

1223
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:23,579
of the knowledge I think that that could

1224
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:27,180
still come up so for instance if I live

1225
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,579
in if if an active infants agent lives

1226
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,619
in a society

1227
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:33,900
of other active influences where

1228
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,700
currently all of them defect on

1229
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,260
prisoners dilemma

1230
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,380
but maybe like on further reflection

1231
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,720
they would want to like again like I

1232
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,920
don't know what further reflection would

1233
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,359
mean in the act of inference sense but

1234
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,880
I'm like just saying in the intuitive

1235
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,940
sense like that what would it mean for

1236
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,460
them to like go from one fixed point to

1237
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,900
another fixed point where they're all

1238
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,720
cooperating or or or something like that

1239
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:01,859
and that that I think is not key to me

1240
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:04,200
like how that shift can happen in active

1241
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,400
inference where

1242
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,119
it's not just purely using the empirical

1243
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,099
information to keep

1244
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:15,180
running the the middle of the of your

1245
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,500
like

1246
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,660
free energy equation but also

1247
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,640
recognizing the contingencies

1248
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,040
and then identifying those contingencies

1249
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,200
to make something like

1250
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,799
gifts from one state to another like if

1251
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:34,500
if I model that the society is a cruel

1252
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,359
space and if everyone models the society

1253
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:38,640
is a group space then we will end up

1254
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,680
creating a society that is a cruel space

1255
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,619
but if only we could recognize that our

1256
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:45,720
belief or our model that societies are

1257
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,660
cool space is a contingent belief and we

1258
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,680
could all somehow negotiate or

1259
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,440
communicate and shift to a different

1260
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,020
belief about what Society is and Society

1261
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,880
is a kind place then we will end up

1262
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,339
creating that kind of society or

1263
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:04,440
something and

1264
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,040
that sort of like a belief about the

1265
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,720
thing that Society is

1266
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,720
not entirely within the agent like it's

1267
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,839
sort of it it it has a weird

1268
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,579
intersubjective character so it's not

1269
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:20,099
entirely outside of the agent either but

1270
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:22,680
it's not entirely in like internal to

1271
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,940
the agent either or something

1272
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,940
you can think of that like you're

1273
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,500
talking about active influence action

1274
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,680
comes first right you have to you you

1275
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,020
don't have the knowledge like

1276
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,720
inside your head waiting for you to to

1277
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,240
push that out of the action has to come

1278
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,359
first so if you

1279
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,760
if you take that as a principle an

1280
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,760
organizing principle it depends on the

1281
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,799
contingency of your actions the

1282
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,720
possibilities might be limited by your

1283
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,339
situated

1284
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:57,299
um

1285
01:00:57,299 --> 01:00:59,220
condition for

1286
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,319
they are limited it doesn't mean that

1287
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:02,700
you don't have like

1288
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,339
a range of options from that state space

1289
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:08,460
in which you can go you can navigate so

1290
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,280
you can navigate it for the good or for

1291
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,460
the bad but it starts with the the

1292
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:17,400
action perception Loop starts with the

1293
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,700
action

1294
01:01:20,099 --> 01:01:22,500
I'll add a few other pieces on that

1295
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,740
DJ very good point like

1296
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:29,460
when we see the pragmatic component of

1297
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:32,819
action as self-fulfilling

1298
01:01:32,819 --> 01:01:35,339
epistemic component of action having to

1299
01:01:35,339 --> 01:01:36,839
do with gaining knowledge and the

1300
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:38,099
salience of information but the

1301
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:39,780
pragmatic component is about bringing

1302
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,299
our observations into alignment with our

1303
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:45,540
preferences and then you identified two

1304
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,880
related settings one of them is like

1305
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:52,440
pure intra subjectivity like I expect

1306
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,619
myself or I find myself or I habitually

1307
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:57,299
think about X

1308
01:01:57,299 --> 01:01:59,299
well that's kind of a trivial

1309
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,619
self-fulfillment because thinking about

1310
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:05,040
something is its own fulfillments

1311
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,799
and then when we're in this second

1312
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:11,160
person or social space

1313
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,220
we can agree on little performance or or

1314
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:15,540
on a game

1315
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:19,200
and games give evidence to that that

1316
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,420
when people are able to perform

1317
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,359
communication or message passing such

1318
01:02:24,359 --> 01:02:28,440
that new expectations or preferences are

1319
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,640
set

1320
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,119
whether more top-down like more seeing

1321
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,579
like a state or more laterally more like

1322
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:38,579
Collective Behavior then those regimes

1323
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:40,260
can be embodied

1324
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,700
and then you brought up a very important

1325
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,280
point about the awareness of the

1326
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,440
contingencies or where awarenesses of

1327
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,140
adjacent possibles or of counterfactuals

1328
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:54,000
so the body might be um we could model

1329
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,700
its morphology as doing some computation

1330
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,740
but that doesn't mean that the the

1331
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,839
morphology has an awareness or can

1332
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:03,000
explore a counterfactual

1333
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,940
like bodies are not always exploring

1334
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:09,119
every counterfactual

1335
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,220
um because skin is in the game but again

1336
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:15,240
mentally it's very cheap and easy to

1337
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,299
consider counterfactuals and situational

1338
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:21,480
awareness of social settings especially

1339
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,280
if it can be not understood but

1340
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,980
communicated

1341
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,720
opens up a space where we're all playing

1342
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,660
prisoner's dilemma now there's

1343
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,500
parameterizations of prisoners

1344
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,260
multi-agent prisoners dilemma where

1345
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:37,140
tragically we just all defect all day

1346
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,000
and never learn

1347
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,220
there's also parameterizations where you

1348
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,619
just start all cooperating and never

1349
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:44,760
defect

1350
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,859
and then the interesting settings are

1351
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:48,200
where there might be like phase

1352
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,440
transitions or where a perturbation

1353
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,960
moves the system from one attractor into

1354
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,359
another attractor

1355
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:01,559
there's just a lot of richness and

1356
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:03,599
that's the work of building generative

1357
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,880
models and that iterated modeling

1358
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,680
process

1359
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,000
to to

1360
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,880
unpack and refine

1361
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,260
and

1362
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,420
active inference isn't going to have a

1363
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,520
stance on a prisoner's dilemma

1364
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,040
we can use active inference to describe

1365
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,780
the prisoners dilemma but active

1366
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:24,059
inference isn't going to come down on on

1367
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:26,040
literally even a little two by two Game

1368
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,420
Theory Matrix

1369
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,000
so we can then extrapolate that active

1370
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,859
inference is not going to come down with

1371
01:04:31,859 --> 01:04:33,240
an opinion

1372
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,980
on something significantly

1373
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:41,760
more rich and real than a 2x2 Game

1374
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,380
Theory Matrix

1375
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,319
and so that work

1376
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,359
is what

1377
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:50,640
people enact

1378
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,440
in applying active inference

1379
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,119
right and I think like my question is

1380
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:03,299
something like that insofar is like

1381
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:07,559
humans try to constantly improve the

1382
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:10,260
social games

1383
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:13,380
how can we model that sort of a prior

1384
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,900
over your actions or policies

1385
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,240
that enables that sort of like

1386
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,920
Progressive

1387
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,599
um

1388
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:25,260
um improvements or something

1389
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,859
well

1390
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,720
you can we are assuming that we're

1391
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,880
trying to improve right we we don't know

1392
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,339
that but we can model them as improving

1393
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:36,960
but

1394
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,559
like following Daniel's lead you we're

1395
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,960
talking about this specific games and

1396
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,480
contingencies they they this this

1397
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,299
transitions from one state to another

1398
01:05:48,299 --> 01:05:49,920
specifically if you're talking about

1399
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,140
this modeling of social

1400
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,260
actors and talking about several actors

1401
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,059
in your model involves several of them

1402
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:59,400
will not be really linear right you

1403
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,140
don't have like an easy

1404
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:04,500
smooth transition of improvement you can

1405
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,359
capture

1406
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:09,480
over time as modeling

1407
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,079
how they might tend to go towards a

1408
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:15,240
direction and understand that as

1409
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:19,740
Improvement but that takes

1410
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:22,500
specific iterations that will not be

1411
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,240
fully linear I guess

1412
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,059
specifically if you want to understand

1413
01:06:26,059 --> 01:06:30,299
error and Improvement instead of trial

1414
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:33,480
and error but fire and adding up into

1415
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,819
this error like

1416
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:37,859
error Improvement

1417
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:39,839
but when you're modeling specifically

1418
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,900
with dynamical systems for instance you

1419
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,880
you're not going to see a full linear

1420
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,220
story and I don't think you're gonna see

1421
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,299
that

1422
01:06:48,299 --> 01:06:51,480
uh if you're modeling using active

1423
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:56,059
inference in multiple agents agents

1424
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:59,280
I'll add one piece there so how can we

1425
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,240
go about modeling multi-scale social

1426
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,740
goals

1427
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,720
so

1428
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,460
we could think about

1429
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:11,520
different citizens in a region

1430
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,319
and

1431
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:16,799
they the modeler is going to choose what

1432
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,579
knowledge to realize in the generative

1433
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:21,480
model

1434
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,099
like

1435
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:24,900
what you put into the calculator it's

1436
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,539
going to calculate upon now this happens

1437
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:30,359
to be a elaborate

1438
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:32,220
stochastic

1439
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:37,079
method but if we only tell people yeah

1440
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:39,240
there's just your personal income

1441
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,460
optimize for that your preference is to

1442
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,559
have that be higher well then the

1443
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,940
simulation is going to unfold a certain

1444
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,880
way if we say well there's your personal

1445
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,420
financial income and then there's your

1446
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,640
city and then there's your region

1447
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,400
then that opens up

1448
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,400
through through different

1449
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,920
mechanisms you know maybe an individual

1450
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,240
goes flat or neutral on the personal in

1451
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,599
service of a larger win at a higher

1452
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,200
level

1453
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,000
well now what if the modeler says it's

1454
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,799
not just about the financial income now

1455
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:15,299
we're also going to have this secondary

1456
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:16,500
Criterion

1457
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:19,500
well now different agents could attend

1458
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,920
differently to those two different

1459
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,660
outcome variables

1460
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:27,540
and maybe there's one simulation where

1461
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,460
50 only care about this and fifty

1462
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,080
percent care about that and it works

1463
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,460
perfect or doesn't work

1464
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:39,420
it's like a broad surveying you know or

1465
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:41,479
Lego set or or

1466
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:46,020
grammar or or active inference ontology

1467
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,140
for

1468
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:51,420
scoping very broadly and very

1469
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,339
inclusively

1470
01:08:53,339 --> 01:08:58,920
but all the work is in the real

1471
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,040
simulation developments

1472
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,040
and sweeping

1473
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,880
because very little could be said about

1474
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,100
a game theory game if you didn't know

1475
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:14,100
what the parameters were in The Matrix

1476
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,540
you wouldn't know whether this

1477
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:17,339
prisoner's dilemma

1478
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:18,719
was going to be like an always

1479
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,698
cooperator which agents with which

1480
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,198
strategies would or wouldn't cooperate

1481
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:24,359
if you don't know what the Matrix looks

1482
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:25,380
like

1483
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:27,179
so before

1484
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:31,198
the values have kind of been filled in

1485
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:34,500
it's just like actually describing the

1486
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,299
adjacencies and the counterfactuals and

1487
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:37,979
the contingencies of our scientific

1488
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:40,399
model

1489
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:43,799
but that's still prior to having the

1490
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:45,660
model in hand

1491
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:47,520
and the model you know so now we're

1492
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,920
looking at that tree in the European

1493
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,120
Forest

1494
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,040
it's like well if I had this tool then I

1495
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,360
could cut it down this way if I had this

1496
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,980
tool I could cut it down this way or I

1497
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,080
could wait it's like

1498
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,420
that's

1499
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:04,380
alternative actions about that tree

1500
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,020
now in the social science setting

1501
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:08,640
discussion of different scientific

1502
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,640
methodologies are like counterfactuals

1503
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,380
about that

1504
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,280
social tree

1505
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,620
yeah and specifically if you're

1506
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:31,400
navigating this kind of game theoretical

1507
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,320
models if that's what you're interested

1508
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:38,360
in you can even Define in terms of

1509
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:42,120
prisoner's dilemma for instance uh

1510
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,060
specific values to see

1511
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:50,580
what happens when everybody def uh

1512
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:54,659
deflects and in how frequent modulate

1513
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:57,860
those frequencies in terms of specific

1514
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:02,100
uh in multiple iterations how

1515
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:07,980
how are you gonna build up the wage or

1516
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:11,640
the tendency of deflecting again if your

1517
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,580
neighbor deflected once and deflected

1518
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:17,360
twice or three times or

1519
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,960
and see how that will accommodate

1520
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,260
over time how many times this agent will

1521
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,600
change its behavior until it stops

1522
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,820
changing the behavior

1523
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,440
but that you don't really

1524
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,980
that's that that again you use you might

1525
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:40,380
use a by Asian understanding a version

1526
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,900
model for that but not necessarily

1527
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,780
explained

1528
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,100
uh

1529
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,159
um

1530
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,980
it does not necessarily explain the

1531
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:53,820
action

1532
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:56,460
fully I mean

1533
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,400
social work you just you're modeling

1534
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:03,620
only the interest of that specific actor

1535
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:08,699
I I have a slightly meta question if I

1536
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,699
can ask both of you uh I'm not sure how

1537
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:15,060
these calls usually go uh I'm curious

1538
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,520
what are your interests in active

1539
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,320
inference what do you think like what

1540
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,179
brings you to active inference and like

1541
01:12:21,179 --> 01:12:22,380
what do you think

1542
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,960
what do you think active inference adds

1543
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,880
to our theoretical understanding and in

1544
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,659
what ways or something

1545
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,199
the right Nick go for it

1546
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:36,560
well

1547
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,820
I think I was trying to touch upon that

1548
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:42,000
before and how we can

1549
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,340
if you're navigating for instance

1550
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,860
behavior in terms of Game Theory this

1551
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,540
kind of modeling if you're talking about

1552
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:51,000
like trust games for instance you're

1553
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,580
gonna understand how this

1554
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,980
to addict interactions evolve over time

1555
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:58,199
specifically over interactions

1556
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:01,739
but you don't have an account

1557
01:13:01,739 --> 01:13:03,960
of change because I have very limited

1558
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,580
options of actions

1559
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:08,159
and

1560
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,920
you don't have an account also on scales

1561
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,900
and I think active influence tries to

1562
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:15,060
Edge a little bit and account of how you

1563
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:19,679
can scale that and how uh

1564
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,679
uh

1565
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,260
how can add more parameters into the

1566
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:29,460
game and see how they evolve with a more

1567
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:30,540
clear

1568
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:31,980
uh

1569
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:34,260
understandings of a richer understanding

1570
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,760
that for instance when you talk about

1571
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,560
specific interactions in Game Theory

1572
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,080
so when that's one

1573
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,900
one aspect that active influence kind of

1574
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:50,400
contributes another point is because we

1575
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,760
have this

1576
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,940
parameterization that is specifically in

1577
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:59,219
terms of belief updating and also in

1578
01:13:59,219 --> 01:14:02,000
terms of Dynamics

1579
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,040
we are always talking about

1580
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,960
agents that will be situated and

1581
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:12,620
embodied and have a very specific uh

1582
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,800
synchronization with the environment all

1583
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,840
the time because when you talk about

1584
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,179
active inference the action comes always

1585
01:14:21,179 --> 01:14:24,659
first so you have a less you try to have

1586
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:27,920
a less reductive model

1587
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,020
especially anywhere you want to model uh

1588
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:34,020
cultural agents and Collective action I

1589
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,880
think that's kind of desirable that's

1590
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,640
what you're looking for

1591
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,159
is it also your area of Interest

1592
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:45,679
sorry is it also your area of Interest

1593
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,980
mine or is that Lorena's area of

1594
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,099
Interest

1595
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:53,699
what do you mean

1596
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:55,679
oh sorry like my question was also like

1597
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,420
what brings you to

1598
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,920
active and friends and I think you

1599
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,659
answered a lot of ways in which active

1600
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:03,780
inference adds theoretical value but I

1601
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,239
wasn't sure like if that was also your

1602
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,640
subjective interest or motivation as

1603
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,340
well subjective interest yeah and I'm

1604
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,320
curious to see how that pans out right I

1605
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,400
I'm interested in how that helps us to

1606
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:22,620
to think of this type of uh

1607
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:24,179
phenomena

1608
01:15:24,179 --> 01:15:27,480
and I'm very interested in how this

1609
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,760
relationship for agents to collectives

1610
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,000
and Back Again work like

1611
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
um

1612
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:39,420
I think it might give us some

1613
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:42,780
well you give us some very insightful

1614
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:47,659
way of modeling these relationships

1615
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,480
and navigating it as you want because

1616
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,960
this this uh feature of being scale free

1617
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,179
is kind of helpful in

1618
01:15:57,179 --> 01:15:59,340
to looking things you can you can Define

1619
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:00,780
your

1620
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:03,659
uh Markov blanket in terms of are you

1621
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:08,780
interested right and see what happens

1622
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,699
I don't know yeah I'll just give a few

1623
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:16,920
thoughts even though also surely some of

1624
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:20,280
these thoughts are are scattered

1625
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,560
um you're asked DJ what is active

1626
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,020
inference add to our theoretical

1627
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:27,840
accounts of the social

1628
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,960
it does many things in in my view and

1629
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,739
that's what makes it so valuable

1630
01:16:33,739 --> 01:16:37,080
epistemically and pragmatically it gives

1631
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:40,380
us the expressivity

1632
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,659
within a scale to describe Collective

1633
01:16:42,659 --> 01:16:44,760
behavior and across scales to describe

1634
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,780
nested systems so that brings continuity

1635
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:51,659
to discussions of the social with

1636
01:16:51,659 --> 01:16:54,020
broader discussions of the biological

1637
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:58,080
ecological computational physical and so

1638
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,480
on so that's a multi-scale

1639
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,520
transdisciplinary element

1640
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,560
active inference provides us with

1641
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,320
legible first principles

1642
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,620
which can either be taken instrumentally

1643
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:14,120
as just heuristics

1644
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,159
and also in certain situations can be

1645
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:19,260
viewed empirically

1646
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:20,840
as

1647
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:24,000
justifiable first principles and then

1648
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,100
from those legible first principles

1649
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,620
which are not English specific

1650
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:32,120
they're already in a space

1651
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:36,620
that has a lot more

1652
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,320
possibility and promise

1653
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,679
than for example a mere enumeration of

1654
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:46,739
important adjectives or nouns

1655
01:17:46,739 --> 01:17:49,080
we can develop lists of important

1656
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,000
adjectives and nouns

1657
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,580
when we have a broader cognitive

1658
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,620
modeling framework

1659
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:59,760
and so this methodological turn

1660
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,219
then supports just a tremendous

1661
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,580
diversity of thought and work

1662
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,980
instead of asking us to kind of go

1663
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,540
through the eye of the needle and you

1664
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:12,300
know get on board with this one

1665
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,060
ranking of features and then try to

1666
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:17,400
apply it more broadly that's like an

1667
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,000
overfit before the cart situation with

1668
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,360
active we can expand the methodological

1669
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,860
discussion

1670
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:28,080
connected to theoretical physics and

1671
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,699
Mathematics in ways that really haven't

1672
01:18:29,699 --> 01:18:31,260
been seen before

1673
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:33,960
and then that opens up more than it

1674
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,159
closes down

1675
01:18:35,159 --> 01:18:39,060
it brings up more questions than it

1676
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:42,179
resolves in and of itself but it opens

1677
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:44,940
the questions that can be resolved

1678
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:47,940
like what generative model can I make

1679
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:50,820
that will keep the temperature in this

1680
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,739
building livable

1681
01:18:52,739 --> 01:18:54,600
but active inference isn't going to have

1682
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,400
a stance on what you should do for that

1683
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,560
building

1684
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,440
so we need to in a way take a step

1685
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,800
in the methodological Direction

1686
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,780
which I see as moving towards active

1687
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:09,840
inference to enable

1688
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,300
a million steps in different directions

1689
01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:17,400
hmm

1690
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,640
I have a bunch of questions here uh

1691
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,000
I think one is probably just a reference

1692
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,880
question uh the three topics that I'll

1693
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,860
say if you guys have any papers or

1694
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:31,320
articles on those things I would love to

1695
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:35,760
like get a reference one is

1696
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,280
in what ways can we model a collection

1697
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,380
or an aggregation of active influences

1698
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:41,960
as a

1699
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:46,199
like super agent or like super like

1700
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:47,760
active infant super agent or something

1701
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,980
and like how how does this like

1702
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,260
decomposition and aggregation

1703
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:55,020
uh like flexibility work in different

1704
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:57,360
contexts like if there's like

1705
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,960
work that tries to either make

1706
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,179
informal commentary or formal modeling

1707
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:05,880
either ways I would love to see that

1708
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,520
secondly you just click on the first

1709
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,260
just on the first

1710
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:12,900
check out the previous section of this

1711
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,140
course on Collective Behavior where I

1712
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:19,080
reviewed many such works great thanks

1713
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,140
okay is it on the same notion

1714
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:23,940
is it linked from the same notion thing

1715
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:26,820
all in the same places and in the same

1716
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,860
playlist with this core same syllabus

1717
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:31,679
yes good okay

1718
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:34,020
um the second is is that an active

1719
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:37,320
entrance account of

1720
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,739
same markets or economic interaction

1721
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:44,159
wherein like your your prices act as

1722
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,199
some sorts of like information signals

1723
01:20:46,199 --> 01:20:48,780
and like like can can use active

1724
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,880
inference to then talk about aggregation

1725
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,020
in

1726
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:54,659
of Market entities or something I'm

1727
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:56,699
guessing this would also be covered in

1728
01:20:56,699 --> 01:20:59,159
the same list indeed people have

1729
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:02,040
explored cognitive economics and people

1730
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,320
are working on it but that doesn't mean

1731
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,480
it's a done deal theoretically or

1732
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:10,260
especially in practice so keep going I

1733
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,780
think it's quite experimental still but

1734
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:13,980
there are a bunch of people working on

1735
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,480
that I guess

1736
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,760
I I don't remember any specific paper

1737
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,760
right now but I can I can look it up and

1738
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,040
uh

1739
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,620
forward to you but yeah yeah it would be

1740
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,780
great uh I can drop my email address

1741
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:30,000
here yeah sure

1742
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,580
uh the third is probably more trickier

1743
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:35,159
than both of these which is is there an

1744
01:21:35,159 --> 01:21:36,780
active inference account of natural

1745
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,000
language

1746
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,860
um

1747
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:43,679
yes thankfully colleagues like Elliot

1748
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,020
Murphy and others

1749
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:49,020
have explored specifically the

1750
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:51,960
linguistic aspects of

1751
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:56,040
natural speech I think Lorena's

1752
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,120
lecture and area focus

1753
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,300
generalizes a bit beyond specific

1754
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:05,520
natural language because we're talking

1755
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,120
about semiotics and semantics in a more

1756
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,000
Intermodal sense however yes there's

1757
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
been limited work from a computational

1758
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,520
Linguistics and neurobiology perspective

1759
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,420
on speech

1760
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:24,239
okay so then

1761
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:27,199
uh

1762
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,719
okay so you said something like false

1763
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,239
principles stuff when you're making a

1764
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:34,440
commentary on what act of Interest

1765
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,640
brings

1766
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,820
I have still I have I'm still often like

1767
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,320
struggling what is active inference

1768
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,480
offering and I like try to encounter

1769
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,360
different things I think I enjoy a lot

1770
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,100
of philosophical questions that oh the

1771
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,260
the conversation opens up but like I'm

1772
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:50,880
still like really ambivalent about the

1773
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,260
theory

1774
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:55,500
um and when I read like this new book uh

1775
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,440
which Tristan has not written uh but

1776
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,480
like is and go author I don't remember

1777
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,940
was the name of the book

1778
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:05,120
um

1779
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:07,260
um I don't yeah I don't exactly remember

1780
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,060
there's a book right which is like

1781
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:11,699
supposedly like supposed to be the Canon

1782
01:23:11,699 --> 01:23:14,159
and like Tristan as a co-author but in

1783
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,199
the preface he says

1784
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:21,000
so that's the 2022 par friston pezula

1785
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,040
textbook

1786
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,380
yeah yeah

1787
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:26,520
I wouldn't quite say it's the Canon

1788
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,760
since it's a short book but certainly it

1789
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,480
is a landmark moment for the fields

1790
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,540
right and when I read that

1791
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:41,100
the one thing that bothered me was

1792
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:43,560
it brings up the helmets uh free energy

1793
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,420
thing

1794
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:48,840
but it sort of argues it by Fiat like

1795
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,540
okay this is a simple principle it can

1796
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:54,120
Model A lot of things but that doesn't

1797
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:57,840
tell me why I should why I should trust

1798
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,020
it like what what is the reason to act

1799
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:03,719
why that why does this principle lead to

1800
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:07,140
cognition like what like sure your

1801
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:09,300
positive a very simple principle and

1802
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,340
then said hey look this simple principle

1803
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,679
can explain so many things but well it

1804
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,080
can it also explains things that don't

1805
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,780
look like cognition and like like I'm

1806
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:22,440
not sure like there's an I got an

1807
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,800
account of why that principle is like

1808
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,940
uh works or something

1809
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:31,860
the right nickel for it I'll think of

1810
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:34,260
some other ways to say it yeah you you

1811
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:36,719
can think of like modeling by

1812
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:38,760
construction and modeling by first

1813
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:41,580
principles and if modeling by first

1814
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,620
principles you have

1815
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:46,500
you have some limitations in which you

1816
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,620
cannot fully explain some things

1817
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,179
but

1818
01:24:51,179 --> 01:24:53,880
the virtue of the model and how the

1819
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,739
first principle organizes everything

1820
01:24:55,739 --> 01:24:58,140
that comes along with the model usually

1821
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:01,560
might be sufficient or might be a useful

1822
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,679
a useful tool to help you explain that

1823
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:07,020
phenomena that based on the first

1824
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,380
principle that you were bringing along

1825
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:13,260
and that's one way of one part of

1826
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:14,880
answering this question is I think it

1827
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,640
might be a big question for the

1828
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,460
for the field

1829
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:24,060
yeah here's some short little threads on

1830
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:25,320
that

1831
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,159
yeah we can describe

1832
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:31,080
maladaptive cognitive systems or

1833
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,520
adoptive cognitive systems whether

1834
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,800
something's adaptive or not is always in

1835
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,260
relationship to its Niche like the

1836
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:38,820
foraging algorithm that works in the

1837
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:40,800
desert doesn't necessarily work in the

1838
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,800
rainforest so these systems are not like

1839
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:47,640
intrinsically adaptive or not we want to

1840
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,080
have natural language that allows

1841
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:53,219
sentences that are valid and invalid and

1842
01:25:53,219 --> 01:25:54,840
have different kinds of semantics so

1843
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,280
again this is just an expressivity

1844
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,600
framework

1845
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,900
that enables people to build cognitive

1846
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:03,780
models of high reliability or important

1847
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,300
settings or you could make something

1848
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,820
that looks just like a beautiful circuit

1849
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:11,580
board and not even worry about what the

1850
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:13,679
outcome is so so yeah for sure you can

1851
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:16,260
describe all kinds of systems that would

1852
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:17,699
be like

1853
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:21,179
um having a uh less than functional

1854
01:26:21,179 --> 01:26:22,980
methodological system if we said well

1855
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:24,239
we're doing a linear regression

1856
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:25,679
framework but we only want positive

1857
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:27,840
regressions it's like well not the

1858
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,280
methodological level we wanted to be

1859
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,920
able to do any slope so here in the

1860
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,560
cognitive modeling setting we want more

1861
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,420
expressivity so that we can actually

1862
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:37,980
construct the ones that we're interested

1863
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:41,400
in and then how does this

1864
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,460
really do cognition

1865
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:47,580
how is it that a first principles like

1866
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:50,760
surprise minimization or the bounding of

1867
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,920
surprise through free energy how can

1868
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,900
that really cover

1869
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:58,980
so many cognitive phenomena

1870
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:02,159
that's the question and the play but how

1871
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:05,340
is it that Newton's Laws of Motion can

1872
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:07,620
describe so many objects

1873
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:10,860
being dropped off a tower

1874
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:14,219
how is it that Bayesian mechanics can

1875
01:27:14,219 --> 01:27:17,400
describe so many different priors being

1876
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,139
updated

1877
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:22,380
and so by understanding cognitive paths

1878
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:25,320
as Paths of least action which is the

1879
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,540
free energy principle

1880
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:31,699
a wide variety of models

1881
01:27:31,739 --> 01:27:34,580
become

1882
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:38,280
of us of a similar account

1883
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,060
now become available yeah

1884
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:44,100
whether that's useful to a given person

1885
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,199
in a given setting like if you make an

1886
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:47,580
active inference model of your business

1887
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,020
it doesn't mean you're going to succeed

1888
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:50,940
if you make a self-driving car with

1889
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,199
active inference it doesn't mean it's

1890
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:53,639
gonna work

1891
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:57,420
this isn't a guarantee of success

1892
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:00,360
but it's a method that can be utilized

1893
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,940
and we know that the method reaches

1894
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:06,179
different kinds of modeling outcomes

1895
01:28:06,179 --> 01:28:08,159
and supports

1896
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:10,260
subsequent perspectives and models from

1897
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,420
where it reaches

1898
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,060
but we can't a priori limit where the

1899
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:17,219
method reaches to like only the

1900
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:19,800
successful ones or only biological

1901
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,060
systems

1902
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:22,560
then we wouldn't even have the

1903
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,300
expressivity to talk about cognitive

1904
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:28,580
ecosystems with synthetic intelligences

1905
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:30,960
um and when you're talking about

1906
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,960
cognition also we can use this kind of

1907
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,699
first principles

1908
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:37,860
two model aspects of cognition but you

1909
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:39,840
might not necessarily think that

1910
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,880
cognition is all encompassing like that

1911
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,940
everywhere all the same but you can use

1912
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:46,860
that to model specific things that

1913
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:49,139
you're interested in in cognitive

1914
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:52,260
behavior like adaptivity does it give me

1915
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:53,940
any insight to understand what is

1916
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:56,940
adaptive adaptive behavior for instance

1917
01:28:56,940 --> 01:29:00,239
in which kind of insights do I get are

1918
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:02,159
they interesting are they useful so

1919
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:05,699
that's what they're availability that

1920
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:08,100
this kind of model brings along so you

1921
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:10,500
can you don't have to believe in in the

1922
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,480
whole story but it gives you a lot of

1923
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:16,199
Leverage to ask ask questions and what

1924
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:19,759
kind of questions you'll be asking

1925
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:25,199
okay so let's say that like like Acro

1926
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:26,880
inference and free energy allows me to

1927
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,679
talk about systems

1928
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:31,199
uh but

1929
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:35,040
does it give also give me vocabulary

1930
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,679
to then classify those systems

1931
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:39,900
in terms of let's say adaptivity would

1932
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:40,920
be one

1933
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,840
property but like there could be other

1934
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,360
properties in terms of like

1935
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,639
how much

1936
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:50,699
how rich the world model is or stuff

1937
01:29:50,699 --> 01:29:53,159
like that or yeah

1938
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:56,040
um if you have a portfolio of generative

1939
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,420
models

1940
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,820
you could summarize them according to

1941
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:02,520
the TJ statistic you could summarize

1942
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,139
them according to the number of nodes

1943
01:30:04,139 --> 01:30:06,300
you could put them into a common

1944
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,159
environment or different environments

1945
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,320
and summarize their activity in any

1946
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,940
number of ways

1947
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,340
but we can't

1948
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:17,219
talk about a ranking or a summarization

1949
01:30:17,219 --> 01:30:19,260
of a portfolio of generative models

1950
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,699
that's not in hand

1951
01:30:20,699 --> 01:30:22,620
this is a framework that lets us build

1952
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:25,080
those diverse generative models

1953
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,360
and then in a very open-ended way do

1954
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,239
model comparison model selection model

1955
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:31,679
adequacy

1956
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,080
all the kinds of complex systems

1957
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,760
engineering

1958
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,560
methods

1959
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:41,000
that we want

1960
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,139
and also I would

1961
01:30:43,139 --> 01:30:48,000
ask you where do you see appear

1962
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,719
or a comparison first principle

1963
01:30:51,719 --> 01:30:53,580
you know active inference has legible

1964
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,100
first principles which are reflected in

1965
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:57,840
the active inference ontology and

1966
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,760
expressions using it which can be

1967
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,320
represented in natural language so

1968
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,719
that's the talking about it but it's not

1969
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:06,719
only represented in natural language

1970
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:08,520
other Frameworks have other first

1971
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,020
principles that may or may not be

1972
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:11,219
legible

1973
01:31:11,219 --> 01:31:12,480
and

1974
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,360
people may choose difference yeah to go

1975
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:19,159
down for whichever number of reasons

1976
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:24,540
you can compare them and see which one

1977
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:26,880
gives you the best inside that you're

1978
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,260
looking for

1979
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:30,780
well so yeah I think like

1980
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:34,320
something that I could compare to active

1981
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,060
inference is like say the Bayesian

1982
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:38,280
utility maximization thing

1983
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:41,639
and which has a different ontology I'm

1984
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:44,280
not a fan of that either like that also

1985
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:47,880
I'll just Bayesian utility maximization

1986
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:51,420
is a special case of free energy where

1987
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:53,699
there's no epistemic value

1988
01:31:53,699 --> 01:31:56,520
all you have is pragmatic value and so a

1989
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:59,219
special diminished

1990
01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:01,260
not necessarily you have value of

1991
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:03,239
information and you have explore exploit

1992
01:32:03,239 --> 01:32:05,520
trade-offs in Bayesian utility

1993
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,780
maximization as well like you like like

1994
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:11,639
if you load into your utility function

1995
01:32:11,639 --> 01:32:14,639
if you can beg the question and load

1996
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,580
epistem into pragma you're right then

1997
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:19,920
all you need is pragma but in expected

1998
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,139
free energy we have epistemic and

1999
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:25,080
pragmatic value which is what enables us

2000
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,480
this expressivity but I think we're

2001
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:30,138
aligned on that

2002
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,300
right I I think like I'm somewhat like

2003
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:35,400
also slightly confused because in the

2004
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,320
Bayesian utility like between the

2005
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,000
languages comparing the languages as

2006
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,800
such like in the Bayesian utility

2007
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,420
maximization

2008
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:45,380
the exploration parts that are

2009
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:47,940
prioritized based on

2010
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:50,659
your X and the

2011
01:32:50,659 --> 01:32:53,760
estimation on the value of information

2012
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,620
uh whereas

2013
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:59,340
I'm not sure that holds true for the

2014
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,679
active inference model as well that the

2015
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:05,820
episode The epistemic exploration is

2016
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:09,320
prioritized or valued in terms of some

2017
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:14,780
of the same uh pragmatic thing as well

2018
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:19,199
you'll yeah you'll have a a a lot to

2019
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,980
explore and learn you can make a model

2020
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:25,560
that is 80 20 or 2080 or 100 zero

2021
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,900
between epistemic and pragmatic there's

2022
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:30,060
nothing we can say across generative

2023
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,040
models about whether active inference

2024
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:35,400
prioritizes episteme or not because you

2025
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,199
can make a model that's a hundred

2026
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:39,600
percent or zero

2027
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,080
sorry I I meant more like does active

2028
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,540
inference allow us to talk about systems

2029
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:47,159
or the Bayesian utility maximization

2030
01:33:47,159 --> 01:33:49,560
doesn't allow us to talk about but yeah

2031
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:50,880
I'm talking particularly about

2032
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,699
expressive power of the language yeah um

2033
01:33:53,699 --> 01:33:56,639
like is it like are there things that

2034
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:58,199
the Bayesian utility maximization can

2035
01:33:58,199 --> 01:33:59,699
talk about that active infants cannot

2036
01:33:59,699 --> 01:34:02,719
other things that active influences

2037
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:05,880
two short answers one short answer

2038
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:10,679
utility maximization must cram epistemic

2039
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:13,040
value into pragmatic value

2040
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,780
we gain more expressivity when we can

2041
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:18,000
articulate out pragmatic value which is

2042
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,380
the alignment of preferences with

2043
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,780
observations from epistemic value which

2044
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:23,940
is Information Gain so that's a huge

2045
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,739
articulation and the second thing is

2046
01:34:25,739 --> 01:34:28,739
when you're in a anything maximization

2047
01:34:28,739 --> 01:34:31,020
framework when you're in a utility

2048
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:32,940
function now again begging the question

2049
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:34,500
how you constructed this function that

2050
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,540
you're trying to maximize when you're in

2051
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:39,060
a maximization framework we have a

2052
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:42,300
well-known set of approaches for finding

2053
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:45,420
local and Global Maxima using

2054
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:48,540
optimization or maximization Frameworks

2055
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:51,780
what octave inference uniquely provides

2056
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:54,239
is it describes the path that that

2057
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:56,400
cognitive thing takes

2058
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:01,020
as a path of least action that minimizes

2059
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:02,219
surprise

2060
01:35:02,219 --> 01:35:04,139
so instead of climbing to the top of the

2061
01:35:04,139 --> 01:35:06,179
hill up are we on a Foothill or are we

2062
01:35:06,179 --> 01:35:07,320
on the biggest hill

2063
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,480
we're like a ball rolling to the bottom

2064
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:12,060
of the hill finding the least surprising

2065
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:14,760
path now that least surprising path can

2066
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,739
still include novelty and Information

2067
01:35:16,739 --> 01:35:18,480
Gain

2068
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,460
but it turns out to be a lot more

2069
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:22,860
tractable and connected with statistical

2070
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:25,139
physics and quantum mechanics when we

2071
01:35:25,139 --> 01:35:27,360
talk about the path of least action ball

2072
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:30,239
rolling down the hill rather than this

2073
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,219
sort of question bag on top of a

2074
01:35:32,219 --> 01:35:34,380
mountain climbing adventure Bayesian

2075
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:37,340
utility approach

2076
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,920
but it's up to each person to feel how

2077
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,120
they want to feel

2078
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:43,760
yeah

2079
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,080
it's a little a little bit what's in the

2080
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,880
book as well when you take the low and

2081
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:50,340
the high road for free energy principle

2082
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:51,780
right

2083
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:56,820
because how much you want to have your

2084
01:35:56,820 --> 01:36:01,280
utility maximization function being

2085
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,440
disconnected to the department to the to

2086
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,919
the action

2087
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:09,480
because when you Model Behavior it will

2088
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:12,000
be hard to do that independently like

2089
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,040
you have a lot of you have way more

2090
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,020
assumptions you are committing to much

2091
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:19,380
to a greater level of assumptions for

2092
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:21,960
your utility function we if you don't do

2093
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:24,139
that

2094
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,659
because it's the pragma with with the

2095
01:36:27,659 --> 01:36:31,380
action first that pragmatizes you you

2096
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:34,080
you have reasons to describe reasons to

2097
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,179
believe why that information gain works

2098
01:36:36,179 --> 01:36:38,280
the way that it does

2099
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:41,219
you can leverage some explanations on

2100
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:44,340
that without it you you have you have

2101
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:45,900
you you have a model that has more

2102
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:48,239
assumptions and I think if you have a

2103
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,880
model with less assumptions it's always

2104
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,800
healthier let's say so

2105
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:58,020
yeah so I think like that that that does

2106
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:00,420
talk about the compare compare the

2107
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:03,120
analysis of the expressivity but I I

2108
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,800
would also say as a matter point that

2109
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,620
like I'm not happy with either of those

2110
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:11,400
languages but I'm like I am suspect that

2111
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,380
both of those languages claim certain

2112
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:14,760
ontological

2113
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,500
assumptions and I'm like always

2114
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:18,420
suspicious but like where are these

2115
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:21,420
ontological assumptions coming from

2116
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:25,139
a few other points we tap into

2117
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:27,139
an absolutely

2118
01:37:27,139 --> 01:37:31,139
meaningful Nexus of statistical methods

2119
01:37:31,139 --> 01:37:33,360
and message passing schemes

2120
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,219
with active inference if you can State

2121
01:37:35,219 --> 01:37:36,600
something in the active inference

2122
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,820
ontology and construct a generative

2123
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:41,639
model then

2124
01:37:41,639 --> 01:37:43,620
message passing algorithms can be

2125
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,840
deployed that contractibly compute that

2126
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,300
model so that's absolutely non-trivial

2127
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:50,580
otherwise it's possible just to get

2128
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:53,219
wrapped up in some analytical formalism

2129
01:37:53,219 --> 01:37:55,860
but then once you want to do that on a

2130
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:57,900
4K video

2131
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,520
now you're on Square zero with the

2132
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,260
computer engineering this is not that

2133
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:02,280
way

2134
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:05,040
and then I will respond to your meta

2135
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:07,320
point with a metapoint which is

2136
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:10,080
when we've enumerated the alternatives

2137
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,900
the one that we like best personally I

2138
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:15,300
feel happy with I'm also open to New

2139
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:17,600
Alternatives arising but being

2140
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,000
unhappy when all things considered is in

2141
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,440
play

2142
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:24,239
why

2143
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:28,260
what bothers you specifically on the

2144
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:31,159
ontology of

2145
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:35,400
the active influence

2146
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:38,659
yeah like I I think like I'm still

2147
01:38:38,659 --> 01:38:41,880
looking for

2148
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,679
I I don't know what exactly I'm looking

2149
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,659
for but I feel dissatisfied with the

2150
01:38:45,659 --> 01:38:47,639
account given for why hell models free

2151
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:48,659
energy

2152
01:38:48,659 --> 01:38:52,580
least action thing like

2153
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:56,100
is the central thing here or something

2154
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,080
like why does it work like why does this

2155
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:00,559
principle

2156
01:39:03,659 --> 01:39:05,460
there's a lot of funny answers I could

2157
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:09,480
give there yeah that that Delta that

2158
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:12,239
discrepancy

2159
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,820
that's curiosity and that's the space of

2160
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:16,860
the open and that's learning and that's

2161
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:19,440
your unique contribution to make

2162
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:23,219
and that's everything so that's not just

2163
01:39:23,219 --> 01:39:27,360
a thorn in your shoe that's like

2164
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,699
our experience of action amidst

2165
01:39:29,699 --> 01:39:31,679
uncertainty

2166
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,560
which is the water we're in

2167
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,340
and so whether we take a higher order

2168
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:40,320
narrative perspective on that

2169
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:43,560
discrepancy being dissatisfying or that

2170
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:46,320
discrepancy being satisfying I think

2171
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,880
it's pretty nice I just need to minimize

2172
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,440
my surprise there

2173
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,239
yeah and you can choose to minimize your

2174
01:39:51,239 --> 01:39:53,460
surprise through your attention

2175
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:56,100
you can choose to minimize surprise at a

2176
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:59,040
higher narrative order like I'm

2177
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:01,920
satisfied and complacent that I don't

2178
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,900
understand number Theory but I use

2179
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:06,659
numbers to count objects around me

2180
01:40:06,659 --> 01:40:08,400
so that discrepancy and understanding

2181
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,080
knowing that there's a thousand years of

2182
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,380
research that could be done on numbers

2183
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:16,320
it doesn't unsettle me but for someone

2184
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,020
else that might be unsettling and that

2185
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:20,760
might lead them to ruminate it also

2186
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,260
might lead them to do a PhD in number

2187
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:24,780
Theory so just different paths for

2188
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:28,199
difference individuals and contexts

2189
01:40:28,199 --> 01:40:30,360
but there's always so many Technical and

2190
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:33,920
meta levels with active huh

2191
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,260
okay so I don't want to like keep you

2192
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:41,460
guys over time uh but I would ask one

2193
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:44,000
last reference based thing which is

2194
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,980
other active and Friends accounts of

2195
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:48,900
seeing like a state phenomena

2196
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:52,320
uh in any literature I think I heard you

2197
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,120
mentioned it once so I was like yeah

2198
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,639
like this

2199
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:00,840
yeah check out live stream 33 series but

2200
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:04,199
also this course that were literally

2201
01:41:04,199 --> 01:41:06,840
actually enacting in

2202
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,940
with avell

2203
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:11,400
is where these

2204
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:15,060
accounts come to roost and where we're

2205
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:17,400
creating a space to develop it and it's

2206
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:19,440
not a cathedral for us just to spectate

2207
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,380
at today but if you want to make an

2208
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:24,300
active inference generative model

2209
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:27,120
of whatever social setting when you have

2210
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,679
the model in hand

2211
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:32,460
a lot of your questions will be

2212
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:35,420
sidestepped

2213
01:41:35,639 --> 01:41:38,520
okay where is the 33 thing that you

2214
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:41,460
mentioned if you go to the page with all

2215
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:45,179
of our Instagram live streams and look

2216
01:41:45,179 --> 01:41:47,280
in the live stream series like the paper

2217
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,540
discussions

2218
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:51,600
in the 33 series there's a DOT zero

2219
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,760
video with background and context and

2220
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,199
then we have a DOT one and a DOT two

2221
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:57,900
conversation with authors but avell

2222
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:00,000
who's also the course coordinator for

2223
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,360
this course and Kairos research like

2224
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:06,260
evils and and colleagues work has

2225
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:10,199
heavily built on the seeing like a state

2226
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:13,679
thinking like a stay optimal grasp all

2227
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:16,940
these different topics

2228
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:20,760
yeah I'm yeah I'm on your YouTube

2229
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:23,040
channel I'm slightly finding it hard to

2230
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,679
find the thing

2231
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:28,260
um if you look up live stream zero three

2232
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:31,440
three point zero or if you go to in the

2233
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:33,420
video description of any video where it

2234
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:36,239
says all live streams here go there and

2235
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:37,679
search for but you'll you'll find it and

2236
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:40,139
you can always email us we're going to

2237
01:42:40,139 --> 01:42:42,119
get in contact but yeah

2238
01:42:42,119 --> 01:42:44,159
and I think our valves paper are like

2239
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:46,380
thinking like a state also can help you

2240
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:48,480
a lot to understand how

2241
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:52,139
how uh active inference modeling is

2242
01:42:52,139 --> 01:42:53,820
useful for the social sciences in

2243
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:56,580
comparison to other types of modeling he

2244
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:58,320
makes a comprehensive description

2245
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:01,320
interesting

2246
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:04,679
great thanks uh yeah and this is this is

2247
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:09,000
our first iteration on this course we

2248
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,280
are going to continue

2249
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,900
bringing new information to the table

2250
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:15,360
and supporting individuals who want to

2251
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:18,420
build generative models you know around

2252
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:20,340
this area

2253
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:21,719
whether it's part of the internship

2254
01:43:21,719 --> 01:43:24,000
program or part of a course credit or

2255
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,560
different kinds of programs that we'll

2256
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:28,320
be able to develop

2257
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,639
but

2258
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:32,880
this is the real thing and we're able to

2259
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,219
work with people who want to think and

2260
01:43:35,219 --> 01:43:37,020
do

2261
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:39,600
make sense

2262
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:43,260
indeed any closing thoughts on TJ then I

2263
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:46,760
will go and then Lorena with last word

2264
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:49,139
um no this was great thanks thanks to

2265
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:51,300
the conversation

2266
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:53,520
thank you all thank you for Brandon TJ

2267
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,980
for joining Lorena for the

2268
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:59,400
lecture this was a fun discussion we

2269
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,360
never really

2270
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:03,540
know where how it's gonna go but

2271
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:06,540
I'm glad that we could cover so many of

2272
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:07,560
these

2273
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:09,480
topics and

2274
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:12,119
probably raise more questions and

2275
01:44:12,119 --> 01:44:13,560
footholds

2276
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:17,400
van door slams so thank you again Lorena

2277
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:21,300
yeah thank you for inviting me and I

2278
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:23,219
think active influence

2279
01:44:23,219 --> 01:44:25,020
like holds a lot of space for

2280
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:27,780
experimenting as well as some things you

2281
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:29,460
try to see if they make sense and

2282
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:31,980
they're gonna hold up and open new

2283
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:34,440
questions and that might be an

2284
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,619
interesting aspect of

2285
01:44:36,619 --> 01:44:41,059
uh of the framework itself

2286
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:43,380
thank you everybody thank you everybody

2287
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:45,960
for the great live chat comments there's

2288
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:48,840
a lot there I couldn't read it all so

2289
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:50,520
until next time

2290
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:53,420
but

2291
01:44:54,119 --> 01:44:57,019
foreign
