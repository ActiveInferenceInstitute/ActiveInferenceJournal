00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,562
Hello and welcome. It is September 12,

3
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:14,226
2023. We're here in the Active Inference

4
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:16,518
for the Social Sciences course at the

5
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:19,462
Active Inference Institute and having a

6
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:22,438
discussion section on semiotics and

7
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:26,098
semantics here with Lorena Sganzerla.

8
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:28,046
We're going to be having a fun

9
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:30,190
discussion, I hope. If you're watching

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,542
Live, please feel free to write any

11
00:00:32,596 --> 00:00:35,966
questions in the Live chat. If you

12
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:37,146
thought about joining and you weren't

13
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:39,402
sure, it's not too late. Otherwise,

14
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,554
we're going to pick up on some key

15
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:44,862
points from the lecture and on the topic

16
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:47,746
and see where we go. So,

17
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:51,220
Lorena, welcome back

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,870
and however you want to begin,

19
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,246
let's go from there. Okay.

20
00:00:58,428 --> 00:01:00,710
Hello. Thank you, Daniel.

21
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,122
So let's try to recap a little bit where

22
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:09,482
we left off during

23
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:13,354
the lecture just

24
00:01:13,392 --> 00:01:16,650
to remind us where we were. Like, my

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,510
point, what I was trying to articulate

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,574
was the idea of what does

27
00:01:24,612 --> 00:01:27,194
it mean to talk about a formal semantics

28
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:31,614
in a way that is not really loaded

29
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:34,866
because it's an interesting thought.

30
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:39,054
Like to have a semantics

31
00:01:39,102 --> 00:01:41,714
that is actually only formal, right? In

32
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:45,414
principle, it would be relative to

33
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:48,934
meaningful to

34
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:52,440
meaning, right? In the notion that

35
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,622
active inference is trying

36
00:01:57,676 --> 00:02:00,040
to cash it out.

37
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,222
It's more like an idea or a way of

38
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:10,942
modeling how we deal

39
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:13,630
with meaningful situations.

40
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,238
And to understand that in a

41
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:21,074
more interesting, more embodied and more

42
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:24,514
concrete way. I was suggesting that

43
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:33,860
we could use biosemiotics as a

44
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,120
as a model and as a theory for

45
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,560
living creatures like language users to

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,570
navigate the realm of symbols.

47
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,994
And gave one example which

48
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:55,414
came from James

49
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:58,890
Cott, which is the European

50
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,310
forestry that comes with a practice

51
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,770
understanding this scientific

52
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,430
understanding of forests as a practice

53
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,234
that allows us to

54
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:15,042
refer to meaningful things

55
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:18,034
in the environment in terms of what is

56
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,034
valuable, what's interesting and what is

57
00:03:20,072 --> 00:03:27,218
not and interestingly,

58
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:29,414
what is more important also from what

59
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:34,120
becomes valuable. It is what is

60
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,194
cropped out from the meaningful

61
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:41,510
perspective. So things natural

62
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,834
parts of nature becomes left out or

63
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:47,354
understood as something that is not

64
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:52,174
desirable. And you just understand what

65
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:56,122
you don't want in your articulating

66
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:58,174
principle as wheats or something that

67
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:02,466
you should get rid of in

68
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:05,026
respect to what is more desirable in

69
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:08,434
terms of crops and how you understand

70
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:13,242
nature in a more commoditized

71
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:13,960
way.

72
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,122
And I find, like this example from Scott

73
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:31,146
kind of very elucidating in

74
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:34,266
the book. He creates this in the book,

75
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:35,994
he's talking about states how we

76
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:39,886
articulate life around one specific

77
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,086
notion of state. But in this specific

78
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:46,634
example, he has the idea of one official

79
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:49,386
observer. And this official observer

80
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:53,010
establishes a principle of meaning

81
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,374
in a way, you have to have a handle

82
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,460
of nature, and that also articulates how

83
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,082
villages and how practices

84
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:10,262
around agriculture and

85
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:12,262
how people relate to each other within

86
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:14,390
these practices gets organized

87
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,616
specifically for one interesting

88
00:05:21,798 --> 00:05:25,104
point that he makes that is to

89
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:29,200
appreciate the constriction of that is

90
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,324
like a vision that notices not what

91
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:34,932
within the meaningful crops, but which

92
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:38,340
is left outside the field of vision.

93
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,324
And I bring that specifically to

94
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:47,956
understand how the

95
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:52,008
fragility principle can or could

96
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:54,512
be connected to a generalized

97
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:58,444
synchronization over time in

98
00:05:58,482 --> 00:05:59,916
relation to those symbols and those

99
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:02,460
practices in terms of niche construction

100
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,896
and how

101
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:11,744
this niche construction brings along

102
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:17,516
with the symbolic use of language,

103
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,010
predictive value.

104
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,782
Thank you. Brynn, want to bring up any

105
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:33,062
thoughts on that or any other pieces or

106
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:34,710
I'm happy to add a comment.

107
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,790
Brynn okay,

108
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,030
guess not. Okay.

109
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,888
A lot to say there. There was a little

110
00:06:59,894 --> 00:07:01,632
bit of a double play with what is

111
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:05,024
cropped. On one hand, what is cropped is

112
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:09,430
the industrial crop that is being

113
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,300
prepared.

114
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,476
And then the other side of that coin is

115
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:18,992
what is cropped out. And what we crop

116
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:20,804
in is the part that we're paying

117
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:23,140
attention to and we can't pay attention

118
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,408
to everything. So it's like two sides of

119
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:29,256
the same coin. What we pay attention to,

120
00:07:29,438 --> 00:07:32,184
what we include in attention in our

121
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:35,320
cognitive awareness, leaves the shadow,

122
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,420
which is what we exclude.

123
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,196
And that could be like the weeds or

124
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:44,108
the other ecosystem services. So by

125
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:46,624
highlighting the meaning or one

126
00:07:46,662 --> 00:07:48,864
dimension of meaning or one stance on

127
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:52,016
meaning, it's like

128
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,264
a seesaw that becomes salient to the

129
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:58,564
extent that something else must be

130
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:01,076
deprioritized. So that's how we

131
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:03,556
accentuate these distributions of

132
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:06,896
meaning. And what do we get from active

133
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:09,328
inference and free energy principle

134
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:12,184
beyond, for example, what's provided in

135
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:15,208
seeing like a state? I think there's a

136
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:17,784
lot we could say on that. But one piece

137
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:22,090
is we get a process theory, a real

138
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,092
procedural approach to how different

139
00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:29,324
systems come to do sense

140
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:32,012
making and cognition and action. So just

141
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:35,616
describing the lay of the land or the

142
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:40,832
history of forestry in Europe or any

143
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,330
other state of affairs in the world,

144
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,624
merely describing it may not even help

145
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:49,076
us determine what's going to happen a

146
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:51,892
short time later, let alone a long time

147
00:08:51,946 --> 00:08:54,132
later, or what might happen in a very

148
00:08:54,186 --> 00:08:56,724
different ecology. Whereas if we

149
00:08:56,762 --> 00:08:59,444
understand the processes of sense making

150
00:08:59,482 --> 00:09:01,588
and decision making that different kinds

151
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:04,756
of cognitive agents do, certainly humans

152
00:09:04,948 --> 00:09:06,964
also though states as cognitive

153
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,728
entities, which is what seeing like a

154
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:11,636
state or thinking like a state entails,

155
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:15,212
we get a process based view on

156
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:17,064
what otherwise might be merely

157
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:19,308
descriptive. And along with that process

158
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:22,712
based view, we gain an increased ability

159
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:25,684
to make unique explanations,

160
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,210
predictions, accounts, and so on.

161
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,330
Yeah,

162
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,516
we can also understand

163
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:41,124
it in a different perspective in

164
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:45,616
terms of realizing what becomes

165
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:49,060
sensitized and what becomes desensitized

166
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,332
along the process. So you can possibly

167
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:56,424
model that using these kind of tools and

168
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,072
understanding how that happens over

169
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:01,640
time. I don't know how much

170
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,744
in terms of prediction of things that

171
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:07,000
were not foreseen in these descriptions,

172
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,410
we can achieve. In fact,

173
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,912
you can achieve some level for sure,

174
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:17,920
but that system should be decide

175
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,872
how that delivers a very all

176
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:24,992
encompassing prediction. In this case,

177
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:27,468
I don't believe it can. Right. I don't

178
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:29,590
think that's the purpose as well,

179
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,204
but we can at

180
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:39,012
least have which might not be as

181
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:42,584
positive as we want, but I think we can

182
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:45,816
understand how we

183
00:10:45,838 --> 00:10:47,576
can gain some understanding in this

184
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:49,944
process of being more sensitive or less

185
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:55,032
sensitive to specific primes

186
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:59,180
and how these organizational principles,

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,590
how powerful they become over time.

188
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,128
Yeah, I'll read some comments in the

189
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:11,724
chat and then Lorena or Brent feel free

190
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:15,304
to just give any thoughts. Just upcycle

191
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:18,760
club wrote hello. Biomimicry can enhance

192
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,852
biosemiotics by showing us how nature

193
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,916
solves problems and creates beauty

194
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:26,464
through signs and codes and by

195
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:28,684
encouraging us to apply these principles

196
00:11:28,732 --> 00:11:30,320
to our own creations.

197
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,492
Yeah, the idea of

198
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:39,044
coding is an interesting idea, but to

199
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:43,456
talk about codes, I don't think that's

200
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:46,724
my take. Right, I don't understand. We

201
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:50,964
haven't coded any type of principles

202
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:54,372
within our cognitive

203
00:11:54,436 --> 00:11:58,472
ability. But biologically

204
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:01,756
speaking, however, you can understand

205
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:04,536
these encodings in terms of becoming

206
00:12:04,568 --> 00:12:07,548
more or less sensitive over time to

207
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:11,776
environmental cues as the example

208
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:14,656
in terms of I use the example of

209
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:18,610
forestry. Right. So in that specific

210
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,890
case,

211
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,516
what? You become more sensitive and the

212
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,540
more you organize your life, or social

213
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,428
life is organized around specific

214
00:12:31,514 --> 00:12:35,064
principles. Then you can make sense of

215
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:40,008
these relational stories instead

216
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:45,960
of just leveraging one full difficult

217
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,436
to explain notion of encoding in

218
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,156
terms of social cognition because it

219
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:55,688
will be hard to explain how the brain

220
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:58,136
will be encoding these specific symbols,

221
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:00,384
but they can be cashed out in the

222
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:03,056
environment relationally in terms of

223
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:06,864
those organizational principles. And

224
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:10,364
then you have this idea of biomimicry

225
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:13,988
like this reiterations and how that

226
00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:18,484
comes along to

227
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:21,024
explain what this mimic or this meme

228
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:25,108
will be then not so straightforward,

229
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:30,212
I think. Well, certainly decompiling

230
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,732
the source code of nature is somewhere

231
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:36,504
between challenging and misguided or

232
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:39,340
impossible. But that notion of a code

233
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,032
script for biology has animated

234
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:45,916
discussions of life, going back to, for

235
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:47,916
example, Schrodinger's. What is life?

236
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:50,384
He basically says there's two aspects of

237
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:52,576
living systems. There's their

238
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:55,056
organizational capacity, their

239
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:58,124
negantropic capacity, and then there's

240
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:01,864
their code script, their Apyotic

241
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:05,136
crystalline informational repository.

242
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:07,572
And then another place that coding comes

243
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:11,744
up a little bit less in the source

244
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:15,028
code space is predictive coding.

245
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:18,756
And that's in a way highly compatible

246
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:21,096
with active inference and gives a

247
00:14:21,118 --> 00:14:23,384
deflationary account on how the

248
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:26,424
semiotics are encoded. Rather than

249
00:14:26,462 --> 00:14:28,084
saying, well, this is what this variable

250
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:30,136
in the source code means, or this is

251
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:33,404
what this codes for, or here's a code

252
00:14:33,442 --> 00:14:36,556
switch, predictive coding is like saying

253
00:14:36,738 --> 00:14:38,364
we're not even going to touch the

254
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:42,290
semantics of what the sign is itself.

255
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,144
We're just going to hypothesize that the

256
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:48,352
way that information about the sign is

257
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:51,292
transferred is through this maximum

258
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:54,212
information signaling approach called

259
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:56,544
predictive coding. Because predictive

260
00:14:56,592 --> 00:14:59,872
coding arose out of video compression

261
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:03,076
algorithms and only at the end of the

262
00:15:03,098 --> 00:15:05,764
90s was found to be increasingly

263
00:15:05,812 --> 00:15:08,632
relevant for neural circuitry and so on.

264
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:10,904
So it's another example of where like a

265
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:14,440
process based approach

266
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,820
ends up deflating or

267
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,940
reframing the otherwise

268
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,110
semantically loaded question.

269
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,500
It's like switching out the question of

270
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,276
where we're going to be with how we're

271
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,032
going to get there. And instead of only

272
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:38,172
focusing on the meaning of the signs

273
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:39,648
first off, as if the meaning of the

274
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:41,344
signs could be discussed outside of

275
00:15:41,382 --> 00:15:44,956
their implementation. And then even

276
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:46,624
if we could figure out what the signs

277
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:49,316
were, we would then just turn around and

278
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:51,296
want to know how they were transmitted.

279
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:53,824
And so predictive coding or predictive

280
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:56,840
processing in a way short circuits that

281
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,432
or inverts it by first looking to

282
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:03,380
explain how information is transmitted

283
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,804
that could support semiotics and

284
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,672
then in the context of biological

285
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:13,020
systems we naturally have biosemiotics.

286
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,586
Yeah, I would ask the question when you

287
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:21,726
talk about information being transmitted

288
00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:23,718
right, what that actually means. And I

289
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:26,582
think that's a very big topic and a very

290
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:31,814
large discussion in terms of information

291
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:34,154
theory when specifically applying that

292
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:38,230
into biological systems.

293
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,522
I think there are some interesting

294
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:42,842
people working on information that makes

295
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:46,174
the case that Shannon has a point and

296
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:49,886
he's really interested not in

297
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,406
the semantics or in the meaning or

298
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,070
anything else. He's kind of interested

299
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,806
in the problem of transmission. And when

300
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:59,778
you talk about transmission, it's worth

301
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:03,346
to ask what is being transmitted exactly

302
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:06,894
in the terms of signals, even if you're

303
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,106
capturing specific patterns and you

304
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,254
think that the pattern is the thing that

305
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:14,280
will be transmitted in that sense.

306
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:20,246
But that will be a

307
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:26,202
worth asking question to understand this

308
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:28,650
notion of what is actually being

309
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,122
transmitted in that sense. This

310
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,666
information theory is focusing on this

311
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:37,402
notion of the problem of transmission

312
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:39,726
and then all the concepts that come

313
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:41,646
along to explain that in terms of

314
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:44,640
uncertainty or noise and everything that

315
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,910
impacts these transmissional processes.

316
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,914
And if

317
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:56,302
you're saying like we're transmitting

318
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,002
information in this sense that is

319
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:01,462
breaking this semantic code

320
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:04,134
apart yes it is. Because the problem is

321
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:07,122
not focused on that. It's that focusing

322
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,454
on the specific correlations that we

323
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:13,630
have that we call they were mentioning

324
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,114
as information and how these

325
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:18,810
correlations are an issue

326
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,914
from the get go, from what is being

327
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:24,902
picked up in one side being correlated

328
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:27,040
to what comes into the other side.

329
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,878
How do you lose or gain more information

330
00:18:30,964 --> 00:18:36,094
in that? But the

331
00:18:36,132 --> 00:18:41,086
deeper question here is how

332
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:42,402
can you say that you are actually

333
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,226
gaining or losing that information

334
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:45,634
because you are defining this

335
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:47,426
correlation that could be transmitted or

336
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:50,958
not from the get go? If you don't have

337
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:54,120
that, you don't have anything being

338
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,150
actually communicated.

339
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:02,086
So with that in mind, you can explain

340
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:04,090
these concepts in terms of function,

341
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,542
and then there's a bunch of theories

342
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:12,934
that navigate this sense of signaling

343
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:16,038
that is specifically only functional.

344
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:23,006
And then predictive coding tries

345
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,900
to push that a little further, maybe.

346
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:31,358
But then you have to explain in

347
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:33,654
a deep sense how this information is

348
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:34,934
being actually transmitted and

349
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:36,534
processed. And I don't think that is

350
00:19:36,572 --> 00:19:39,894
really as obvious and as clear as we

351
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:40,920
think it is.

352
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,432
Specifically when we're talking about

353
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:50,060
this biological way of nature,

354
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:55,856
navigating this signaling we

355
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:57,776
have to talk about because the

356
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:01,276
correlation, if it's defined abenishi

357
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:05,284
from the beginning, then only have this

358
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:07,236
kind of transmission for someone

359
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:09,608
specific that can be able to understand

360
00:20:09,694 --> 00:20:12,010
that in the other side. Right?

361
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,320
Well, certainly whether we're talking

362
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,692
about a chemical pheromone that

363
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:24,668
requires some type of receptor or

364
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:27,992
something more ephemeral like language

365
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:30,872
that requires more of a semantic

366
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:35,916
reference frame, there's no receiving

367
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:37,628
the message without the sender. It's

368
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:39,648
like they're kind of the two sides of

369
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:42,976
the phone call. I'll ask a question from

370
00:20:42,998 --> 00:20:46,240
the chat? Love evolve.

371
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,052
How about cultural encoding and

372
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:52,724
principles in contrast to

373
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:56,710
organizational? So how do we think about

374
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,840
cultural meaning?

375
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,872
And is that similar or different than

376
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:06,200
organizational?

377
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,348
That's a good point. Right. I think if

378
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:14,750
you take very seriously the example from

379
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,260
the forestry is a practice,

380
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,692
then I think it has to be

381
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:25,276
organizational in that sense, the

382
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:28,560
meaning navigate this organizational

383
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,600
practice, this organizational story that

384
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,030
impacts not only

385
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,590
communication between agents but also

386
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,860
how the environment will be interpreted.

387
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,884
In this sense, it will be transmitted

388
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:55,336
and repeated over time because it has a

389
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:57,688
history. You cannot ignore the history

390
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:01,188
of these practices being pushed further

391
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:03,668
and replicated through generations.

392
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:10,504
Right. So the

393
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:15,032
way the villages will be organized

394
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:17,024
in terms of that specific practice, for

395
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:19,296
instance, can be understood in a

396
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:21,760
meaningful and cultural way that

397
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:26,092
organizes life in virtue

398
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:29,936
of some specific

399
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:34,380
principles that sensitizes

400
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,340
our agents towards specific directions.

401
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:52,688
And I think I

402
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:54,290
don't know if you get my point.

403
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,330
For instance, you can talk about,

404
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,834
if you think about archaeological

405
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:12,670
findings and how archaeological

406
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,866
descriptions of specific villages and

407
00:23:16,888 --> 00:23:20,820
how they navigate this mapping out

408
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,246
these archaeological sites.

409
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:30,534
They usually know exactly if you have

410
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:33,590
some kind of history already from these

411
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,934
communities, how that city will be

412
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:40,050
likely to be organized. First off,

413
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,034
where is the water? And if the water is

414
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:45,994
in certain directions, probably there

415
00:23:46,032 --> 00:23:48,694
will be certain kinds of relationships

416
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:52,154
with housing and communal housings and

417
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:55,070
where they're going to place their dead

418
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,046
in relation to this kind of specific

419
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,886
organizational principle. The water is

420
00:23:59,908 --> 00:24:03,134
here, so plantations will be not so far

421
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:06,894
away from that. And the city organizes

422
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:08,994
like the village organizes a little bit

423
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,300
in this sense and that builds up

424
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,674
cultural practices, at least

425
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:16,706
archaeologically, can be explained as

426
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:20,534
such. I thought

427
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:24,290
of something similar organization

428
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,470
being the logistical or the operational

429
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,250
structural aspects. So those would be

430
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,270
the roads that connect the forestry

431
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,634
outposts or the circulatory system that

432
00:24:38,672 --> 00:24:40,522
connects the different organs of

433
00:24:40,576 --> 00:24:45,054
organization. And then the culture is

434
00:24:45,252 --> 00:24:48,318
a cause and a consequence of

435
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:51,694
organization. Organization is

436
00:24:51,732 --> 00:24:53,966
the enabling conditions for culture to

437
00:24:53,988 --> 00:24:56,530
arise. Okay, so given this road network,

438
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,914
what cultures arise? How similar or

439
00:25:00,952 --> 00:25:02,706
different are they convergently? What

440
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:05,566
are their practices or their narratives

441
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:07,202
that are shared amongst these different

442
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,962
outposts? Or in the bodily example,

443
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:13,334
okay, given the organization of the

444
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:16,806
organs, literally the organizing process

445
00:25:16,908 --> 00:25:20,574
or principle, then what biosemiotics

446
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:23,626
can arise with glucose and insulin and

447
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:27,530
glucagon? And what culturally can arise,

448
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,822
maybe even in terms of the generative

449
00:25:30,886 --> 00:25:35,166
model of encultured agents as

450
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:36,894
a function of organization? And then

451
00:25:36,932 --> 00:25:40,606
what do those encultured agents do to

452
00:25:40,628 --> 00:25:42,510
the extent that they can modify

453
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,100
organization? And so these kinds of

454
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:52,990
unrolling cause and consequence

455
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,810
relationships can be hard to disentangle

456
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,206
because there's not like a clean single

457
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:03,510
starting point that can be

458
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,930
separated out or because it unfolds

459
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:07,990
historically,

460
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,026
it's not exactly a

461
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:15,850
reaction in a test tube.

462
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,362
So how does active inference give us an

463
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:23,710
entry point into thinking

464
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,958
about this? Yeah,

465
00:26:27,124 --> 00:26:29,374
that's one interesting thing about

466
00:26:29,412 --> 00:26:35,418
active inference that you

467
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:37,170
don't really need an origin point,

468
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,514
right? You can start modeling and start

469
00:26:40,552 --> 00:26:43,298
understanding that at any given point

470
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:46,194
and build up from that story and see how

471
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:48,760
it unfolds over time.

472
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,046
I think that's the most beautiful idea,

473
00:26:53,148 --> 00:26:55,814
that you define your parameters and then

474
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:58,374
you see from that parameters that can be

475
00:26:58,412 --> 00:27:01,210
arbitrarily defined and you can navigate

476
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,122
how things change within those

477
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:06,538
parameters in the generative model,

478
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,654
right. When you have your dynamical

479
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:11,386
systems, for instance, you have your

480
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:14,734
state space, they have some specific

481
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:18,234
range of defining

482
00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:21,834
parameters that set the limits

483
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:23,918
of the possible states that you're going

484
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:27,970
to navigate. And if you use this notion

485
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,306
that these two densities brings about

486
00:27:32,488 --> 00:27:35,810
in terms of Bayesian modeling, you can

487
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,926
use these kinds of tools to understand

488
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:44,230
how from that specific parameters update

489
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,114
what we narrate in active inference,

490
00:27:48,162 --> 00:27:51,862
as if belief updating can change over

491
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,100
time in these terms.

492
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,274
That's a very nice point. It reminds me

493
00:27:59,312 --> 00:28:02,902
of Bruno Latour's Actor Network Theory,

494
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:06,046
or Ant, which kind of advocates a

495
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:07,578
similar approach to what you described,

496
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:10,030
which is like enter anywhere open

497
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,470
mindedly, because in an Iterated

498
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,010
modeling or Iterated analysis setting,

499
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,990
the first proposal or the first trace

500
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,954
detected, we know that's not the whole

501
00:28:23,992 --> 00:28:26,066
picture. There may not be a whole or

502
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:27,846
only picture. So we need to enter and

503
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:29,986
iterate and then with active inference,

504
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:32,454
specifically because of the

505
00:28:32,492 --> 00:28:34,518
compositionality that we get within a

506
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:37,094
layer, collective behavior, and then

507
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,506
also the kind of nesting smaller things

508
00:28:40,608 --> 00:28:44,858
inside of bigger things, we can always

509
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:48,282
build something and then we can go,

510
00:28:48,336 --> 00:28:49,994
oh wow, it's like there's a lot of top

511
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:53,150
down influence. Maybe there's a higher

512
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,806
order factor or slower factor or a

513
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:58,494
contextual factor we should consider or

514
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:02,814
oh, we were abstracting across these

515
00:29:02,932 --> 00:29:06,482
smaller things inside. But for a later

516
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:10,180
day or if relevant, we can dive in.

517
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,858
And so then it

518
00:29:14,024 --> 00:29:17,810
allows a light hold or a grasp

519
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,094
on the proposed generative model.

520
00:29:21,212 --> 00:29:24,102
Obviously, it's map, not territory. But

521
00:29:24,156 --> 00:29:26,566
even beyond that, we always know that we

522
00:29:26,588 --> 00:29:30,550
can expand laterally and across scales

523
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,930
starting from anywhere in an Iterated

524
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,634
modeling process without our first

525
00:29:40,752 --> 00:29:44,410
or even 11th model being proposed

526
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,010
as, like, the accounts of some complex

527
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,462
cultural phenomena which we're always

528
00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:52,494
going to only ever have our own

529
00:29:52,532 --> 00:29:56,238
perspectives on. Yeah, I think you don't

530
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:58,882
really find that in being so all

531
00:29:58,936 --> 00:30:01,042
encompassing. Like you have one model

532
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:03,060
that will model them all.

533
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,422
You can navigate those models in these

534
00:30:07,576 --> 00:30:10,882
more instrumental terms. It raises

535
00:30:10,946 --> 00:30:12,534
different questions when you put things

536
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:15,222
like that in terms of geontology of

537
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:18,454
models and models and theories and

538
00:30:18,492 --> 00:30:20,886
sciences, but they can be also described

539
00:30:20,918 --> 00:30:26,144
as tools

540
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:29,984
for describe tools for grasping

541
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:34,296
and describing phenomena in

542
00:30:34,318 --> 00:30:37,690
a more non committal way,

543
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,464
how much that how much

544
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:47,524
that smuggles in philosophical

545
00:30:47,572 --> 00:30:49,596
or moral ontological problems. It is

546
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:59,548
still, I think, under debate, but it

547
00:30:59,554 --> 00:31:02,464
is still told. You bring insights to

548
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:07,200
think about specific cultural collective

549
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,200
phenomena, which is not it's complicated

550
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,804
because I think what I'm getting at,

551
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:16,512
I'm kind of like going back and forth.

552
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:18,368
But when you talk about social sciences

553
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:21,396
and modeling, usually you have ways of

554
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:24,376
modeling modeling agents or ways of

555
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:26,516
modeling collectives and active

556
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:29,656
inferences, trying to come

557
00:31:29,678 --> 00:31:32,072
up with a modeling in which you can

558
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:35,080
understand agency and collectives within

559
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,780
the same modeling schema.

560
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,428
And I think specifically for these

561
00:31:42,514 --> 00:31:44,444
cases, if you're interested in

562
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:47,736
understanding types of cultural

563
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:53,452
phenomena among language users in

564
00:31:53,506 --> 00:31:56,432
specific contexts, you can at least

565
00:31:56,486 --> 00:31:59,584
partially understand or gain some

566
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:02,352
insight in this agent collective

567
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:05,668
relationship that is a

568
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:09,044
little bit more interesting than we have

569
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:11,456
found so far in the social sciences,

570
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:14,260
because you can have our specific

571
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,584
understandings of memes. But then how

572
00:32:16,622 --> 00:32:19,576
the agent? Where is the agency in that?

573
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:23,672
You lose a little bit of agency when

574
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:28,124
you're trying to understand only

575
00:32:28,242 --> 00:32:30,396
agents. Then you don't know how that

576
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:33,576
kind of scales up because active

577
00:32:33,608 --> 00:32:37,240
inference tries and offers these scale

578
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,392
free modeling tools that

579
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:46,364
facilitate this conversion

580
00:32:46,412 --> 00:32:50,240
into agents and collectives.

581
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,100
I would be interested in asking you,

582
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,004
actually, how do you navigate that when

583
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:01,524
you talk about social phenomena in

584
00:33:01,722 --> 00:33:03,620
ants or termites?

585
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,820
Because then you have very specific

586
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:16,300
coding demarcations, I guess, for these

587
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,870
social environments.

588
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,450
Yeah, it's a great question. It's also

589
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:32,204
whether it's an open wound or

590
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:35,120
a dirty closet that's just shut.

591
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,132
There's actually a lot of ambiguity and

592
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:40,390
unresolved tension around.

593
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,828
Well, is the ant colony social?

594
00:33:43,914 --> 00:33:47,576
Are they social insects that reifies the

595
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:50,744
nest mate as the individual? And then

596
00:33:50,782 --> 00:33:52,548
what they're doing is like when we hang

597
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:55,716
out and talk. So reifying the nest

598
00:33:55,748 --> 00:33:57,604
mate as individual makes the colony

599
00:33:57,652 --> 00:34:00,590
social. But if the colony is individual,

600
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,836
then what nest mates are doing with each

601
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:06,396
other is not social any more than we

602
00:34:06,418 --> 00:34:08,184
would describe the liver and the kidney

603
00:34:08,232 --> 00:34:10,460
as having like a social single cellular

604
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,936
interaction. But we know that would be

605
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:15,104
missing the point. And so there

606
00:34:15,142 --> 00:34:17,936
definitely is attention with some of

607
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:20,620
these evolutionary lineages, like ants

608
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,780
being monophyletically obligate usocial

609
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,608
all. And only ants are

610
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:30,704
eusocial they all live in the colonies.

611
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:33,984
There's no free living nest mate whereas

612
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:37,240
other parts of the evolutionary tree

613
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,936
there are life histories that

614
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:44,440
do look a little bit more like social

615
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:48,040
collaboration that can then dissolve.

616
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,350
And so knowing what level of lock in

617
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,590
makes something social.

618
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,224
When are we socializing? And what level

619
00:35:00,262 --> 00:35:03,728
of lock in goes beyond social. And it

620
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,952
kind of like makes when the blanket is

621
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:10,224
so strong around the social that

622
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:13,924
like for multicellularity that

623
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:17,680
it's kind of losing the social feature

624
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,948
again because if we just use social

625
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:22,836
to mean the connective tissue or the

626
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:25,350
kind of lubricant or the spaces between

627
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,136
everything, then it means

628
00:35:30,318 --> 00:35:33,800
nothing. So a real

629
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,428
tension is what space

630
00:35:37,614 --> 00:35:39,950
does the social account for?

631
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,144
And is this going to be a concept

632
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:48,456
with a lot of creep looking? Well, it's

633
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:51,324
a social relationship between the roots

634
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:54,416
of the tree and the fungus and it's a

635
00:35:54,438 --> 00:35:56,752
social relationship amongst the

636
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:58,992
molecules in the test tube. Is that too

637
00:35:59,046 --> 00:36:01,120
broad of a social conception?

638
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,324
Are there downsides or

639
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:08,436
are there trade offs associated with a

640
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:12,176
broader social concept? Do we dilute

641
00:36:12,288 --> 00:36:14,196
what the social means? And then on the

642
00:36:14,218 --> 00:36:19,748
other side, might we exclude phenomena

643
00:36:19,924 --> 00:36:22,084
that could importantly be considered

644
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:25,112
social? Well, that's not social,

645
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,408
they're just talking on a train. It's

646
00:36:27,444 --> 00:36:29,356
like well that's the other side. If we

647
00:36:29,378 --> 00:36:33,832
were to have carving out encounters

648
00:36:33,896 --> 00:36:35,724
that we do want to include as a social

649
00:36:35,842 --> 00:36:39,470
and is there a true social?

650
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,280
Does active inference help us sidestep

651
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,720
or at least negotiate this territory?

652
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,804
Because we could develop a generative

653
00:36:51,852 --> 00:36:53,456
model or an ecosystem of shared

654
00:36:53,488 --> 00:36:57,590
intelligence with one person and

655
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,676
two internet of things devices and a

656
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:04,612
bird and a metronome and

657
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:08,312
just say we made what we made and then

658
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:10,136
leave it as a second order

659
00:37:10,238 --> 00:37:14,410
interpretation whether that is a social

660
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,040
setting.

661
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,908
I mean, I think you are pointing at the

662
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:26,316
granularity of those scales, right? If

663
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:28,364
you have a model that one to one to

664
00:37:28,402 --> 00:37:30,216
everything that you already have, it's

665
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,032
probably not interesting and not

666
00:37:32,086 --> 00:37:34,972
informative because you cannot define

667
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:38,384
those limits of what you're trying to

668
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,728
understand. And in the other hand, when

669
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:43,584
you do that, when you define those

670
00:37:43,622 --> 00:37:46,988
limits, if you're too narrow or you're

671
00:37:47,004 --> 00:37:49,028
going to leave out you're going to

672
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:51,204
idealize also in a way, right, and leave

673
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:53,876
out many other parts of the system that

674
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:56,996
you're interested in. But if you don't

675
00:37:57,028 --> 00:37:57,850
do that,

676
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,568
if you don't make this decision, if you

677
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,436
don't make this decision when modeling

678
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:10,108
anything then how you can

679
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:15,036
have any access to the

680
00:38:15,058 --> 00:38:18,284
phenomena, right? And to connect this to

681
00:38:18,322 --> 00:38:20,670
the forestry so in the forestry example,

682
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,076
the desirada was lumber.

683
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:29,324
Now that may have been a very narrowly

684
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:32,956
scoped desire, but it's a relevant

685
00:38:32,988 --> 00:38:37,076
thing to want this resource. And then

686
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:40,470
industrialization science as a process

687
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,788
professionalization those allowed the

688
00:38:44,874 --> 00:38:47,832
description and the handling and

689
00:38:47,886 --> 00:38:50,090
ultimately the kind of top down

690
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,728
legibility and control thinking like a

691
00:38:52,734 --> 00:38:56,376
forestry company. Now with respect to

692
00:38:56,398 --> 00:38:59,404
the social sciences by analogy to

693
00:38:59,442 --> 00:39:02,168
forestry science. So now we're entering

694
00:39:02,184 --> 00:39:04,684
an era of increased legibility and

695
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:09,310
control of social systems and

696
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,856
human natural capital and attention as a

697
00:39:13,878 --> 00:39:17,936
resource, trust as a resource in

698
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:21,984
a way is being cropped analogous to

699
00:39:22,022 --> 00:39:25,092
produce the content of lumber. But now

700
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:28,212
there are social contents. So as the

701
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:32,212
social goes from being just only

702
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:35,252
simply the water we swim in. Not

703
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,612
something that's even compared

704
00:39:36,676 --> 00:39:40,564
counterfactually to alternative cultural

705
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:45,690
possibilities per se, but falls under

706
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,736
the scope of the professional

707
00:39:48,788 --> 00:39:52,428
management. Like forestry then

708
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:54,332
that's. When this discussion of, well,

709
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:56,648
what's the lumber and what is the weeds

710
00:39:56,664 --> 00:40:00,184
that are being pruned and what ecosystem

711
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:03,744
services, when we pay attention to

712
00:40:03,782 --> 00:40:07,600
certain parts of human social culture,

713
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,984
and when we seek to make more of this

714
00:40:12,022 --> 00:40:13,200
kind of lumber,

715
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,270
what else does that come along with?

716
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,564
And what decisions come

717
00:40:22,602 --> 00:40:26,228
into play. That comes along

718
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:28,630
when you see the process?

719
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,244
Or Instagram? I don't know. Twitter?

720
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,860
After what happened to Twitter.

721
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,860
But yeah, in terms of attention

722
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,264
pruning, you do have that very

723
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:17,824
effectively already happening. You can

724
00:41:17,862 --> 00:41:21,696
see how that happens efficiently in the

725
00:41:21,718 --> 00:41:24,832
voting elections for instance. It can be

726
00:41:24,886 --> 00:41:28,244
very easily manipulated and we saw what

727
00:41:28,282 --> 00:41:31,044
happened in elections for instance in

728
00:41:31,082 --> 00:41:35,764
Brazil or in the well

729
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:36,790
all over.

730
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,616
You navigate a system of attention

731
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:50,724
organization that selects in only what

732
00:41:50,762 --> 00:41:52,750
he thinks that your interested in,

733
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,740
in the effect of that in terms of

734
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,060
decision making and in terms of trust,

735
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:05,564
in terms of diversity

736
00:42:05,612 --> 00:42:08,464
of discourse, we have seen that it can

737
00:42:08,502 --> 00:42:10,000
be devastating.

738
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,828
The question would be like how can

739
00:42:16,854 --> 00:42:19,536
you use active inference and these tools

740
00:42:19,568 --> 00:42:22,884
that we have to make this kind

741
00:42:22,922 --> 00:42:24,484
of technology a little bit more

742
00:42:24,522 --> 00:42:26,884
inclusive without being super, also

743
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:30,970
disruptive? Is it even like

744
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,988
a possibility? I really don't know. I

745
00:42:38,994 --> 00:42:40,556
think it's an ethical problem that we

746
00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:43,112
have when we talk about social systems

747
00:42:43,256 --> 00:42:45,652
and these principles of attention

748
00:42:45,736 --> 00:42:47,890
exclusion, leaving things out.

749
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,810
Lot to say on that.

750
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,608
With modeling and interpolating and

751
00:43:03,774 --> 00:43:05,896
models, whether it's large language

752
00:43:05,928 --> 00:43:08,350
model type or linear regression type,

753
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,344
it is able to interpolate

754
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:18,960
to put data points within an enclosure

755
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,370
of what has already been described. And

756
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,216
Bayesian statistics and other types of

757
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:27,136
prediction algorithms are not immune to

758
00:43:27,158 --> 00:43:30,432
that either. If we have some prior

759
00:43:30,496 --> 00:43:34,324
distribution belief, we believe

760
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,324
it's possible for it to be between 20

761
00:43:36,362 --> 00:43:38,070
and 30 degrees outside.

762
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,064
Then when we get data inside of our

763
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:45,828
bounds we can converge

764
00:43:46,004 --> 00:43:49,220
and that actually tightens our beliefs.

765
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,784
Not always a bad thing of course. And

766
00:43:51,822 --> 00:43:53,816
then outside of the scope of the

767
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:56,732
possible, those data are just seen as

768
00:43:56,786 --> 00:43:59,132
noise and they may not even be

769
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:00,956
integrated. So then that can lead to a

770
00:44:00,978 --> 00:44:04,584
reinforcing process, not necessarily

771
00:44:04,632 --> 00:44:07,144
an adaptive one either, where

772
00:44:07,282 --> 00:44:09,968
information that's confirmatory is used

773
00:44:10,054 --> 00:44:13,456
to ratchet and increase precision and

774
00:44:13,478 --> 00:44:15,152
then information that is not

775
00:44:15,206 --> 00:44:18,832
confirmatory is discarded as not

776
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:19,680
useful.

777
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,424
In this case it doesn't even enter the

778
00:44:29,462 --> 00:44:32,944
landscape of attention of the

779
00:44:32,982 --> 00:44:33,680
user.

780
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:45,134
What I was thinking in relation to this

781
00:44:45,172 --> 00:44:48,958
idea of forestry

782
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:53,138
is because we have now

783
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:56,258
organizational principles that are

784
00:44:56,424 --> 00:45:01,174
faster and more

785
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:05,180
populated with information and

786
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:10,970
attention grabbing kinds of prompts.

787
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:21,094
We transform the same we

788
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:32,076
transform the same principle into a

789
00:45:32,098 --> 00:45:34,990
harder to grasp process.

790
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,584
It becomes more complex. It becomes

791
00:45:38,632 --> 00:45:42,060
harder to describe the process

792
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,736
of understanding that in terms of

793
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:47,500
forestry is kind of way more grounded.

794
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,824
When you apply that socially to this

795
00:45:49,862 --> 00:45:53,296
kind of environment that we're talking

796
00:45:53,478 --> 00:45:56,800
like internet or this highly

797
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,804
volatile and

798
00:46:04,922 --> 00:46:07,824
virtual in principle environment,

799
00:46:07,952 --> 00:46:11,168
it becomes much harder to assess what is

800
00:46:11,194 --> 00:46:13,476
being pruned out or not. You just don't

801
00:46:13,508 --> 00:46:17,976
know. It makes it more clear that there

802
00:46:17,998 --> 00:46:19,912
is a process of pruning. You need to

803
00:46:19,966 --> 00:46:22,060
have no control of what is being taken

804
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:25,390
out. You have no idea what's being

805
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,484
left away from your perspective of

806
00:46:29,522 --> 00:46:30,220
attention.

807
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,556
So to this topic of intended

808
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:39,890
or unintended semantic pruning, I think

809
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,580
this has helped me identify attention.

810
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,584
If we want to talk about the semantics

811
00:46:46,652 --> 00:46:48,836
or semiotics biosomiotics, whatever we

812
00:46:48,858 --> 00:46:52,340
want to call it, of the letter E

813
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,536
in relationship to letter A, we're

814
00:46:55,568 --> 00:46:58,916
looking for an account that might

815
00:46:59,018 --> 00:47:02,544
convey leterness. But we're generalized

816
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:06,116
above enis or anus. So in

817
00:47:06,138 --> 00:47:08,304
some ways we've erased or abstracted

818
00:47:08,352 --> 00:47:12,444
generalized away from the particulars of

819
00:47:12,642 --> 00:47:16,684
the sign meaning by

820
00:47:16,802 --> 00:47:19,420
taking a semiotic perspective.

821
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,056
And so it's like we got into the game

822
00:47:25,238 --> 00:47:29,084
to have a semantic account of biological

823
00:47:29,132 --> 00:47:32,336
phenomena or of any phenomena for a

824
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:37,028
biological entity. Yet this

825
00:47:37,114 --> 00:47:40,710
process in a sense

826
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,140
distances us from the particulars that

827
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:49,396
actually do grant it that meaning in

828
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:52,296
the actuality. Like if we walk into a

829
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:54,552
sacred space and it's like oh well,

830
00:47:54,606 --> 00:47:57,336
that is just doing that over there and

831
00:47:57,358 --> 00:47:59,912
this architecture is doing this and

832
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:01,836
because of the layout people must use

833
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:03,070
the room this way.

834
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,052
That's removed from

835
00:48:09,106 --> 00:48:14,304
the actual meaning which

836
00:48:14,342 --> 00:48:16,544
is the cause and consequence with the

837
00:48:16,582 --> 00:48:18,704
organization and culture that we

838
00:48:18,742 --> 00:48:22,524
discussed. But that prima fascia

839
00:48:22,572 --> 00:48:26,636
account doesn't

840
00:48:26,668 --> 00:48:30,116
generalize yet any generalization that

841
00:48:30,138 --> 00:48:32,692
we make so that we can talk about

842
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:35,716
multiple places or multiple letters on a

843
00:48:35,738 --> 00:48:38,676
common accounting framework is going to

844
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:40,840
remove those particularities.

845
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,416
So it's a very challenging catch 22.

846
00:48:47,598 --> 00:48:51,384
Whether we want to really account for

847
00:48:51,422 --> 00:48:55,052
the N equals one and maybe even live

848
00:48:55,106 --> 00:48:57,884
and act and play and work in the N

849
00:48:57,922 --> 00:49:01,196
equals one versus develop something that

850
00:49:01,218 --> 00:49:03,820
might be satisfying and cut and dry,

851
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,968
but it's always going to be on the

852
00:49:05,974 --> 00:49:08,144
sidelines with respect to what it

853
00:49:08,342 --> 00:49:09,810
actually means.

854
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,384
But what do you mean? I don't understand

855
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,704
what you're getting at. Is it you mean

856
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:22,212
it's generalized or not generalized? I

857
00:49:22,266 --> 00:49:26,260
didn't get that. When we generalize,

858
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,320
when we ask what words

859
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:35,112
mean, what words mean beyond any given

860
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,744
word, we've lost touch with what any

861
00:49:36,782 --> 00:49:38,090
given word means.

862
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,156
But words are what they actually mean in

863
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:48,364
a situation. So it's just in this

864
00:49:48,562 --> 00:49:52,744
scientific approach to meaning semiotics

865
00:49:52,792 --> 00:49:58,304
and semantics we

866
00:49:58,342 --> 00:50:02,064
have these two tensions or a

867
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:05,376
tension to. Reconcile between actually

868
00:50:05,478 --> 00:50:08,000
giving an account of the meaningfulness

869
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,392
of the specific thing versus

870
00:50:13,456 --> 00:50:15,664
taking a more scientific approach,

871
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:18,596
which would be gathering a group of

872
00:50:18,618 --> 00:50:22,392
similar things and finding their

873
00:50:22,446 --> 00:50:25,736
shared attributes, which out

874
00:50:25,758 --> 00:50:28,452
of necessity must abstract, must crop

875
00:50:28,516 --> 00:50:32,170
out features that

876
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:38,472
are empirically or anecdotally

877
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,192
taken to not matter. Like, we abstract

878
00:50:41,256 --> 00:50:42,828
whether it was a Monday or Tuesday that

879
00:50:42,834 --> 00:50:45,544
we did the experiment. We just combine

880
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:47,328
all of our replicates together when we

881
00:50:47,334 --> 00:50:49,040
do the scientific analysis.

882
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,788
You mean if you generalize the practice,

883
00:50:56,884 --> 00:51:00,076
you lose what you've been? If you

884
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,976
generalize it too much, you lose

885
00:51:02,008 --> 00:51:03,468
everything that's meaningful to you in

886
00:51:03,474 --> 00:51:07,836
terms of, like you formalize it and

887
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:11,384
then you have an empty semantics.

888
00:51:11,432 --> 00:51:13,368
You have a semantics with no meaning

889
00:51:13,464 --> 00:51:15,824
that can only be meaningful in terms of

890
00:51:15,862 --> 00:51:18,048
how you apply that in terms of specific

891
00:51:18,134 --> 00:51:20,368
practices. Yeah, it's like I have a

892
00:51:20,374 --> 00:51:22,912
framework for the formal meaning of

893
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:24,872
letters within words, within sentences,

894
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,436
within paragraphs. And then it's like,

895
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,232
well, but now what's? Your next N equals

896
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:31,044
one word that you're actually going to

897
00:51:31,082 --> 00:51:34,676
bring? It's not just

898
00:51:34,698 --> 00:51:37,540
about building some abstract scaffold

899
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,096
for bigger and bigger boulders of

900
00:51:41,118 --> 00:51:44,104
meaning. At some point, through our

901
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:48,856
embodied thought and action in

902
00:51:48,878 --> 00:51:50,620
our experience, it is going to come down

903
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,300
into the particulars,

904
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,852
and it doesn't immediately seem clear

905
00:51:55,906 --> 00:52:01,576
that simply generalizing further brings

906
00:52:01,608 --> 00:52:02,510
us there.

907
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:07,664
Yeah, I don't really believe you can

908
00:52:07,782 --> 00:52:10,816
have that kind of generalization. I

909
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:14,524
think we attempt to

910
00:52:14,582 --> 00:52:17,572
build whatever what I see that's the

911
00:52:17,626 --> 00:52:19,296
interesting aspect of the formal

912
00:52:19,328 --> 00:52:22,004
thematics. You try to build this more

913
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:26,736
general understanding

914
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:30,296
that just formalizes to model, but for

915
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:32,824
that to be meaningful, it has to be

916
00:52:32,862 --> 00:52:36,072
embedded in a way of practicing it,

917
00:52:36,126 --> 00:52:39,256
like in a forestry practice. It has to

918
00:52:39,278 --> 00:52:41,416
be embedded in a cultural environment in

919
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:46,312
which that can be actually observed

920
00:52:46,376 --> 00:52:49,884
in terms of what happens when a

921
00:52:49,922 --> 00:52:52,736
generative model is being updated or

922
00:52:52,758 --> 00:52:53,330
not.

923
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,244
Is that what you mean? Because otherwise

924
00:52:57,292 --> 00:53:04,396
I don't really understand how it

925
00:53:04,438 --> 00:53:06,308
becomes too formal. It becomes too

926
00:53:06,394 --> 00:53:09,604
abstract in terms of some I would not

927
00:53:09,642 --> 00:53:10,950
understand what that is.

928
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,212
I'll think a little more Brynn or TJ.

929
00:53:19,356 --> 00:53:22,390
Do you want to add any thoughts or

930
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,028
questions? Yeah, sorry.

931
00:53:27,194 --> 00:53:29,904
I think I don't have a lot of context.

932
00:53:29,952 --> 00:53:31,620
I've been following some of the

933
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:34,488
discussion but not attended a lot of

934
00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:36,810
these calls. It's all.

935
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:45,244
Yeah, I don't know. I think I'm,

936
00:53:45,282 --> 00:53:47,356
in general, just sort of interested in

937
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,404
trying to understand the relationship

938
00:53:49,522 --> 00:53:54,008
between sorts

939
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:56,990
of constructionist epistemologies and

940
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,520
generative models and active inference

941
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:06,076
style stuff and how active

942
00:54:06,108 --> 00:54:08,256
inference style, like yeah. What are the

943
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,096
philosophical commitments that active

944
00:54:10,128 --> 00:54:12,276
inference involves with respect to

945
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:14,688
knowledge and epistemology? And there's

946
00:54:14,704 --> 00:54:17,504
a sense in which rational choice models

947
00:54:17,552 --> 00:54:20,710
often assume a certain sort of

948
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,336
objectivity to beliefs and then desires

949
00:54:24,368 --> 00:54:26,244
are where most of the degrees of freedom

950
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:29,848
lie or something. Whereas there's a lot

951
00:54:29,854 --> 00:54:31,624
of issue, like there's a lot of things

952
00:54:31,662 --> 00:54:33,192
that come up once you start talking

953
00:54:33,246 --> 00:54:36,424
about reflexivities where concepts

954
00:54:36,472 --> 00:54:37,896
themselves become self fulfilling

955
00:54:37,928 --> 00:54:41,528
prophecies, what your beliefs

956
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:43,836
about society ends up shaping the

957
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:45,676
society itself. So there's a sense in

958
00:54:45,698 --> 00:54:48,128
which there's this codependence between

959
00:54:48,214 --> 00:54:50,076
the object of knowledge and knowledge

960
00:54:50,108 --> 00:54:53,344
about that object itself. And I think

961
00:54:53,382 --> 00:54:56,416
yeah, I'm sort of interested in how the

962
00:54:56,438 --> 00:54:58,032
active entrance ways of thinking about

963
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:01,496
this offers what perspectives

964
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,750
on those questions and stuff like that.

965
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,910
Thank you. Great questions.

966
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:15,384
So when you talk about the object of

967
00:55:15,422 --> 00:55:18,824
knowledge and the knowledge itself and

968
00:55:19,022 --> 00:55:20,440
active inference,

969
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,864
I think you can think of in

970
00:55:32,902 --> 00:55:34,530
terms of this.

971
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:40,434
Well, there's a few ways to think about

972
00:55:40,472 --> 00:55:45,206
that. I guess the

973
00:55:45,228 --> 00:55:48,022
knowledge itself has to come

974
00:55:48,076 --> 00:55:51,126
epistemically from where your agent is

975
00:55:51,228 --> 00:55:53,858
actually embedded and situated.

976
00:55:53,954 --> 00:55:55,990
Specifically in active inference, it's

977
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:59,514
embodied. It kind of needs to have

978
00:55:59,552 --> 00:56:03,338
a model. The model is modeling a

979
00:56:03,344 --> 00:56:05,226
body is modeling a body that is in the

980
00:56:05,248 --> 00:56:08,842
world and it's all the time situated,

981
00:56:08,906 --> 00:56:12,074
is never disconnected to its environment

982
00:56:12,122 --> 00:56:15,982
and the history of that

983
00:56:16,036 --> 00:56:18,320
environment. Right, yeah.

984
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:23,154
But if you think if you push that to the

985
00:56:23,192 --> 00:56:26,980
object of that knowledge, I don't know

986
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:32,654
how different that

987
00:56:32,712 --> 00:56:36,230
will how different

988
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,838
how can you differentiate that so

989
00:56:38,924 --> 00:56:40,866
sharply when you talk about active

990
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:46,074
imprints? Because if

991
00:56:46,192 --> 00:56:49,706
you think of in

992
00:56:49,728 --> 00:56:52,746
terms of a generative model, what will

993
00:56:52,768 --> 00:56:56,682
be updated is updated from

994
00:56:56,736 --> 00:57:00,426
a prior that is always directed

995
00:57:00,538 --> 00:57:05,390
in this body, in this situated realm.

996
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:09,582
So they sort of conflated as I see,

997
00:57:09,636 --> 00:57:12,930
maybe I'm mistaken, but they sort of

998
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,094
conflate in how you're going to update

999
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:20,786
your generative model, which would be at

1000
00:57:20,808 --> 00:57:24,334
the same time what you know and what

1001
00:57:24,472 --> 00:57:26,310
the object of this knowledge?

1002
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,846
Sorry, if I can just raise a question to

1003
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:34,886
that. Yeah, so I think that there is a

1004
00:57:34,908 --> 00:57:38,154
sense in which with respect to

1005
00:57:38,352 --> 00:57:40,298
something that in epistemology would be

1006
00:57:40,304 --> 00:57:42,986
called self knowledge, there is a

1007
00:57:43,008 --> 00:57:45,302
question here that the active inference

1008
00:57:45,446 --> 00:57:48,974
agent has this model

1009
00:57:49,172 --> 00:57:52,526
that is situated in the body or in

1010
00:57:52,548 --> 00:57:56,538
its structure

1011
00:57:56,714 --> 00:57:58,666
and is also modeling that structure

1012
00:57:58,698 --> 00:58:05,186
itself. And there is this issue of the

1013
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:07,326
belief is not unidirectionally dependent

1014
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,266
on the object sort of a thing, but has

1015
00:58:09,288 --> 00:58:11,490
this feedback loop thing comes up there.

1016
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,600
But there's another way in which I think

1017
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,734
where this sort of thing comes, where

1018
00:58:17,852 --> 00:58:19,846
even if the object is outside of the

1019
00:58:19,868 --> 00:58:23,126
body of the knowledge, I think that

1020
00:58:23,148 --> 00:58:25,110
could still come up. So, for instance,

1021
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,626
if an active inference agent lives in a

1022
00:58:29,648 --> 00:58:32,934
society of other active inference

1023
00:58:32,982 --> 00:58:34,794
agents, where currently all of them

1024
00:58:34,832 --> 00:58:38,380
defect on prisoners dilemma, but maybe

1025
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,054
on further reflection, they would want

1026
00:58:41,092 --> 00:58:43,226
to again, I don't know what further

1027
00:58:43,258 --> 00:58:44,586
reflection would mean in the active

1028
00:58:44,618 --> 00:58:47,086
inference sense, but I'm just saying in

1029
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:50,562
the intuitive sense, what would it mean

1030
00:58:50,616 --> 00:58:53,346
for them to go from one fixed point to

1031
00:58:53,368 --> 00:58:54,754
another fixed point where they're all

1032
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:57,682
cooperating or something like that?

1033
00:58:57,736 --> 00:59:00,434
And that, I think,

1034
00:59:00,552 --> 00:59:03,026
is not clear to me. Like how that shift

1035
00:59:03,058 --> 00:59:05,254
can happen in active inference where

1036
00:59:05,452 --> 00:59:09,042
it's not just purely using the empirical

1037
00:59:09,106 --> 00:59:12,774
information to keep running the

1038
00:59:12,812 --> 00:59:17,130
mill of your free energy

1039
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,654
equation but also recognizing

1040
00:59:21,702 --> 00:59:25,014
the contingencies and then identifying

1041
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,018
those contingencies to make something

1042
00:59:27,104 --> 00:59:30,730
like shifts from one state to another.

1043
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,046
Like if I model that the society is a

1044
00:59:34,068 --> 00:59:35,966
cruel space and if everyone models a

1045
00:59:35,988 --> 00:59:38,094
society as a cruel space, then we will

1046
00:59:38,132 --> 00:59:39,998
end up creating a society that is a

1047
00:59:40,004 --> 00:59:42,514
cruel space. But if only we could

1048
00:59:42,552 --> 00:59:44,610
recognize that our belief or our model

1049
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,258
that society is a cool space is a

1050
00:59:46,264 --> 00:59:49,266
contingent belief and we could all

1051
00:59:49,448 --> 00:59:53,078
somehow negotiate or communicate and

1052
00:59:53,164 --> 00:59:56,486
shift to a different belief about what

1053
00:59:56,508 --> 00:59:58,694
society is and society is a kind place,

1054
00:59:58,732 --> 01:00:01,586
then we will end up creating that kinder

1055
01:00:01,618 --> 01:00:05,642
society or something. And that sort

1056
01:00:05,696 --> 01:00:08,314
of like a belief about the thing that

1057
01:00:08,352 --> 01:00:11,546
society is. It's not entirely within the

1058
01:00:11,568 --> 01:00:12,140
agent.

1059
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:16,566
It has a weird intersubjective

1060
01:00:16,598 --> 01:00:18,270
character. So it's not entirely outside

1061
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,494
of the agent either, but it's not

1062
01:00:20,532 --> 01:00:23,422
entirely internal to the agent either.

1063
01:00:23,476 --> 01:00:25,680
Or something. Yeah.

1064
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,738
You can think of that like you're

1065
01:00:29,754 --> 01:00:31,518
talking about active inference. Action

1066
01:00:31,614 --> 01:00:35,106
comes first, right? You don't have the

1067
01:00:35,128 --> 01:00:38,446
knowledge inside your head waiting

1068
01:00:38,478 --> 01:00:41,374
for you to push that out of the action

1069
01:00:41,422 --> 01:00:45,686
has to come first. So if

1070
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,622
you take that as a principle, an

1071
01:00:47,676 --> 01:00:50,566
organizing principle, it depends on the

1072
01:00:50,588 --> 01:00:52,614
contingency of your actions. The

1073
01:00:52,652 --> 01:00:54,630
possibilities might be limited by your

1074
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,038
situated condition,

1075
01:00:58,134 --> 01:01:01,066
but they are limited. It doesn't mean

1076
01:01:01,088 --> 01:01:03,946
that you don't have a range of options

1077
01:01:04,048 --> 01:01:07,526
from that state space in which you can

1078
01:01:07,568 --> 01:01:10,574
navigate. So you can navigate it for the

1079
01:01:10,612 --> 01:01:13,774
good or for the bad, but it starts with

1080
01:01:13,812 --> 01:01:17,054
the action perception loop, starts with

1081
01:01:17,092 --> 01:01:20,546
the action. All out.

1082
01:01:20,568 --> 01:01:24,242
A few other pieces on that. TJ very good

1083
01:01:24,296 --> 01:01:27,666
point. Like when we see the

1084
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:30,642
pragmatic component of action as self

1085
01:01:30,696 --> 01:01:34,446
fulfilling epistemic component of

1086
01:01:34,488 --> 01:01:35,954
action having to do with gaining

1087
01:01:36,002 --> 01:01:37,238
knowledge and the salience of

1088
01:01:37,244 --> 01:01:38,866
information. But the pragmatic component

1089
01:01:38,898 --> 01:01:41,222
is about bringing our observations into

1090
01:01:41,276 --> 01:01:43,846
alignment with our preferences. And then

1091
01:01:43,868 --> 01:01:46,726
you identified two related settings.

1092
01:01:46,838 --> 01:01:49,846
One of them is like pure intra

1093
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:53,706
subjectivity like I expect myself or I

1094
01:01:53,808 --> 01:01:56,250
find myself or I habitually think about

1095
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,582
x. Well, that's kind of a trivial self

1096
01:01:59,636 --> 01:02:01,630
fulfillment because thinking about

1097
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,510
something is its own fulfillment.

1098
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:07,758
And then when we're in this second

1099
01:02:07,844 --> 01:02:11,554
person or social space we

1100
01:02:11,592 --> 01:02:14,114
can agree on little performance art or

1101
01:02:14,152 --> 01:02:17,874
on a game and games give evidence to

1102
01:02:17,912 --> 01:02:21,106
that. That when people are able to

1103
01:02:21,128 --> 01:02:23,510
perform communication or message passing

1104
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:27,046
such that new expectations or

1105
01:02:27,068 --> 01:02:31,078
preferences are set whether more

1106
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,542
top down, like more seeing, like a state

1107
01:02:33,596 --> 01:02:35,926
or more laterally, more like collective

1108
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:39,002
behavior then those regimes can be

1109
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:41,450
embodied. And then you brought up a very

1110
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,786
important point about the awareness of

1111
01:02:43,808 --> 01:02:46,266
the contingencies or awarenesses of

1112
01:02:46,288 --> 01:02:47,626
adjacent possibles or of

1113
01:02:47,648 --> 01:02:51,294
counterfactuals. So the body

1114
01:02:51,412 --> 01:02:54,762
might be we could model its morphology

1115
01:02:54,826 --> 01:02:57,214
as doing some computation but that

1116
01:02:57,252 --> 01:02:59,806
doesn't mean that the morphology has an

1117
01:02:59,828 --> 01:03:01,346
awareness or can explore a

1118
01:03:01,368 --> 01:03:04,834
counterfactual. Like bodies are not

1119
01:03:04,872 --> 01:03:07,650
always exploring every counterfactual

1120
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:11,122
because Skin is in the game. But again,

1121
01:03:11,176 --> 01:03:14,934
mentally it's very cheap and easy to

1122
01:03:14,972 --> 01:03:18,306
consider counterfactuals and situational

1123
01:03:18,338 --> 01:03:20,626
awareness of social settings,

1124
01:03:20,818 --> 01:03:22,646
especially if it can be not just

1125
01:03:22,668 --> 01:03:26,266
understood but communicated, opens up a

1126
01:03:26,288 --> 01:03:28,086
space where we're all playing Prisoners

1127
01:03:28,118 --> 01:03:30,726
Dilemma. Now there's parameterizations

1128
01:03:30,758 --> 01:03:32,598
of Prisoners multi agent Prisoners

1129
01:03:32,614 --> 01:03:35,690
Dilemma where tragically, we just all

1130
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,386
defect all day and never learn. There's

1131
01:03:39,418 --> 01:03:41,262
also parameterizations where you just

1132
01:03:41,316 --> 01:03:44,350
start all cooperating and never defect.

1133
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,766
And then the interesting settings are

1134
01:03:46,788 --> 01:03:48,282
where there might be like phase

1135
01:03:48,346 --> 01:03:51,582
transitions or where a perturbation

1136
01:03:51,726 --> 01:03:54,930
moves the system from one attractor into

1137
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,146
another attractor. So there's just a lot

1138
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:02,114
of richness and that's the

1139
01:04:02,152 --> 01:04:04,398
work of building generative models and

1140
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:08,680
that iterated modeling process to

1141
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,870
unpack and refine.

1142
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:15,094
And active inference isn't going to have

1143
01:04:15,132 --> 01:04:17,866
a stance on a Prisoner's dilemma. We can

1144
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:20,218
use active inference to describe the

1145
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:21,974
prisoner's dilemma, but active inference

1146
01:04:22,022 --> 01:04:24,614
isn't going to come down on literally

1147
01:04:24,662 --> 01:04:26,294
even a little two by two game theory

1148
01:04:26,342 --> 01:04:29,386
matrix. So we can then extrapolate

1149
01:04:29,418 --> 01:04:30,846
that active inference is not going to

1150
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:34,190
come down with an opinion on something

1151
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:37,630
significantly more

1152
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:41,154
rich and real than a two by

1153
01:04:41,192 --> 01:04:45,060
two game theory matrix. And so that work

1154
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:51,042
is what people enact in

1155
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,770
applying active inference.

1156
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:00,014
Right? And I think my question is

1157
01:05:00,052 --> 01:05:04,218
something like but insofar as humans

1158
01:05:04,314 --> 01:05:08,078
try to constantly improve their social

1159
01:05:08,164 --> 01:05:11,614
games, how can we model

1160
01:05:11,732 --> 01:05:14,314
that sort of a prior over your actions

1161
01:05:14,362 --> 01:05:17,566
or policies that enables that

1162
01:05:17,588 --> 01:05:20,030
sort of progressive, um,

1163
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:24,120
improvements or something?

1164
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,040
Well,

1165
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:30,966
we are assuming that we're trying to

1166
01:05:30,988 --> 01:05:33,594
improve. We don't know that, but you can

1167
01:05:33,632 --> 01:05:37,418
model them as improving. But like

1168
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:40,634
following Daniel's lead, we're talking

1169
01:05:40,672 --> 01:05:42,794
about these specific games and

1170
01:05:42,832 --> 01:05:46,446
contingencies these transitions from one

1171
01:05:46,468 --> 01:05:49,086
state to another. Specifically, if

1172
01:05:49,108 --> 01:05:50,926
you're talking about this modeling of

1173
01:05:51,028 --> 01:05:54,474
social actors and talking about several

1174
01:05:54,602 --> 01:05:56,666
actors, if your model involves several

1175
01:05:56,698 --> 01:05:58,814
of them, will not be really linear,

1176
01:05:58,862 --> 01:06:00,660
right? You don't have like an easy,

1177
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:04,834
smooth transition of improvement you can

1178
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:09,922
capture over time as modeling how

1179
01:06:09,976 --> 01:06:12,886
they might tend to go towards a

1180
01:06:12,908 --> 01:06:15,174
direction and understand that as

1181
01:06:15,212 --> 01:06:20,358
improvement. But that takes specific

1182
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:22,686
iterations that will not be fully

1183
01:06:22,738 --> 01:06:25,258
linear. I guess specifically if you want

1184
01:06:25,264 --> 01:06:28,902
to understand Error and improvement

1185
01:06:29,046 --> 01:06:32,026
instead of Trier and Error but trier and

1186
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:36,154
adding up into this Error like Error

1187
01:06:36,202 --> 01:06:39,082
improvement. But when you're modeling

1188
01:06:39,146 --> 01:06:41,866
specifically with dynamical systems,

1189
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:44,126
for instance, you're not going to see a

1190
01:06:44,148 --> 01:06:46,366
full linear story and I don't think

1191
01:06:46,388 --> 01:06:49,338
you're going to see that if you're

1192
01:06:49,364 --> 01:06:52,050
modeling using active inference and

1193
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,300
multiple agents.

1194
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:58,914
I'll add one piece there. So how could

1195
01:06:58,952 --> 01:07:03,350
we go about modeling multiscale social

1196
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:07,366
goals so we could think

1197
01:07:07,388 --> 01:07:11,190
about different citizens in a region

1198
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:15,546
and the modeler is

1199
01:07:15,568 --> 01:07:18,700
going to choose what knowledge to

1200
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:22,300
realize in the generative model, like

1201
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:24,886
what you put into the calculator it's

1202
01:07:24,918 --> 01:07:27,182
going to calculate upon. Now this

1203
01:07:27,236 --> 01:07:31,710
happens to be an elaborate stochastic

1204
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:36,110
method, but if we only tell

1205
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,238
people, yeah, there's just your personal

1206
01:07:38,324 --> 01:07:40,706
income optimize for that, your

1207
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:42,322
preference is to have that be higher,

1208
01:07:42,456 --> 01:07:44,146
well, then the simulation is going to

1209
01:07:44,168 --> 01:07:46,914
unfold a certain way. If we say, well,

1210
01:07:46,952 --> 01:07:49,486
there's your personal financial income

1211
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,926
and then there's your city and then

1212
01:07:51,948 --> 01:07:55,506
there's your region, then that opens

1213
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:59,778
up through different mechanisms.

1214
01:07:59,954 --> 01:08:03,270
Maybe an individual goes flat or

1215
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:06,858
neutral on the personal in service of a

1216
01:08:06,864 --> 01:08:09,978
larger win at a higher level.

1217
01:08:10,144 --> 01:08:11,878
Well now what if the modeler says it's

1218
01:08:11,894 --> 01:08:13,706
not just about the financial income now

1219
01:08:13,728 --> 01:08:15,234
we're also going to have this secondary

1220
01:08:15,302 --> 01:08:18,080
criterion? Well now different agents

1221
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:20,574
could attend differently to those two

1222
01:08:20,612 --> 01:08:24,110
different outcome variables.

1223
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:27,626
And maybe there's one simulation where

1224
01:08:27,748 --> 01:08:29,826
50% only care about this and 50% care

1225
01:08:29,848 --> 01:08:32,018
about that and it works perfect or it

1226
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:32,900
doesn't work.

1227
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:39,362
It's like a broad surveying or

1228
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:42,790
Lego set or grammar

1229
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:46,840
or active inference ontology for

1230
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:51,254
scoping very broadly and very

1231
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:54,762
inclusively. But all

1232
01:08:54,816 --> 01:09:00,038
the work is in the real simulation

1233
01:09:00,214 --> 01:09:05,582
development and sweeping because

1234
01:09:05,636 --> 01:09:09,166
very little could be said about a

1235
01:09:09,188 --> 01:09:11,054
game theory game. If you didn't know

1236
01:09:11,092 --> 01:09:13,710
what the parameters were in the matrix,

1237
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,598
you wouldn't know whether this

1238
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,174
Prisoner's Dilemma was going to be like

1239
01:09:18,212 --> 01:09:20,386
an always cooperate or which agents with

1240
01:09:20,408 --> 01:09:21,566
which strategies would or wouldn't

1241
01:09:21,598 --> 01:09:23,458
cooperate if you don't know what the

1242
01:09:23,464 --> 01:09:27,554
matrix looks like. So before the

1243
01:09:27,592 --> 01:09:29,700
values have kind of been filled in,

1244
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:34,326
it's just like actually describing the

1245
01:09:34,348 --> 01:09:36,118
adjacencies and the counterfactuals and

1246
01:09:36,124 --> 01:09:37,922
the contingencies of our scientific

1247
01:09:37,986 --> 01:09:41,878
model. But that's still

1248
01:09:41,964 --> 01:09:45,000
prior to having the model in hand.

1249
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:49,318
So now we're looking at that tree in the

1250
01:09:49,324 --> 01:09:51,946
European forest and it's like, well, if

1251
01:09:51,968 --> 01:09:53,338
I had this tool, then I could cut it

1252
01:09:53,344 --> 01:09:54,698
down this way. If I had this tool, I

1253
01:09:54,704 --> 01:09:56,094
could cut it down this way or I could

1254
01:09:56,132 --> 01:09:58,910
wait. It's like that's.

1255
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:04,030
Alternative actions about that tree.

1256
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:06,430
Now in the social science setting,

1257
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:08,622
discussion of different scientific

1258
01:10:08,686 --> 01:10:11,614
methodologies are like counterfactuals

1259
01:10:11,662 --> 01:10:14,850
about that social tree.

1260
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:28,546
Yeah. And specifically, if you're

1261
01:10:28,578 --> 01:10:30,502
navigating these kinds of game

1262
01:10:30,556 --> 01:10:33,526
theoretical models, if that's what

1263
01:10:33,548 --> 01:10:36,360
you're interested in, you can even

1264
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:39,606
define in terms of prisoners dilemma,

1265
01:10:39,638 --> 01:10:43,590
for instance, specific values

1266
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:46,922
to see what happens when

1267
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:51,474
everybody deflects

1268
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:54,766
and how frequent modulate those

1269
01:10:54,788 --> 01:10:59,262
frequencies in terms of specific in

1270
01:10:59,316 --> 01:11:00,670
multiple iterations.

1271
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:05,862
How are you going to build up the weight

1272
01:11:06,026 --> 01:11:09,742
for the tendency of deflecting?

1273
01:11:09,806 --> 01:11:13,506
Again, if your neighbor deflected once

1274
01:11:13,608 --> 01:11:18,134
and deflected twice or three times and

1275
01:11:18,172 --> 01:11:22,342
see how that will accommodate over

1276
01:11:22,396 --> 01:11:25,062
time how many times this agent will

1277
01:11:25,116 --> 01:11:27,366
change its behavior until it stops

1278
01:11:27,398 --> 01:11:30,746
changing the behavior. But you

1279
01:11:30,768 --> 01:11:37,146
don't really again,

1280
01:11:37,328 --> 01:11:39,846
you might use a Bayesian understanding

1281
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:42,094
Bayesian model for that, but it not

1282
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:51,346
necessarily explain it

1283
01:11:51,368 --> 01:11:53,690
does not necessarily explain the action

1284
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:55,720
fully. I mean,

1285
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:59,606
socially you're modeling only the

1286
01:11:59,628 --> 01:12:01,830
interest of that specific actor.

1287
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:08,522
I have a slightly meta question, if I

1288
01:12:08,576 --> 01:12:11,626
can ask both of you. I'm not sure how

1289
01:12:11,648 --> 01:12:14,982
these calls usually go. I'm curious

1290
01:12:15,046 --> 01:12:17,366
what are your interests in active

1291
01:12:17,398 --> 01:12:20,266
inference? What brings you to active

1292
01:12:20,298 --> 01:12:23,418
inference and what do you think active

1293
01:12:23,434 --> 01:12:25,882
inference adds to our theoretical

1294
01:12:25,946 --> 01:12:27,358
understanding and in what ways or

1295
01:12:27,364 --> 01:12:27,920
something.

1296
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:32,260
Lorena, go for it.

1297
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:37,442
Well, I think I was

1298
01:12:37,496 --> 01:12:40,626
trying to touch upon that before and how

1299
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:43,986
we can, if you're navigating, for

1300
01:12:44,008 --> 01:12:45,542
instance, behavior in terms of game

1301
01:12:45,596 --> 01:12:48,098
theory, this kind of modeling, if you're

1302
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,766
talking about like trust games, for

1303
01:12:49,788 --> 01:12:52,294
instance, you're going to understand how

1304
01:12:52,332 --> 01:12:55,266
these two addict interactions evolve

1305
01:12:55,298 --> 01:12:56,842
over time, specifically over

1306
01:12:56,896 --> 01:13:00,026
interactions. But you don't have

1307
01:13:00,048 --> 01:13:03,146
an account of change because you have

1308
01:13:03,168 --> 01:13:08,554
very limited options of actions, and you

1309
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,726
don't have an account also on scales.

1310
01:13:10,758 --> 01:13:12,810
And I think active influence tries to

1311
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,846
edge a little bit an account on how you

1312
01:13:14,868 --> 01:13:23,154
can scale that and how

1313
01:13:23,192 --> 01:13:25,106
you can add more parameters into the

1314
01:13:25,128 --> 01:13:28,690
game and see how they evolve with

1315
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,814
a more clear understanding,

1316
01:13:32,862 --> 01:13:34,694
some richer understanding. That, for

1317
01:13:34,732 --> 01:13:36,150
instance, when you talk about specific

1318
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,830
interactions in game theory.

1319
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:43,510
So that's one

1320
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,734
aspect that active inference kind of

1321
01:13:45,772 --> 01:13:49,354
contributes. Another point is because

1322
01:13:49,552 --> 01:13:53,718
we have this parameterization

1323
01:13:53,814 --> 01:13:57,434
that is specifically in terms of

1324
01:13:57,472 --> 01:13:59,406
belief updating and also in terms of

1325
01:13:59,428 --> 01:14:02,526
dynamics, we are

1326
01:14:02,548 --> 01:14:05,774
always talking about agents that will be

1327
01:14:05,812 --> 01:14:08,942
situated and embodied and have a very

1328
01:14:08,996 --> 01:14:15,246
specific synchronization

1329
01:14:15,358 --> 01:14:17,042
with the environment all the time.

1330
01:14:17,096 --> 01:14:19,006
Because when you talk about active

1331
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:21,090
inference, the action comes always

1332
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,802
first. So you try to have a less

1333
01:14:24,856 --> 01:14:26,200
reductive model.

1334
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:31,234
And when you want to model cultural

1335
01:14:31,282 --> 01:14:33,974
agents and collective action, I think

1336
01:14:34,012 --> 01:14:35,846
that's kind of desirable. That's what

1337
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:39,482
you're looking for. Is it also your

1338
01:14:39,536 --> 01:14:42,714
area of interest? Sorry? Is it also

1339
01:14:42,752 --> 01:14:43,980
your area of interest.

1340
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:49,816
Mine or is that Lorena's area of

1341
01:14:49,838 --> 01:14:54,280
interest? Lorena's, what do you sorry.

1342
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:55,836
Like, my question was also like, what

1343
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:58,508
brings you to active inference? And I

1344
01:14:58,514 --> 01:14:59,932
think you answered a lot of ways in

1345
01:14:59,986 --> 01:15:02,504
which active inference adds theoretical

1346
01:15:02,552 --> 01:15:05,536
value, but I wasn't sure if that was

1347
01:15:05,558 --> 01:15:07,536
also your subjective interest or

1348
01:15:07,558 --> 01:15:09,728
motivation. It's my subjective interest.

1349
01:15:09,894 --> 01:15:12,556
Yeah. I'm curious to see how that pans

1350
01:15:12,588 --> 01:15:15,104
out. Right. I'm interested in how that

1351
01:15:15,142 --> 01:15:19,140
helps us to think of this

1352
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:23,620
type of phenomena,

1353
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,316
and I'm very interested in how this

1354
01:15:27,418 --> 01:15:29,732
relationship from agents to collectives

1355
01:15:29,796 --> 01:15:31,370
and back again work.

1356
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:39,928
And I think it might give us some well,

1357
01:15:40,014 --> 01:15:43,084
you give us some very insightful way of

1358
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:49,724
modeling these relationships and

1359
01:15:49,762 --> 01:15:52,750
navigating it as you want, because this

1360
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,376
feature of being scale free is kind of

1361
01:15:55,398 --> 01:15:58,448
helpful to looking things.

1362
01:15:58,614 --> 01:16:02,236
You can define your Markov

1363
01:16:02,268 --> 01:16:04,130
blanket in terms of are you interested

1364
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,010
and see what happens.

1365
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:14,594
I don't know. Yeah, I'll just give a few

1366
01:16:14,632 --> 01:16:16,626
thoughts, even though also, surely some

1367
01:16:16,648 --> 01:16:19,330
of these thoughts are scattered.

1368
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:23,378
You asked TJ, what does active inference

1369
01:16:23,554 --> 01:16:26,534
add to our theoretical account of the

1370
01:16:26,572 --> 01:16:30,294
social? It does many things, in my

1371
01:16:30,332 --> 01:16:32,454
view, and that's what makes it so

1372
01:16:32,572 --> 01:16:35,162
valuable epistemically and

1373
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:38,250
pragmatically. It gives us the

1374
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,654
expressivity within a scale

1375
01:16:41,702 --> 01:16:43,386
to describe collective behavior and

1376
01:16:43,408 --> 01:16:45,126
across scales to describe nested

1377
01:16:45,158 --> 01:16:49,278
systems. So that brings continuity to

1378
01:16:49,364 --> 01:16:51,946
discussions of the social with broader

1379
01:16:51,978 --> 01:16:54,058
discussions of the biological,

1380
01:16:54,154 --> 01:16:57,482
ecological, computational, physical,

1381
01:16:57,546 --> 01:17:00,526
and so on. So that's a multiscaled

1382
01:17:00,558 --> 01:17:03,006
transdisciplinary element. Active

1383
01:17:03,038 --> 01:17:05,810
inference provides us with legible first

1384
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,618
principles which can either be taken

1385
01:17:09,784 --> 01:17:14,694
instrumentally as just heuristics and

1386
01:17:14,732 --> 01:17:17,618
also in certain situations can be viewed

1387
01:17:17,714 --> 01:17:21,938
empirically as justifiable

1388
01:17:22,034 --> 01:17:24,722
first principles and then from those

1389
01:17:24,796 --> 01:17:26,794
legible first principles which are not.

1390
01:17:26,832 --> 01:17:30,138
English specific, they're already

1391
01:17:30,304 --> 01:17:33,706
in a space that has a

1392
01:17:33,728 --> 01:17:38,426
lot more possibility

1393
01:17:38,538 --> 01:17:41,758
and promise than, for example,

1394
01:17:41,844 --> 01:17:43,966
a mere enumeration of important

1395
01:17:44,068 --> 01:17:47,438
adjectives or nouns. We can

1396
01:17:47,524 --> 01:17:49,466
develop lists of important adjectives

1397
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,862
and nouns when we have a broader

1398
01:17:52,926 --> 01:17:56,562
cognitive modeling framework. And so

1399
01:17:56,696 --> 01:18:00,418
this methodological turn then

1400
01:18:00,504 --> 01:18:03,054
supports just a tremendous diversity of

1401
01:18:03,112 --> 01:18:06,902
thought and work. Instead of asking

1402
01:18:06,956 --> 01:18:08,598
us to kind of go through the eye of the

1403
01:18:08,604 --> 01:18:11,240
needle and get on board with this one

1404
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:14,986
ranking of features and then try to

1405
01:18:15,008 --> 01:18:17,226
apply it more broadly, that's like an

1406
01:18:17,248 --> 01:18:20,060
overfit before the Cart situation.

1407
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:23,546
With Actimf, we can expand the

1408
01:18:23,568 --> 01:18:26,714
methodological discussion, connect it to

1409
01:18:26,752 --> 01:18:28,606
theoretical physics and mathematics in

1410
01:18:28,628 --> 01:18:30,062
ways that really haven't been seen

1411
01:18:30,116 --> 01:18:33,294
before, and then that opens up

1412
01:18:33,332 --> 01:18:36,846
more than it closes down. It brings up

1413
01:18:36,868 --> 01:18:39,906
more questions than it resolves in and

1414
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:42,658
of itself, but it opens the questions

1415
01:18:42,744 --> 01:18:45,954
that can be resolved, like what

1416
01:18:45,992 --> 01:18:49,250
generative model can I make that will

1417
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,330
keep the temperature in this building

1418
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,906
livable? But active inference isn't

1419
01:18:53,938 --> 01:18:55,558
going to have a stance on what you

1420
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:59,286
should do for that building. So we need

1421
01:18:59,308 --> 01:19:01,798
to, in a way, take a step in the

1422
01:19:01,804 --> 01:19:03,670
methodological direction,

1423
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:06,726
which I see as moving towards active

1424
01:19:06,758 --> 01:19:11,046
inference to enable a million steps

1425
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:12,810
in different directions.

1426
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:19,360
I have a bunch of questions here.

1427
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:23,962
I think one is probably just a reference

1428
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:26,558
question. There are three topics that

1429
01:19:26,564 --> 01:19:28,846
I'll say. If you guys have any papers or

1430
01:19:28,868 --> 01:19:31,042
articles on those things, I would love

1431
01:19:31,096 --> 01:19:34,420
to get a reference. One is,

1432
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:38,142
in what ways can we model a collection

1433
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,966
or an aggregation of active inference

1434
01:19:39,998 --> 01:19:44,280
agents as a super agent?

1435
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:47,446
Active inference, super agent or

1436
01:19:47,468 --> 01:19:49,830
something? And how does this

1437
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,750
decomposition and aggregation

1438
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:55,582
flexibility work in different contexts?

1439
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:59,290
If there's work that tries to either

1440
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,646
make informal commentary or formal

1441
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:05,210
modeling either ways, I would love to

1442
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,890
see that. Secondly.

1443
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:11,214
Just on the first, check out the

1444
01:20:11,252 --> 01:20:14,222
previous section of this course on

1445
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:16,522
collective behavior, where I reviewed

1446
01:20:16,586 --> 01:20:19,760
many such works. Great, thanks. Okay,

1447
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:22,846
is it on the same notion? Is it linked

1448
01:20:22,878 --> 01:20:24,866
from the same notion. Thing all in the

1449
01:20:24,888 --> 01:20:27,134
same places and in the same playlist

1450
01:20:27,182 --> 01:20:29,538
with this course? Same syllabus? Yes.

1451
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:33,506
Got it. Okay. The second is, is there an

1452
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:36,440
active entrance account of,

1453
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:40,770
say, markets or economic interaction

1454
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:44,294
wherein your prices act as some

1455
01:20:44,332 --> 01:20:48,006
sorts of information signals? And can

1456
01:20:48,028 --> 01:20:49,674
you use active inference to then talk

1457
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:53,386
about aggregation of market entities or

1458
01:20:53,408 --> 01:20:55,754
something? I'm guessing this would also

1459
01:20:55,792 --> 01:20:58,266
be covered in the same list. Indeed,

1460
01:20:58,378 --> 01:21:00,122
people have explored cognitive

1461
01:21:00,186 --> 01:21:02,862
economics, and people are working on it,

1462
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:05,294
but that doesn't mean it's a done deal

1463
01:21:05,412 --> 01:21:08,138
theoretically or especially in practice.

1464
01:21:08,314 --> 01:21:12,106
So keep going. It's quite experimental

1465
01:21:12,138 --> 01:21:13,454
still, but there are a bunch of people

1466
01:21:13,492 --> 01:21:16,266
working on that, I guess. I don't

1467
01:21:16,298 --> 01:21:18,222
remember any specific paper right now,

1468
01:21:18,276 --> 01:21:22,790
but I can look it up and forward

1469
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:25,990
to you. But yeah, it would be great.

1470
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:28,630
I can drop my email address here. Yeah,

1471
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:32,006
sure. The third is probably more

1472
01:21:32,028 --> 01:21:34,230
trickier than both of these, which is,

1473
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:36,394
is there an active inference account of

1474
01:21:36,432 --> 01:21:37,770
natural language?

1475
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:43,574
Yes. Thankfully, colleagues like Elliot

1476
01:21:43,622 --> 01:21:47,698
Murphy and others have explored

1477
01:21:47,894 --> 01:21:51,280
specifically the linguistic aspects of

1478
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:56,810
natural speech. I think Lorena's lecture

1479
01:21:56,890 --> 01:22:00,226
and area of focus generalizes a

1480
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:04,558
bit beyond specific natural language,

1481
01:22:04,654 --> 01:22:06,574
because we're talking about semiotics

1482
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:09,742
and semantics in a more intermodal

1483
01:22:09,806 --> 01:22:12,126
sense. However, yes, there's been

1484
01:22:12,168 --> 01:22:14,962
limited work from a computational

1485
01:22:15,026 --> 01:22:17,602
linguistics and neurobiology perspective

1486
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:18,710
on speech.

1487
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:28,934
Okay, so then okay,

1488
01:22:28,972 --> 01:22:30,502
so you said something like first

1489
01:22:30,556 --> 01:22:33,078
principles stuff. When you're making a

1490
01:22:33,084 --> 01:22:34,546
commentary on what active inference

1491
01:22:34,578 --> 01:22:38,486
brings, I'm still often

1492
01:22:38,588 --> 01:22:40,166
struggling, what is active inference

1493
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:42,374
offering? And I try to encounter

1494
01:22:42,422 --> 01:22:45,178
different things. I think I enjoy a lot

1495
01:22:45,184 --> 01:22:47,242
of philosophical questions that the

1496
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:49,450
conversation opens up, but I'm still

1497
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,894
very ambivalent about the theory. And

1498
01:22:52,932 --> 01:22:56,554
when I read this new book, which Friston

1499
01:22:56,602 --> 01:22:59,914
has not written but is a co author,

1500
01:22:59,962 --> 01:23:02,640
I don't remember the name of the book.

1501
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:07,438
Yeah, I don't exactly remember. There's

1502
01:23:07,454 --> 01:23:09,918
a book, right, which is supposedly

1503
01:23:10,094 --> 01:23:13,026
supposed to be the canon, and Friston is

1504
01:23:13,048 --> 01:23:14,626
a co author, but in the. Preface, he

1505
01:23:14,648 --> 01:23:18,694
says, so that's the 2022

1506
01:23:18,812 --> 01:23:22,182
Par Friston Pazula textbook, right?

1507
01:23:22,236 --> 01:23:25,574
Par, yeah. I wouldn't quite

1508
01:23:25,612 --> 01:23:27,318
say it's the canon, since it's a short

1509
01:23:27,404 --> 01:23:31,378
book, but certainly it is a landmark

1510
01:23:31,474 --> 01:23:34,826
moment for the field. Right. And when I

1511
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:38,086
read that, the one thing that bothered

1512
01:23:38,118 --> 01:23:41,706
me was it brings

1513
01:23:41,738 --> 01:23:44,560
up the helmet's free energy thing,

1514
01:23:45,410 --> 01:23:48,830
but it sort of argues it by fiat. Like,

1515
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:51,326
okay, this is a simple principle. It can

1516
01:23:51,348 --> 01:23:54,046
model a lot of things, but that doesn't

1517
01:23:54,078 --> 01:23:57,186
tell me why I

1518
01:23:57,208 --> 01:24:00,594
should trust it. What is the reason to

1519
01:24:00,632 --> 01:24:03,586
act? Why does this principle lead to

1520
01:24:03,608 --> 01:24:06,530
cognition? Sure,

1521
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,914
you've posited a very simple principle

1522
01:24:08,962 --> 01:24:10,774
and then said, hey, look, this simple

1523
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:12,374
principle can explain so many things,

1524
01:24:12,412 --> 01:24:15,654
but well, it also explained things that

1525
01:24:15,692 --> 01:24:18,970
don't look like cognition, and I'm not

1526
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,186
sure I got an

1527
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:27,658
account of why that principle is works

1528
01:24:27,744 --> 01:24:31,150
or something. Lorena, go for it.

1529
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:33,150
I'll think of some other ways to say it.

1530
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:36,426
Yeah, you can think of modeling

1531
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:38,702
by construction and modeling by first

1532
01:24:38,756 --> 01:24:41,534
principles, and modeling by first

1533
01:24:41,572 --> 01:24:45,074
principles. You have some limitations in

1534
01:24:45,112 --> 01:24:48,594
which you cannot fully explain some

1535
01:24:48,632 --> 01:24:52,306
things. But the virtue of the

1536
01:24:52,328 --> 01:24:54,462
model and how the first principle

1537
01:24:54,526 --> 01:24:56,582
organizes everything that comes along

1538
01:24:56,636 --> 01:24:58,662
with the model usually might be

1539
01:24:58,716 --> 01:25:02,194
sufficient or might be a useful

1540
01:25:02,242 --> 01:25:05,202
tool to help you explain that phenomena

1541
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,606
that based on the first principle that

1542
01:25:07,628 --> 01:25:11,610
you were bringing along. And that's

1543
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:14,394
one part of answering this question. I

1544
01:25:14,432 --> 01:25:18,026
think it might be a big question for the

1545
01:25:18,048 --> 01:25:22,846
field. Yeah, here's some short little

1546
01:25:23,028 --> 01:25:27,230
threads on that. Yeah. We can describe

1547
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:30,894
maladaptive cognitive systems or

1548
01:25:30,932 --> 01:25:32,494
adaptive cognitive systems, whether

1549
01:25:32,532 --> 01:25:34,706
something's adaptive or not is always in

1550
01:25:34,728 --> 01:25:37,106
relationship to its niche, like the

1551
01:25:37,128 --> 01:25:38,738
foraging algorithm that works in the

1552
01:25:38,744 --> 01:25:40,658
desert doesn't necessarily work in the

1553
01:25:40,664 --> 01:25:43,506
rainforest. So these systems are not

1554
01:25:43,528 --> 01:25:46,542
like intrinsically adaptive or not.

1555
01:25:46,696 --> 01:25:48,694
We want to have natural language that

1556
01:25:48,732 --> 01:25:51,686
allows sentences that are valid and

1557
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:54,166
invalid and have different kinds of

1558
01:25:54,188 --> 01:25:55,446
semantics. So again, this is just an

1559
01:25:55,468 --> 01:25:58,686
expressivity framework that enables

1560
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:02,154
people to build cognitive models of high

1561
01:26:02,192 --> 01:26:05,242
reliability or important settings. Or

1562
01:26:05,376 --> 01:26:06,986
you could make something that looks just

1563
01:26:07,008 --> 01:26:09,994
like a beautiful circuit board and not

1564
01:26:10,032 --> 01:26:12,302
even worry about what the outcome is.

1565
01:26:12,436 --> 01:26:14,366
Yeah, for sure you can describe all

1566
01:26:14,388 --> 01:26:16,960
kinds of systems. That would be like

1567
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:21,162
having a less than functional

1568
01:26:21,226 --> 01:26:22,766
methodological system. If we said,

1569
01:26:22,788 --> 01:26:24,106
well, we're doing a linear regression

1570
01:26:24,138 --> 01:26:25,594
framework but we only want positive

1571
01:26:25,642 --> 01:26:27,666
regressions, it's like, well, no, at the

1572
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:29,186
methodological level, we want it to be

1573
01:26:29,208 --> 01:26:31,746
able to do any slope. So here in the

1574
01:26:31,768 --> 01:26:34,450
cognitive modeling setting, we want more

1575
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,422
expressivity so that we can actually

1576
01:26:36,476 --> 01:26:37,830
construct the ones that we're interested

1577
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:42,134
in. And then how does this really

1578
01:26:42,252 --> 01:26:45,702
do cognition? How is it that a first

1579
01:26:45,756 --> 01:26:49,398
principles like surprise minimization

1580
01:26:49,574 --> 01:26:51,562
or the bounding of surprise through free

1581
01:26:51,616 --> 01:26:55,562
energy, how can that really cover so

1582
01:26:55,616 --> 01:26:58,090
many cognitive phenomena?

1583
01:26:58,990 --> 01:27:01,790
That's the question and the play. But

1584
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:04,730
how is it that Newton's laws of motion

1585
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:07,934
can describe so many objects being

1586
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:12,142
dropped off a tower? How is it that

1587
01:27:12,196 --> 01:27:15,474
Bayesian mechanics can describe so

1588
01:27:15,512 --> 01:27:18,210
many different priors being updated?

1589
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:22,398
And so by understanding cognitive paths

1590
01:27:22,494 --> 01:27:25,186
as paths of least action, which is the

1591
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:28,754
free energy principle, a wide variety

1592
01:27:28,802 --> 01:27:32,600
of models become

1593
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:38,822
of a similar kind, now become

1594
01:27:38,876 --> 01:27:42,882
available. Yeah, whether that's useful

1595
01:27:42,946 --> 01:27:45,334
to a given person in a given setting.

1596
01:27:45,382 --> 01:27:46,646
Like if you make an active inference

1597
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:48,186
model of your business, it doesn't mean

1598
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:49,786
you're going to succeed. If you make a

1599
01:27:49,808 --> 01:27:51,386
self driving car with active inference,

1600
01:27:51,418 --> 01:27:53,200
it doesn't mean it's going to work.

1601
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:57,614
This isn't a guarantee of success, but

1602
01:27:57,652 --> 01:28:00,654
it's a method that can be utilized. And

1603
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:03,062
we know that the method reaches

1604
01:28:03,226 --> 01:28:06,610
different kinds of modeling outcomes and

1605
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:09,506
supports subsequent perspectives and

1606
01:28:09,528 --> 01:28:12,946
models from where it reaches. But we

1607
01:28:12,968 --> 01:28:15,374
can't a priori limit where the method

1608
01:28:15,422 --> 01:28:18,694
reaches to only the successful ones or

1609
01:28:18,732 --> 01:28:21,558
only biological systems. Then we

1610
01:28:21,564 --> 01:28:23,286
wouldn't even have the expressivity to

1611
01:28:23,308 --> 01:28:25,318
talk about cognitive ecosystems with

1612
01:28:25,404 --> 01:28:26,790
synthetic intelligences.

1613
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:31,382
And when you're talking about cognition

1614
01:28:31,446 --> 01:28:34,122
also we can use these kind of first

1615
01:28:34,176 --> 01:28:36,906
principles to model aspects of

1616
01:28:36,928 --> 01:28:39,158
cognition. But you might not necessarily

1617
01:28:39,254 --> 01:28:41,302
think that cognition is all encompassing

1618
01:28:41,366 --> 01:28:44,254
like that everywhere all the same, but

1619
01:28:44,292 --> 01:28:46,238
you can use that to model specific

1620
01:28:46,324 --> 01:28:48,494
things that you're interested in in

1621
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:51,034
cognitive behavior, like adaptivity.

1622
01:28:51,162 --> 01:28:52,974
Does it give me any insight to

1623
01:28:53,012 --> 01:28:55,374
understand what is adaptive behavior,

1624
01:28:55,422 --> 01:28:58,782
for instance? And which kind of insights

1625
01:28:58,846 --> 01:29:01,074
do I get? Are they interesting? Are they

1626
01:29:01,112 --> 01:29:04,958
useful? So that's what the availability

1627
01:29:05,134 --> 01:29:07,960
that this kind of model bring along. So

1628
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:10,422
you don't have to believe in the whole

1629
01:29:10,476 --> 01:29:12,246
story, but it gives you a lot of

1630
01:29:12,268 --> 01:29:15,974
leverage to ask questions and what

1631
01:29:16,012 --> 01:29:17,880
kind of questions you'll be asking.

1632
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:25,378
Okay, so let's say that active inference

1633
01:29:25,394 --> 01:29:27,302
and free energy allows me to talk about

1634
01:29:27,356 --> 01:29:31,670
systems, but does

1635
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:35,274
it also give me vocabulary to

1636
01:29:35,312 --> 01:29:38,426
then classify those systems in terms of,

1637
01:29:38,448 --> 01:29:40,460
let's say adaptivity would be one

1638
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:42,794
property, but there could be other

1639
01:29:42,832 --> 01:29:47,950
properties in terms of how

1640
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:50,814
rich the world model is or stuff like

1641
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:54,926
that. If you have a

1642
01:29:54,948 --> 01:29:57,806
portfolio of generative models, you

1643
01:29:57,828 --> 01:30:00,462
could summarize them according to the TJ

1644
01:30:00,526 --> 01:30:02,674
statistic, you could summarize them

1645
01:30:02,712 --> 01:30:04,706
according to the number of nodes, you

1646
01:30:04,728 --> 01:30:06,910
could put them into a common environment

1647
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:08,686
or different environments and summarize

1648
01:30:08,718 --> 01:30:11,320
their activity in any number of ways.

1649
01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:15,350
But we can't talk about

1650
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,766
a ranking or a summarization of a

1651
01:30:17,788 --> 01:30:19,298
portfolio of generative models that's

1652
01:30:19,314 --> 01:30:21,718
not in hand. This is a framework that

1653
01:30:21,724 --> 01:30:23,622
lets us build those diverse generative

1654
01:30:23,686 --> 01:30:27,034
models and then in a very open ended way

1655
01:30:27,072 --> 01:30:29,862
do model comparison, model selection,

1656
01:30:29,926 --> 01:30:33,430
model adequacy, all the kinds of complex

1657
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:38,222
systems engineering methods that

1658
01:30:38,356 --> 01:30:42,142
we want. And also

1659
01:30:42,196 --> 01:30:46,254
I would ask you, where do you see

1660
01:30:46,292 --> 01:30:49,842
a peer or a comparison first

1661
01:30:49,896 --> 01:30:53,582
principle? Active inference has legible

1662
01:30:53,646 --> 01:30:55,938
first principles which are reflected in

1663
01:30:55,944 --> 01:30:57,714
the active inference ontology and

1664
01:30:57,752 --> 01:30:59,666
expressions using it, which can be

1665
01:30:59,688 --> 01:31:01,286
represented in natural language. So

1666
01:31:01,308 --> 01:31:03,458
that's the talking about it, but it's

1667
01:31:03,474 --> 01:31:05,026
not only represented in natural

1668
01:31:05,058 --> 01:31:08,182
language, other frameworks have other

1669
01:31:08,236 --> 01:31:09,926
first principles that may or may not be

1670
01:31:09,948 --> 01:31:14,070
legible and people may choose different

1671
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,646
paths to go down for whichever number of

1672
01:31:16,668 --> 01:31:19,826
reasons. Well, you can compare them,

1673
01:31:19,868 --> 01:31:21,814
right models like they have the virtue,

1674
01:31:21,862 --> 01:31:23,980
you can compare them and see which one

1675
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:26,746
gives you the best insight that you're

1676
01:31:26,778 --> 01:31:31,390
looking for. Yeah, I think something

1677
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:34,682
that I could compare to active inference

1678
01:31:34,746 --> 01:31:36,362
is like say the Bayesian utility

1679
01:31:36,426 --> 01:31:39,906
maximization thing which has a different

1680
01:31:40,008 --> 01:31:43,060
ontology. I'm not a fan of that either.

1681
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:47,022
I'll just note that Bayesian utility

1682
01:31:47,086 --> 01:31:50,062
maximization is a special case of free

1683
01:31:50,136 --> 01:31:53,080
energy where there's no Epistemic value,

1684
01:31:53,690 --> 01:31:56,022
all you have is Pragmatic value and so

1685
01:31:56,076 --> 01:31:59,574
a. Special diminished not

1686
01:31:59,612 --> 01:32:01,046
necessarily. You have value of

1687
01:32:01,068 --> 01:32:03,074
information and you have explore exploit

1688
01:32:03,122 --> 01:32:05,382
trade offs in Beijing utility

1689
01:32:05,446 --> 01:32:06,860
maximization as well.

1690
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:11,866
If you load into your utility function,

1691
01:32:12,048 --> 01:32:14,534
if you can beg the question and load

1692
01:32:14,582 --> 01:32:17,566
Epistem into Pragma, you're right, then

1693
01:32:17,588 --> 01:32:19,786
all you need is Pragma. But in expected

1694
01:32:19,818 --> 01:32:22,094
free energy we have Epistemic and

1695
01:32:22,132 --> 01:32:24,906
Pragmatic value, which is what enables

1696
01:32:24,938 --> 01:32:27,418
us this expressivity. But I think we're

1697
01:32:27,434 --> 01:32:28,500
aligned on that.

1698
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:33,714
Right? I think I'm somewhat also

1699
01:32:33,832 --> 01:32:35,218
slightly confused because in the

1700
01:32:35,224 --> 01:32:37,630
Bayesian utility between the languages,

1701
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:40,018
comparing the languages as such in the

1702
01:32:40,024 --> 01:32:43,030
Bayesian utility maximization, the

1703
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:46,210
exploration parts that are prioritized

1704
01:32:46,290 --> 01:32:51,602
based on your X anti estimation

1705
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:56,406
on the value of information. Whereas I'm

1706
01:32:56,438 --> 01:32:59,526
not sure that holds true for the active

1707
01:32:59,558 --> 01:33:02,554
inference model as well, that the

1708
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:06,734
Epistemic exploration is prioritized or

1709
01:33:06,772 --> 01:33:10,894
valued in terms of some of the same

1710
01:33:11,012 --> 01:33:13,040
Pragmatic thing as well.

1711
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:19,850
You'll have a lot to explore

1712
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:23,074
and learn. You can make a model that is

1713
01:33:23,112 --> 01:33:25,794
80 20 or 2080 or 100 and zero between

1714
01:33:25,832 --> 01:33:28,114
Epistemic and Pragmatic. There's nothing

1715
01:33:28,152 --> 01:33:30,674
we. Can say across generative models

1716
01:33:30,722 --> 01:33:31,954
about whether active inference

1717
01:33:32,002 --> 01:33:35,254
prioritizes epistem or not because you

1718
01:33:35,292 --> 01:33:39,080
can make a model that's 100% or zero.

1719
01:33:39,770 --> 01:33:42,866
Sorry, I meant more like does active

1720
01:33:42,898 --> 01:33:45,346
inference allow us to talk about systems

1721
01:33:45,378 --> 01:33:47,078
that the Beijing utility maximization

1722
01:33:47,174 --> 01:33:49,638
doesn't allow us to talk about? I'm

1723
01:33:49,654 --> 01:33:51,334
talking particularly about expressive

1724
01:33:51,382 --> 01:33:55,802
power of the language. Are there

1725
01:33:55,936 --> 01:33:57,162
things that the Bayesian utility

1726
01:33:57,226 --> 01:33:58,906
maximization can talk about that active

1727
01:33:58,938 --> 01:34:00,126
inference cannot? Other things that

1728
01:34:00,148 --> 01:34:01,358
active inference can talk about that

1729
01:34:01,364 --> 01:34:03,066
Bayesian utility maximization cannot?

1730
01:34:03,178 --> 01:34:05,440
Two short answers. One short answer.

1731
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:09,758
Utility maximization must cram

1732
01:34:09,854 --> 01:34:12,660
epistemic value into Pragmatic value.

1733
01:34:13,430 --> 01:34:15,634
We gain more expressivity when we can

1734
01:34:15,672 --> 01:34:17,906
articulate out Pragmatic value, which is

1735
01:34:17,928 --> 01:34:19,314
the alignment of preferences with

1736
01:34:19,352 --> 01:34:21,374
observations from epistemic value,

1737
01:34:21,432 --> 01:34:23,526
which is information gain. So that's a

1738
01:34:23,548 --> 01:34:25,446
huge articulation. And the second thing

1739
01:34:25,468 --> 01:34:27,734
is when you're in an anything

1740
01:34:27,852 --> 01:34:30,598
maximization framework, when you're in a

1741
01:34:30,604 --> 01:34:32,646
utility function now, again, begging the

1742
01:34:32,668 --> 01:34:33,994
question how you constructed this

1743
01:34:34,032 --> 01:34:35,654
function that you're trying to maximize.

1744
01:34:35,782 --> 01:34:36,982
But when you're in a maximization

1745
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:40,426
framework, we have a well known set of

1746
01:34:40,448 --> 01:34:43,606
approaches for finding local and global

1747
01:34:43,718 --> 01:34:46,254
maxima using optimization or

1748
01:34:46,292 --> 01:34:49,626
maximization frameworks. What active

1749
01:34:49,658 --> 01:34:52,286
inference uniquely provides is it

1750
01:34:52,308 --> 01:34:54,682
describes the path that that cognitive

1751
01:34:54,746 --> 01:34:58,398
thing takes as a path of least

1752
01:34:58,484 --> 01:35:01,898
action that minimizes surprise.

1753
01:35:02,074 --> 01:35:04,018
So instead of climbing to the top of the

1754
01:35:04,024 --> 01:35:06,066
hill up, are we on a foothill or are we

1755
01:35:06,088 --> 01:35:08,494
on the biggest hill? We're like a ball

1756
01:35:08,542 --> 01:35:10,186
rolling to the bottom of the hill,

1757
01:35:10,318 --> 01:35:13,046
finding the least surprising path. Now,

1758
01:35:13,068 --> 01:35:14,950
that least surprising path can still

1759
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:17,670
include novelty and information gain,

1760
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:20,294
but it turns out to be a lot more

1761
01:35:20,332 --> 01:35:22,754
tractable and connected with statistical

1762
01:35:22,802 --> 01:35:24,986
physics and quantum mechanics. When we

1763
01:35:25,008 --> 01:35:26,838
talk about the path of least action,

1764
01:35:26,934 --> 01:35:29,658
ball rolling down the hill rather than

1765
01:35:29,744 --> 01:35:32,058
this sort of question beg on top of a

1766
01:35:32,064 --> 01:35:34,214
mountain climbing adventure Bayesian

1767
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:35,610
utility approach.

1768
01:35:38,830 --> 01:35:40,798
But it's up to each person to feel how

1769
01:35:40,804 --> 01:35:43,998
they want to feel. Yeah, and I

1770
01:35:44,004 --> 01:35:45,918
think that a little bit what's in the

1771
01:35:45,924 --> 01:35:47,786
book as well, when you take the low and

1772
01:35:47,828 --> 01:35:50,222
high road for free energy principle,

1773
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:53,522
right? Because how much you

1774
01:35:53,576 --> 01:35:57,310
want to have your utility

1775
01:35:57,390 --> 01:36:02,462
maximization function being disconnected

1776
01:36:02,526 --> 01:36:05,270
to the pragma, to the action.

1777
01:36:07,210 --> 01:36:08,898
Because when you're modeling behavior,

1778
01:36:08,994 --> 01:36:10,566
it will be hard to do that

1779
01:36:10,668 --> 01:36:13,010
independently. Like, you have a lot of

1780
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,826
you have way more assumptions. You are

1781
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:17,946
committing to much a greater level of

1782
01:36:17,968 --> 01:36:21,194
assumptions for your utility function if

1783
01:36:21,232 --> 01:36:22,460
you don't do that.

1784
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:28,702
Because with the action first, that

1785
01:36:28,756 --> 01:36:31,902
Pragmatizes, you have

1786
01:36:31,956 --> 01:36:33,886
reasons to describe, have reasons to

1787
01:36:33,908 --> 01:36:35,934
believe why that information gain works

1788
01:36:35,972 --> 01:36:39,902
the way that it does, you can leverage

1789
01:36:39,966 --> 01:36:42,740
some explanations on that. Without it,

1790
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:45,874
you have a model that has more

1791
01:36:45,912 --> 01:36:48,098
assumptions. And I think if you have a

1792
01:36:48,104 --> 01:36:50,100
model with less assumptions, it's always

1793
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:53,160
healthier, let's say so,

1794
01:36:55,130 --> 01:36:58,326
yeah. So I think that does talk about

1795
01:36:58,348 --> 01:37:01,334
the comparative analysis of the

1796
01:37:01,372 --> 01:37:04,038
expressivity. But I would also say as a

1797
01:37:04,044 --> 01:37:06,842
metaphor that I'm not happy with either

1798
01:37:06,896 --> 01:37:10,822
of those languages. I suspect

1799
01:37:10,886 --> 01:37:12,822
that both of those languages claim

1800
01:37:12,886 --> 01:37:16,010
certain ontological assumptions. And I'm

1801
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:17,886
always suspicious and wait, but where

1802
01:37:17,908 --> 01:37:19,822
are these ontological assumptions coming

1803
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:22,878
from? A few other points.

1804
01:37:23,044 --> 01:37:28,286
We tap into an absolutely meaningful

1805
01:37:28,398 --> 01:37:31,682
nexus of statistical methods and message

1806
01:37:31,736 --> 01:37:34,366
passing schemes with active inference.

1807
01:37:34,398 --> 01:37:36,078
If you can state something in the active

1808
01:37:36,094 --> 01:37:38,386
inference ontology and construct a

1809
01:37:38,408 --> 01:37:42,230
generative model then message

1810
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:43,986
passing algorithms can be deployed.

1811
01:37:44,018 --> 01:37:46,102
That contractably compute that model.

1812
01:37:46,156 --> 01:37:48,130
So that's absolutely nontrivial.

1813
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:50,454
Otherwise it's possible just to get

1814
01:37:50,492 --> 01:37:52,790
wrapped up in some analytical formalism.

1815
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:55,706
But then once you want to do that on a

1816
01:37:55,728 --> 01:37:59,082
4K video now you're on square zero

1817
01:37:59,136 --> 01:38:00,714
with the computer engineering. This is

1818
01:38:00,752 --> 01:38:03,866
not that way. And then I will respond to

1819
01:38:03,888 --> 01:38:06,174
your metapoint with a metapoint, which

1820
01:38:06,212 --> 01:38:08,654
is when we've enumerated the

1821
01:38:08,692 --> 01:38:11,886
alternatives, the one that we like best.

1822
01:38:12,068 --> 01:38:14,382
Personally, I feel happy with. I'm also

1823
01:38:14,436 --> 01:38:16,462
open to new alternatives arising. But

1824
01:38:16,516 --> 01:38:20,334
being unhappy when all things considered

1825
01:38:20,382 --> 01:38:23,380
is in play, why?

1826
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:28,162
What bothers you specifically on the

1827
01:38:28,216 --> 01:38:32,786
ontology of the

1828
01:38:32,808 --> 01:38:36,200
active imprint? Yeah,

1829
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:40,440
I think I'm still looking for

1830
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:43,626
I don't know what exactly I'm looking

1831
01:38:43,648 --> 01:38:45,546
for, but I feel dissatisfied with the

1832
01:38:45,568 --> 01:38:47,562
account given for why helmet's free

1833
01:38:47,616 --> 01:38:50,780
energy, least action thing like,

1834
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:55,100
is the central thing here or something.

1835
01:38:56,290 --> 01:38:57,966
Why does it work? Why does this

1836
01:38:57,988 --> 01:39:00,640
principle? Yeah.

1837
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:05,358
There'S a lot of funny answers I could

1838
01:39:05,444 --> 01:39:08,990
give there. Yeah, that delta,

1839
01:39:09,070 --> 01:39:13,582
that discrepancy, that's curiosity

1840
01:39:13,646 --> 01:39:15,506
and that's the space of the open and

1841
01:39:15,528 --> 01:39:17,454
that's learning and that's your unique

1842
01:39:17,502 --> 01:39:20,106
contribution to make and that's

1843
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:23,714
everything. So that's not just a thorn

1844
01:39:23,762 --> 01:39:27,862
in your shoe. That's like our

1845
01:39:27,916 --> 01:39:30,630
experience of action amidst uncertainty,

1846
01:39:31,690 --> 01:39:34,060
which is the water we're in.

1847
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:37,962
And so whether we take a higher

1848
01:39:38,016 --> 01:39:40,282
order narrative perspective on that

1849
01:39:40,336 --> 01:39:43,514
discrepancy being dissatisfying or that

1850
01:39:43,552 --> 01:39:46,266
discrepancy being satisfying, I think

1851
01:39:46,288 --> 01:39:48,014
it's pretty I just need to. Minimize my

1852
01:39:48,052 --> 01:39:50,414
surprise there. Yeah, and you can choose

1853
01:39:50,452 --> 01:39:52,254
to minimize your surprise through your

1854
01:39:52,292 --> 01:39:54,714
attention. You can choose to minimize

1855
01:39:54,762 --> 01:39:57,822
surprise at a higher narrative order.

1856
01:39:57,956 --> 01:40:01,442
Like, I am satisfied and complacent that

1857
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:03,522
I don't understand number theory but I

1858
01:40:03,576 --> 01:40:06,274
use numbers to count objects around me.

1859
01:40:06,472 --> 01:40:08,334
So that discrepancy and understanding

1860
01:40:08,382 --> 01:40:09,906
knowing that there's 1000 years of

1861
01:40:09,928 --> 01:40:12,420
research that could be done on numbers,

1862
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:16,214
it doesn't unsettle me. But for someone

1863
01:40:16,252 --> 01:40:18,854
else that might be unsettling and that

1864
01:40:18,892 --> 01:40:20,646
might lead them to ruminate. It also

1865
01:40:20,668 --> 01:40:22,294
might lead them to do a PhD in number

1866
01:40:22,332 --> 01:40:24,762
theory. So just different paths for

1867
01:40:24,816 --> 01:40:27,690
different individuals and contexts.

1868
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:30,234
But there's always so many technical and

1869
01:40:30,272 --> 01:40:31,930
meta levels with active.

1870
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:38,190
So I don't want to keep you guys over

1871
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:42,234
time, but I would ask one last reference

1872
01:40:42,282 --> 01:40:45,226
based thing, which is are there active

1873
01:40:45,258 --> 01:40:47,278
inference accounts of seeing like, a

1874
01:40:47,284 --> 01:40:50,926
state phenomena in any literature?

1875
01:40:51,118 --> 01:40:53,314
I think I heard you mention it once, so

1876
01:40:53,352 --> 01:40:55,060
I was like, yeah, look at this.

1877
01:40:56,630 --> 01:41:00,514
Yeah. Check out live stream 33 series.

1878
01:41:00,562 --> 01:41:03,474
But also this course that we're

1879
01:41:03,602 --> 01:41:08,230
literally actually enacting in with Avel

1880
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:12,534
is where these accounts come to

1881
01:41:12,572 --> 01:41:15,770
roost and where we're creating a space

1882
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,054
to develop it. And it's not a cathedral

1883
01:41:18,102 --> 01:41:21,386
for us just to spectate at today, but if

1884
01:41:21,408 --> 01:41:22,854
you want to make an active inference

1885
01:41:22,902 --> 01:41:25,422
generative model of whatever social

1886
01:41:25,476 --> 01:41:27,646
setting, when you have the model in

1887
01:41:27,668 --> 01:41:31,680
hand, a lot of your questions will be

1888
01:41:32,450 --> 01:41:33,710
sidestepped.

1889
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:38,354
Okay, where is the 33 thing that you

1890
01:41:38,392 --> 01:41:41,186
mentioned? If you go to the page with

1891
01:41:41,208 --> 01:41:44,706
all of our Institute live streams and

1892
01:41:44,808 --> 01:41:46,978
look in the Live Stream series, like the

1893
01:41:46,984 --> 01:41:50,606
paper discussions in the 33 series,

1894
01:41:50,638 --> 01:41:52,378
there's a dot zero video with background

1895
01:41:52,414 --> 01:41:54,486
and context. And then we have a dot one

1896
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:56,134
and a dot two conversation with the

1897
01:41:56,172 --> 01:41:58,982
authors. But Avel, who's also the course

1898
01:41:59,036 --> 01:42:02,520
coordinator for this course and research

1899
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:06,410
Avel's and colleagues work has

1900
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,098
heavily built on the seeing like a

1901
01:42:09,104 --> 01:42:11,894
state, thinking like a state optimal

1902
01:42:11,942 --> 01:42:15,050
grasp all these different topics.

1903
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:21,236
I'm on your YouTube channel. I'm

1904
01:42:21,268 --> 01:42:23,336
slightly finding it hard to find the

1905
01:42:23,358 --> 01:42:26,744
thing. If you look

1906
01:42:26,782 --> 01:42:30,024
up Live Stream 33.0 or

1907
01:42:30,062 --> 01:42:32,100
if you go to in the video description of

1908
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:34,664
any video where it says all live streams

1909
01:42:34,712 --> 01:42:37,128
here, go there and search for but you'll

1910
01:42:37,144 --> 01:42:39,708
find it. And you can always email us or

1911
01:42:39,794 --> 01:42:42,908
get in contact. But yeah, and I think a

1912
01:42:42,914 --> 01:42:45,392
sales paper Thinking Like a State also

1913
01:42:45,446 --> 01:42:49,250
can help you a lot to understand how

1914
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:52,544
active inference modeling is useful for

1915
01:42:52,582 --> 01:42:54,564
the social sciences in comparison to

1916
01:42:54,602 --> 01:42:56,964
other types of modeling. He makes a

1917
01:42:57,002 --> 01:42:59,670
comprehensive description. Interesting.

1918
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,350
Great, thanks. And this is our first

1919
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:09,384
iteration on this course. We are going

1920
01:43:09,422 --> 01:43:12,456
to continue bringing new information to

1921
01:43:12,478 --> 01:43:14,824
the table and supporting individuals who

1922
01:43:14,862 --> 01:43:18,328
want to build generative models around

1923
01:43:18,414 --> 01:43:21,276
this area, whether it's part of an

1924
01:43:21,298 --> 01:43:23,228
internship program or part of a course

1925
01:43:23,314 --> 01:43:25,096
credit or different kinds of programs

1926
01:43:25,128 --> 01:43:27,150
that we'll be able to develop.

1927
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:31,592
But this is the real thing,

1928
01:43:31,746 --> 01:43:33,984
and we're able to work with people who

1929
01:43:34,022 --> 01:43:37,970
want to think and do. Makes sense

1930
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:42,444
indeed. Any closing thoughts, TJ?

1931
01:43:42,572 --> 01:43:44,228
Then I will go and then Lorena with the

1932
01:43:44,234 --> 01:43:47,956
last word. No, this was

1933
01:43:47,978 --> 01:43:49,860
great. Thanks for the conversation.

1934
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,992
Thank you. Well, thank you for Brennan

1935
01:43:53,056 --> 01:43:56,836
TJ for joining Lorena for the lecture.

1936
01:43:56,948 --> 01:43:59,464
This was a fun discussion. We never

1937
01:43:59,502 --> 01:44:02,408
really know where how it's going to go,

1938
01:44:02,494 --> 01:44:06,056
but I'm glad that we could cover so

1939
01:44:06,078 --> 01:44:09,980
many of these topics and probably

1940
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:13,180
raise more questions and footholds

1941
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,884
than door slams. So thank you again,

1942
01:44:15,922 --> 01:44:20,024
Lorena. Yeah, thank you for inviting

1943
01:44:20,072 --> 01:44:23,896
me. And I think active inference holds

1944
01:44:23,928 --> 01:44:25,696
a lot of space for experimenting as

1945
01:44:25,718 --> 01:44:28,576
well. Some things you try to see if they

1946
01:44:28,598 --> 01:44:30,224
make sense and if they're going to hold

1947
01:44:30,262 --> 01:44:33,504
up and open new questions, and that

1948
01:44:33,542 --> 01:44:37,856
might be an interesting aspect of

1949
01:44:37,878 --> 01:44:39,170
the framework itself.

1950
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:43,136
Thank you, everybody. Thank you,

1951
01:44:43,158 --> 01:44:44,924
everybody, for the great live chat

1952
01:44:44,972 --> 01:44:47,144
comments. There's a lot there. I

1953
01:44:47,182 --> 01:44:50,090
couldn't read it all. So till next time.

1954
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:50,900
Bye.
