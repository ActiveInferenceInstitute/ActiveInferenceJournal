6810	8120	2	B	0.53971	Hello and welcome.
8650	11862	3	B	1	It is September 12, 2023.
11996	26098	4	B	0.85307	We're here in the Active Inference for the Social Sciences course at the Active Inference Institute and having a discussion section on semiotics and semantics here with Lorena Ganzerla.
26274	29294	5	B	0.73679	We're going to be having a fun discussion, I hope.
29412	34458	6	B	0.99917	If you're watching Live, please feel free to write any questions in the Live chat.
34634	38682	7	B	0.98131	If you thought about joining and you weren't sure, it's not too late.
38826	46978	8	B	0.96906	Otherwise, we're going to pick up on some key points from the lecture and on the topic and see where we go.
47064	56200	9	B	0.90672	So, Lorena, welcome back and however you want to begin, let's go from there.
57450	58246	10	C	0.56	Okay.
58428	58918	11	C	0.99977	Hello.
59004	60710	12	C	0.99998	Thank you, Daniel.
62170	75978	13	C	0.99764	So let's try to recap a little bit where we left off during the lecture just to remind us where we were.
76064	94866	14	C	0.99911	Like, my point, what I was trying to articulate was the idea of what does it mean to talk about a formal semantics in a way that is not really loaded because it's an interesting thought.
95048	101314	15	C	0.95336	Like to have a semantics that is actually only formal, right?
101432	110214	16	C	0.99999	In principle, it would be relative to meaningful to meaning, right?
110412	120040	17	C	0.67556	In the notion that active inference is trying to cash it out.
124170	133630	18	C	0.70305	It's more like an idea or a way of modeling how we deal with meaningful situations.
134450	142530	19	C	1	And to understand that in a more interesting, more embodied and more concrete way.
142600	166570	20	C	1	I was suggesting that we could use biosemiotics as a as a model and as a theory for living creatures like language users to navigate the realm of symbols.
168510	210550	21	C	0.98	And gave one example which came from James Cott, which is the European forestry that comes with a practice understanding this scientific understanding of forests as a practice that allows us to refer to meaningful things in the environment in terms of what is valuable, what's interesting and what is not and interestingly, what is more important also from what becomes valuable.
211130	218754	22	C	1	It is what is cropped out from the meaningful perspective.
218802	228098	23	C	0.99981	So things natural parts of nature becomes left out or understood as something that is not desirable.
228214	253960	24	C	0.99	And you just understand what you don't want in your articulating principle as wheats or something that you should get rid of in respect to what is more desirable in terms of crops and how you understand nature in a more commoditized way.
260010	271690	25	C	0.95	And I find, like this example from Scott kind of very elucidating in the book.
271760	281614	26	C	0.89735	He creates this in the book, he's talking about states how we articulate life around one specific notion of state.
281812	287434	27	C	0.5476	But in this specific example, he has the idea of one official observer.
287562	338340	28	C	0.87	And this official observer establishes a principle of meaning in a way, you have to have a handle of nature, and that also articulates how villages and how practices around agriculture and how people relate to each other within these practices gets organized specifically for one interesting point that he makes that is to appreciate the constriction of that is like a vision that notices not what within the meaningful crops, but which is left outside the field of vision.
341240	379010	29	C	1	And I bring that specifically to understand how the fragility principle can or could be connected to a generalized synchronization over time in relation to those symbols and those practices in terms of niche construction and how this niche construction brings along with the symbolic use of language, predictive value.
386410	387206	30	B	0.99098	Thank you.
387308	394710	31	B	0.23137	Brynn, want to bring up any thoughts on that or any other pieces or I'm happy to add a comment.
405120	413372	32	B	0.60218	Brynn okay, guess not.
413426	414030	33	C	0.62	Okay.
417780	419104	34	B	1	A lot to say there.
419222	422444	35	B	0.51918	There was a little bit of a double play with what is cropped.
422572	431300	36	B	1	On one hand, what is cropped is the industrial crop that is being prepared.
433640	436964	37	B	0.99	And then the other side of that coin is what is cropped out.
437162	444088	38	B	1	And what we crop in is the part that we're paying attention to and we can't pay attention to everything.
444254	447364	39	B	0.92051	So it's like two sides of the same coin.
447492	457420	40	B	0.99998	What we pay attention to, what we include in attention in our cognitive awareness, leaves the shadow, which is what we exclude.
457920	462910	41	B	1	And that could be like the weeds or the other ecosystem services.
463360	480016	42	B	0.99996	So by highlighting the meaning or one dimension of meaning or one stance on meaning, it's like a seesaw that becomes salient to the extent that something else must be deprioritized.
480208	484336	43	B	0.94219	So that's how we accentuate these distributions of meaning.
484528	493450	44	B	1	And what do we get from active inference and free energy principle beyond, for example, what's provided in seeing like a state?
494540	496344	45	B	1	I think there's a lot we could say on that.
496382	511224	46	B	0.99956	But one piece is we get a process theory, a real procedural approach to how different systems come to do sense making and cognition and action.
511352	535568	47	B	0.99571	So just describing the lay of the land or the history of forestry in Europe or any other state of affairs in the world, merely describing it may not even help us determine what's going to happen a short time later, let alone a long time later, or what might happen in a very different ecology.
535744	557848	48	B	0.54691	Whereas if we understand the processes of sense making and decision making that different kinds of cognitive agents do, certainly humans also though states as cognitive entities, which is what seeing like a state or thinking like a state entails, we get a process based view on what otherwise might be merely descriptive.
557944	568210	49	B	1	And along with that process based view, we gain an increased ability to make unique explanations, predictions, accounts, and so on.
570580	591032	50	C	0.68	Yeah, we can also understand it in a different perspective in terms of realizing what becomes sensitized and what becomes desensitized along the process.
591086	598824	51	C	0.85379	So you can possibly model that using these kind of tools and understanding how that happens over time.
599022	609284	52	C	1	I don't know how much in terms of prediction of things that were not foreseen in these descriptions, we can achieve.
609412	624172	53	C	0.99864	In fact, you can achieve some level for sure, but that system should be decide how that delivers a very all encompassing prediction.
624316	626912	54	C	0.99915	In this case, I don't believe it can.
626966	627184	55	B	0.99906	Right.
627222	662590	56	C	0.98	I don't think that's the purpose as well, but we can at least have which might not be as positive as we want, but I think we can understand how we can gain some understanding in this process of being more sensitive or less sensitive to specific primes and how these organizational principles, how powerful they become over time.
666060	673032	57	B	0.98	Yeah, I'll read some comments in the chat and then Lorena or Brent feel free to just give any thoughts.
673096	676780	58	B	0.92161	Just upcycle club wrote hello.
676930	690320	59	B	0.38317	Biomimicry can enhance biosemiotics by showing us how nature solves problems and creates beauty through signs and codes and by encouraging us to apply these principles to our own creations.
692200	703972	60	C	0.7	Yeah, the idea of coding is an interesting idea, but to talk about codes, I don't think that's my take.
704026	705510	61	C	0.99948	Right, I don't understand.
706360	714948	62	C	1	We haven't coded any type of principles within our cognitive ability.
715044	735260	63	C	0.99517	But biologically speaking, however, you can understand these encodings in terms of becoming more or less sensitive over time to environmental cues as the example in terms of I use the example of forestry.
735340	736064	64	C	0.99991	Right.
736262	744900	65	C	0.99995	So in that specific case, what?
744970	752580	66	C	1	You become more sensitive and the more you organize your life, or social life is organized around specific principles.
753240	785280	67	C	1	Then you can make sense of these relational stories instead of just leveraging one full difficult to explain notion of encoding in terms of social cognition because it will be hard to explain how the brain will be encoding these specific symbols, but they can be cashed out in the environment relationally in terms of those organizational principles.
786500	806010	68	C	1	And then you have this idea of biomimicry like this reiterations and how that comes along to explain what this mimic or this meme will be then not so straightforward, I think.
807740	817392	69	B	0.99658	Well, certainly decompiling the source code of nature is somewhere between challenging and misguided or impossible.
817556	827096	70	B	0.99921	But that notion of a code script for biology has animated discussions of life, going back to, for example, Schrodinger's.
827128	827916	71	B	0.99996	What is life?
828018	831388	72	B	0.99892	He basically says there's two aspects of living systems.
831484	845136	73	B	0.99985	There's their organizational capacity, their negantropic capacity, and then there's their code script, their Apyotic crystalline informational repository.
845328	855028	74	B	1	And then another place that coding comes up a little bit less in the source code space is predictive coding.
855204	865556	75	B	1	And that's in a way highly compatible with active inference and gives a deflationary account on how the semiotics are encoded.
865748	882290	76	B	1	Rather than saying, well, this is what this variable in the source code means, or this is what this codes for, or here's a code switch, predictive coding is like saying we're not even going to touch the semantics of what the sign is itself.
882980	895552	77	B	0.96798	We're just going to hypothesize that the way that information about the sign is transferred is through this maximum information signaling approach called predictive coding.
895696	908632	78	B	1	Because predictive coding arose out of video compression algorithms and only at the end of the 90s was found to be increasingly relevant for neural circuitry and so on.
908766	928110	79	B	0.99992	So it's another example of where like a process based approach ends up deflating or reframing the otherwise semantically loaded question.
929360	934370	80	B	0.62122	It's like switching out the question of where we're going to be with how we're going to get there.
934820	944076	81	B	1	And instead of only focusing on the meaning of the signs first off, as if the meaning of the signs could be discussed outside of their implementation.
944268	951296	82	B	1	And then even if we could figure out what the signs were, we would then just turn around and want to know how they were transmitted.
951488	973020	83	B	1	And so predictive coding or predictive processing in a way short circuits that or inverts it by first looking to explain how information is transmitted that could support semiotics and then in the context of biological systems we naturally have biosemiotics.
976630	983382	84	C	1	Yeah, I would ask the question when you talk about information being transmitted right, what that actually means.
983436	998230	85	C	1	And I think that's a very big topic and a very large discussion in terms of information theory when specifically applying that into biological systems.
998390	1011982	86	C	0.94	I think there are some interesting people working on information that makes the case that Shannon has a point and he's really interested not in the semantics or in the meaning or anything else.
1012036	1015194	87	C	0.56438	He's kind of interested in the problem of transmission.
1015322	1034280	88	C	0.75	And when you talk about transmission, it's worth to ask what is being transmitted exactly in the terms of signals, even if you're capturing specific patterns and you think that the pattern is the thing that will be transmitted in that sense.
1034810	1050300	89	C	0.74535	But that will be a worth asking question to understand this notion of what is actually being transmitted in that sense.
1051710	1068910	90	C	0.95164	This information theory is focusing on this notion of the problem of transmission and then all the concepts that come along to explain that in terms of uncertainty or noise and everything that impacts these transmissional processes.
1070790	1082582	91	C	1	And if you're saying like we're transmitting information in this sense that is breaking this semantic code apart yes it is.
1082636	1085734	92	C	0.99991	Because the problem is not focused on that.
1085852	1107040	93	C	0.68717	It's that focusing on the specific correlations that we have that we call they were mentioning as information and how these correlations are an issue from the get go, from what is being picked up in one side being correlated to what comes into the other side.
1108530	1112000	94	C	0.99999	How do you lose or gain more information in that?
1113090	1130098	95	C	0.99851	But the deeper question here is how can you say that you are actually gaining or losing that information because you are defining this correlation that could be transmitted or not from the get go?
1130184	1136150	96	C	0.99998	If you don't have that, you don't have anything being actually communicated.
1138010	1156038	97	C	0.66903	So with that in mind, you can explain these concepts in terms of function, and then there's a bunch of theories that navigate this sense of signaling that is specifically only functional.
1156134	1164900	98	C	0.58	And then predictive coding tries to push that a little further, maybe.
1166150	1175474	99	C	0.99978	But then you have to explain in a deep sense how this information is being actually transmitted and processed.
1175522	1180920	100	C	1	And I don't think that is really as obvious and as clear as we think it is.
1184660	1211352	101	C	0.74215	Specifically when we're talking about this biological way of nature, navigating this signaling we have to talk about because the correlation, if it's defined abenishi from the beginning, then only have this kind of transmission for someone specific that can be able to understand that in the other side.
1211406	1212010	102	C	0.60086	Right?
1215500	1237404	103	B	0.99994	Well, certainly whether we're talking about a chemical pheromone that requires some type of receptor or something more ephemeral like language that requires more of a semantic reference frame, there's no receiving the message without the sender.
1237452	1240610	104	B	0.99275	It's like they're kind of the two sides of the phone call.
1241220	1243840	105	B	0.99857	I'll ask a question from the chat?
1244900	1246240	106	B	0.99991	Love evolve.
1246760	1254020	107	B	0.8945	How about cultural encoding and principles in contrast to organizational?
1255000	1260840	108	B	0.99997	So how do we think about cultural meaning?
1262460	1266200	109	B	0.62	And is that similar or different than organizational?
1269100	1270216	110	C	0.99965	That's a good point.
1270318	1270632	111	C	0.99408	Right.
1270686	1307860	112	C	1	I think if you take very seriously the example from the forestry is a practice, then I think it has to be organizational in that sense, the meaning navigate this organizational practice, this organizational story that impacts not only communication between agents but also how the environment will be interpreted.
1311100	1315736	113	C	0.9488	In this sense, it will be transmitted and repeated over time because it has a history.
1315838	1323668	114	C	0.58	You cannot ignore the history of these practices being pushed further and replicated through generations.
1323764	1324504	115	C	0.99275	Right.
1324702	1358340	116	C	0.8124	So the way the villages will be organized in terms of that specific practice, for instance, can be understood in a meaningful and cultural way that organizes life in virtue of some specific principles that sensitizes our agents towards specific directions.
1360600	1374290	117	C	1	And I think I don't know if you get my point.
1375780	1407246	118	C	0.99998	For instance, you can talk about, if you think about archaeological findings and how archaeological descriptions of specific villages and how they navigate this mapping out these archaeological sites.
1407358	1418470	119	C	0.99997	They usually know exactly if you have some kind of history already from these communities, how that city will be likely to be organized.
1418890	1421354	120	C	1	First off, where is the water?
1421472	1439306	121	C	1	And if the water is in certain directions, probably there will be certain kinds of relationships with housing and communal housings and where they're going to place their dead in relation to this kind of specific organizational principle.
1439338	1444190	122	C	1	The water is here, so plantations will be not so far away from that.
1444340	1457300	123	C	1	And the city organizes like the village organizes a little bit in this sense and that builds up cultural practices, at least archaeologically, can be explained as such.
1460010	1471334	124	B	0.99	I thought of something similar organization being the logistical or the operational structural aspects.
1471382	1481450	125	B	0.87122	So those would be the roads that connect the forestry outposts or the circulatory system that connects the different organs of organization.
1482030	1489470	126	B	1	And then the culture is a cause and a consequence of organization.
1490530	1494314	127	B	0.94919	Organization is the enabling conditions for culture to arise.
1494362	1499486	128	B	1	Okay, so given this road network, what cultures arise?
1499678	1502494	129	B	1	How similar or different are they convergently?
1502542	1508210	130	B	1	What are their practices or their narratives that are shared amongst these different outposts?
1508870	1524730	131	B	1	Or in the bodily example, okay, given the organization of the organs, literally the organizing process or principle, then what biosemiotics can arise with glucose and insulin and glucagon?
1525070	1536410	132	B	1	And what culturally can arise, maybe even in terms of the generative model of encultured agents as a function of organization?
1536490	1543950	133	B	1	And then what do those encultured agents do to the extent that they can modify organization?
1544370	1575850	134	B	0.99	And so these kinds of unrolling cause and consequence relationships can be hard to disentangle because there's not like a clean single starting point that can be separated out or because it unfolds historically, it's not exactly a reaction in a test tube.
1577230	1584720	135	B	0.99994	So how does active inference give us an entry point into thinking about this?
1586210	1597522	136	C	1	Yeah, that's one interesting thing about active inference that you don't really need an origin point, right?
1597576	1608760	137	C	1	You can start modeling and start understanding that at any given point and build up from that story and see how it unfolds over time.
1610250	1627354	138	C	1	I think that's the most beautiful idea, that you define your parameters and then you see from that parameters that can be arbitrarily defined and you can navigate how things change within those parameters in the generative model, right.
1627552	1644902	139	C	0.9999	When you have your dynamical systems, for instance, you have your state space, they have some specific range of defining parameters that set the limits of the possible states that you're going to navigate.
1645066	1673100	140	C	1	And if you use this notion that these two densities brings about in terms of Bayesian modeling, you can use these kinds of tools to understand how from that specific parameters update what we narrate in active inference, as if belief updating can change over time in these terms.
1675470	1678314	141	B	0.97073	That's a very nice point.
1678432	1704526	142	B	1	It reminds me of Bruno Latour's Actor Network Theory, or Ant, which kind of advocates a similar approach to what you described, which is like enter anywhere open mindedly, because in an Iterated modeling or Iterated analysis setting, the first proposal or the first trace detected, we know that's not the whole picture.
1704638	1706734	143	B	0.99991	There may not be a whole or only picture.
1706782	1731142	144	B	0.99998	So we need to enter and iterate and then with active inference, specifically because of the compositionality that we get within a layer, collective behavior, and then also the kind of nesting smaller things inside of bigger things, we can always build something and then we can go, oh wow, it's like there's a lot of top down influence.
1731286	1744560	145	B	1	Maybe there's a higher order factor or slower factor or a contextual factor we should consider or oh, we were abstracting across these smaller things inside.
1745030	1750180	146	B	0.99885	But for a later day or if relevant, we can dive in.
1750710	1761094	147	B	0.78	And so then it allows a light hold or a grasp on the proposed generative model.
1761212	1763350	148	B	0.99999	Obviously, it's map, not territory.
1763690	1793760	149	B	0.99999	But even beyond that, we always know that we can expand laterally and across scales starting from anywhere in an Iterated modeling process without our first or even 11th model being proposed as, like, the accounts of some complex cultural phenomena which we're always going to only ever have our own perspectives on.
1794690	1800094	150	C	1	Yeah, I think you don't really find that in being so all encompassing.
1800142	1803060	151	C	0.99988	Like you have one model that will model them all.
1804790	1809640	152	C	1	You can navigate those models in these more instrumental terms.
1810250	1849036	153	C	0.93	It raises different questions when you put things like that in terms of geontology of models and models and theories and sciences, but they can be also described as tools for describe tools for grasping and describing phenomena in a more non committal way, how much that how much that smuggles in philosophical or moral ontological problems.
1849138	1860204	154	C	0.9	It is still, I think, under debate, but it is still told.
1860242	1876512	155	C	0.69	You bring insights to think about specific cultural collective phenomena, which is not it's complicated because I think what I'm getting at, I'm kind of like going back and forth.
1876576	1898780	156	C	0.9994	But when you talk about social sciences and modeling, usually you have ways of modeling modeling agents or ways of modeling collectives and active inferences, trying to come up with a modeling in which you can understand agency and collectives within the same modeling schema.
1899520	1935708	157	C	1	And I think specifically for these cases, if you're interested in understanding types of cultural phenomena among language users in specific contexts, you can at least partially understand or gain some insight in this agent collective relationship that is a little bit more interesting than we have found so far in the social sciences, because you can have our specific understandings of memes.
1935824	1937368	158	C	0.99993	But then how the agent?
1937534	1939576	159	C	0.84571	Where is the agency in that?
1939758	1948716	160	C	1	You lose a little bit of agency when you're trying to understand only agents.
1948818	1970240	161	C	1	Then you don't know how that kind of scales up because active inference tries and offers these scale free modeling tools that facilitate this conversion into agents and collectives.
1971400	1983620	162	C	1	I would be interested in asking you, actually, how do you navigate that when you talk about social phenomena in ants or termites?
1987870	1999870	163	C	0.99996	Because then you have very specific coding demarcations, I guess, for these social environments.
2002900	2005344	164	B	0.92	Yeah, it's a great question.
2005462	2015120	165	B	0.52015	It's also whether it's an open wound or a dirty closet that's just shut.
2015280	2020390	166	B	0.90576	There's actually a lot of ambiguity and unresolved tension around.
2020760	2023828	167	B	0.99994	Well, is the ant colony social?
2023914	2030200	168	B	0.99998	Are they social insects that reifies the nest mate as the individual?
2030350	2033624	169	B	1	And then what they're doing is like when we hang out and talk.
2033822	2038200	170	B	0.99965	So reifying the nest mate as individual makes the colony social.
2038350	2051036	171	B	0.99999	But if the colony is individual, then what nest mates are doing with each other is not social any more than we would describe the liver and the kidney as having like a social single cellular interaction.
2051068	2052930	172	B	1	But we know that would be missing the point.
2054340	2065456	173	B	1	And so there definitely is attention with some of these evolutionary lineages, like ants being monophyletically obligate usocial all.
2065558	2070704	174	B	1	And only ants are eusocial they all live in the colonies.
2070752	2088040	175	B	0.83828	There's no free living nest mate whereas other parts of the evolutionary tree there are life histories that do look a little bit more like social collaboration that can then dissolve.
2088800	2096590	176	B	1	And so knowing what level of lock in makes something social.
2097600	2099240	177	B	0.9955	When are we socializing?
2099400	2103184	178	B	1	And what level of lock in goes beyond social.
2103302	2131050	179	B	0.57	And it kind of like makes when the blanket is so strong around the social that like for multicellularity that it's kind of losing the social feature again because if we just use social to mean the connective tissue or the kind of lubricant or the spaces between everything, then it means nothing.
2131900	2139950	180	B	0.99984	So a real tension is what space does the social account for?
2141600	2147820	181	B	0.86	And is this going to be a concept with a lot of creep looking?
2147890	2158284	182	B	0.84375	Well, it's a social relationship between the roots of the tree and the fungus and it's a social relationship amongst the molecules in the test tube.
2158332	2161120	183	B	1	Is that too broad of a social conception?
2162280	2170340	184	B	0.99066	Are there downsides or are there trade offs associated with a broader social concept?
2171080	2173476	185	B	0.99999	Do we dilute what the social means?
2173578	2182730	186	B	0.7	And then on the other side, might we exclude phenomena that could importantly be considered social?
2184060	2186856	187	B	0.98419	Well, that's not social, they're just talking on a train.
2187038	2188844	188	B	0.91139	It's like well that's the other side.
2188962	2199470	189	B	1	If we were to have carving out encounters that we do want to include as a social and is there a true social?
2200500	2206720	190	B	0.99978	Does active inference help us sidestep or at least negotiate this territory?
2208260	2236040	191	B	0.99999	Because we could develop a generative model or an ecosystem of shared intelligence with one person and two internet of things devices and a bird and a metronome and just say we made what we made and then leave it as a second order interpretation whether that is a social setting.
2239420	2246124	192	C	0.59	I mean, I think you are pointing at the granularity of those scales, right?
2246162	2259010	193	C	0.99979	If you have a model that one to one to everything that you already have, it's probably not interesting and not informative because you cannot define those limits of what you're trying to understand.
2260260	2275030	194	C	0.98	And in the other hand, when you do that, when you define those limits, if you're too narrow or you're going to leave out you're going to idealize also in a way, right, and leave out many other parts of the system that you're interested in.
2275800	2296190	195	C	0.99492	But if you don't do that, if you don't make this decision, if you don't make this decision when modeling anything then how you can have any access to the phenomena, right?
2296880	2306076	196	B	1	And to connect this to the forestry so in the forestry example, the desirada was lumber.
2306268	2315888	197	B	1	Now that may have been a very narrowly scoped desire, but it's a relevant thing to want this resource.
2316064	2333850	198	B	1	And then industrialization science as a process professionalization those allowed the description and the handling and ultimately the kind of top down legibility and control thinking like a forestry company.
2334380	2340792	199	B	1	Now with respect to the social sciences by analogy to forestry science.
2340936	2364544	200	B	0.5915	So now we're entering an era of increased legibility and control of social systems and human natural capital and attention as a resource, trust as a resource in a way is being cropped analogous to produce the content of lumber.
2364592	2366704	201	B	1	But now there are social contents.
2366752	2374390	202	B	0.99981	So as the social goes from being just only simply the water we swim in.
2374840	2389304	203	B	0.90365	Not something that's even compared counterfactually to alternative cultural possibilities per se, but falls under the scope of the professional management.
2389352	2392776	204	B	0.99998	Like forestry then that's.
2392808	2417270	205	B	0.99999	When this discussion of, well, what's the lumber and what is the weeds that are being pruned and what ecosystem services, when we pay attention to certain parts of human social culture, and when we seek to make more of this kind of lumber, what else does that come along with?
2418600	2423510	206	B	1	And what decisions come into play.
2425320	2428630	207	C	0.9995	That comes along when you see the process?
2458220	2459252	208	C	0.89	Or Instagram?
2459316	2459784	209	C	1	I don't know.
2459822	2460244	210	C	0.6506	Twitter?
2460292	2462860	211	C	0.99962	After what happened to Twitter.
2467200	2476370	212	C	0.57729	But yeah, in terms of attention pruning, you do have that very effectively already happening.
2477220	2483680	213	C	0.9	You can see how that happens efficiently in the voting elections for instance.
2484020	2496790	214	C	1	It can be very easily manipulated and we saw what happened in elections for instance in Brazil or in the well all over.
2501720	2530000	215	C	1	You navigate a system of attention organization that selects in only what he thinks that your interested in, in the effect of that in terms of decision making and in terms of trust, in terms of diversity of discourse, we have seen that it can be devastating.
2532980	2547940	216	C	1	The question would be like how can you use active inference and these tools that we have to make this kind of technology a little bit more inclusive without being super, also disruptive?
2549180	2557688	217	C	0.9	Is it even like a possibility?
2557864	2558844	218	C	0.65	I really don't know.
2558882	2567890	219	C	1	I think it's an ethical problem that we have when we talk about social systems and these principles of attention exclusion, leaving things out.
2576380	2578810	220	B	0.93444	Lot to say on that.
2579820	2601532	221	B	0.99995	With modeling and interpolating and models, whether it's large language model type or linear regression type, it is able to interpolate to put data points within an enclosure of what has already been described.
2601676	2608050	222	B	0.68	And Bayesian statistics and other types of prediction algorithms are not immune to that either.
2608420	2618070	223	B	0.99996	If we have some prior distribution belief, we believe it's possible for it to be between 20 and 30 degrees outside.
2619400	2629220	224	B	0.77	Then when we get data inside of our bounds we can converge and that actually tightens our beliefs.
2629380	2631224	225	B	0.99999	Not always a bad thing of course.
2631422	2639672	226	B	0.67	And then outside of the scope of the possible, those data are just seen as noise and they may not even be integrated.
2639736	2659680	227	B	0.99998	So then that can lead to a reinforcing process, not necessarily an adaptive one either, where information that's confirmatory is used to ratchet and increase precision and then information that is not confirmatory is discarded as not useful.
2663680	2673680	228	C	0.99729	In this case it doesn't even enter the landscape of attention of the user.
2681330	2710970	229	C	0.99884	What I was thinking in relation to this idea of forestry is because we have now organizational principles that are faster and more populated with information and attention grabbing kinds of prompts.
2712670	2734990	230	C	0.99946	We transform the same we transform the same principle into a harder to grasp process.
2736160	2737816	231	C	0.6	It becomes more complex.
2737928	2747500	232	C	1	It becomes harder to describe the process of understanding that in terms of forestry is kind of way more grounded.
2747660	2772632	233	C	0.99999	When you apply that socially to this kind of environment that we're talking like internet or this highly volatile and virtual in principle environment, it becomes much harder to assess what is being pruned out or not.
2772766	2773800	234	C	1	You just don't know.
2773870	2779252	235	C	1	It makes it more clear that there is a process of pruning.
2779316	2782750	236	C	0.71	You need to have no control of what is being taken out.
2783120	2790220	237	C	1	You have no idea what's being left away from your perspective of attention.
2792720	2803580	238	B	0.9999	So to this topic of intended or unintended semantic pruning, I think this has helped me identify attention.
2803660	2820656	239	B	0.99999	If we want to talk about the semantics or semiotics biosomiotics, whatever we want to call it, of the letter E in relationship to letter A, we're looking for an account that might convey leterness.
2820848	2824980	240	B	0.99966	But we're generalized above enis or anus.
2825560	2839420	241	B	0.9998	So in some ways we've erased or abstracted generalized away from the particulars of the sign meaning by taking a semiotic perspective.
2841440	2853680	242	B	1	And so it's like we got into the game to have a semantic account of biological phenomena or of any phenomena for a biological entity.
2854580	2870688	243	B	0.99998	Yet this process in a sense distances us from the particulars that actually do grant it that meaning in the actuality.
2870864	2883070	244	B	0.9998	Like if we walk into a sacred space and it's like oh well, that is just doing that over there and this architecture is doing this and because of the layout people must use the room this way.
2884720	2899600	245	B	0.9985	That's removed from the actual meaning which is the cause and consequence with the organization and culture that we discussed.
2900740	2920840	246	B	0.9998	But that prima fascia account doesn't generalize yet any generalization that we make so that we can talk about multiple places or multiple letters on a common accounting framework is going to remove those particularities.
2923820	2927416	247	B	0.99989	So it's a very challenging catch 22.
2927598	2949810	248	B	0.99999	Whether we want to really account for the N equals one and maybe even live and act and play and work in the N equals one versus develop something that might be satisfying and cut and dry, but it's always going to be on the sidelines with respect to what it actually means.
2952420	2954530	249	C	0.84684	But what do you mean?
2955140	2957680	250	C	1	I don't understand what you're getting at.
2957750	2961776	251	C	0.54	Is it you mean it's generalized or not generalized?
2961888	2963430	252	C	0.59	I didn't get that.
2964760	2978090	253	B	0.94562	When we generalize, when we ask what words mean, what words mean beyond any given word, we've lost touch with what any given word means.
2980300	2984910	254	B	1	But words are what they actually mean in a situation.
2986400	3002544	255	B	0.99996	So it's just in this scientific approach to meaning semiotics and semantics we have these two tensions or a tension to.
3002582	3039980	256	B	0.50662	Reconcile between actually giving an account of the meaningfulness of the specific thing versus taking a more scientific approach, which would be gathering a group of similar things and finding their shared attributes, which out of necessity must abstract, must crop out features that are empirically or anecdotally taken to not matter.
3040130	3044060	257	B	0.9989	Like, we abstract whether it was a Monday or Tuesday that we did the experiment.
3044560	3049040	258	B	0.99986	We just combine all of our replicates together when we do the scientific analysis.
3054380	3059556	259	C	0.64	You mean if you generalize the practice, you lose what you've been?
3059678	3071384	260	C	0.9992	If you generalize it too much, you lose everything that's meaningful to you in terms of, like you formalize it and then you have an empty semantics.
3071432	3078940	261	C	0.97	You have a semantics with no meaning that can only be meaningful in terms of how you apply that in terms of specific practices.
3079100	3085856	262	B	1	Yeah, it's like I have a framework for the formal meaning of letters within words, within sentences, within paragraphs.
3085888	3088128	263	B	0.74	And then it's like, well, but now what's?
3088144	3091670	264	B	0.91487	Your next N equals one word that you're actually going to bring?
3093880	3101880	265	B	0.9999	It's not just about building some abstract scaffold for bigger and bigger boulders of meaning.
3102540	3122510	266	B	1	At some point, through our embodied thought and action in our experience, it is going to come down into the particulars, and it doesn't immediately seem clear that simply generalizing further brings us there.
3123940	3130540	267	C	0.97	Yeah, I don't really believe you can have that kind of generalization.
3130620	3140080	268	C	1	I think we attempt to build whatever what I see that's the interesting aspect of the formal thematics.
3140160	3158772	269	C	0.91	You try to build this more general understanding that just formalizes to model, but for that to be meaningful, it has to be embedded in a way of practicing it, like in a forestry practice.
3158836	3173330	270	C	0.47	It has to be embedded in a cultural environment in which that can be actually observed in terms of what happens when a generative model is being updated or not.
3175540	3176496	271	C	1	Is that what you mean?
3176518	3185344	272	C	0.99672	Because otherwise I don't really understand how it becomes too formal.
3185392	3190950	273	C	0.98	It becomes too abstract in terms of some I would not understand what that is.
3195780	3199212	274	B	0.99524	I'll think a little more. Bryn or TJ?
3199356	3203990	275	B	0.70504	Do you want to add any thoughts or questions?
3205960	3207028	276	A	0.98	Yeah, sorry.
3207194	3209904	277	A	0.99	I think I don't have a lot of context.
3209952	3215400	278	A	0.98897	I've been following some of the discussion but not attended a lot of these calls.
3215820	3216810	279	B	0.95986	It's all.
3220460	3221704	280	A	0.99	Yeah, I don't know.
3221822	3247824	281	A	0.94	I think I'm, in general, just sort of interested in trying to understand the relationship between sorts of constructionist epistemologies and generative models and active inference style stuff and how active inference style, like yeah.
3247862	3253488	282	A	0.99968	What are the philosophical commitments that active inference involves with respect to knowledge and epistemology?
3253584	3267290	283	A	0.94	And there's a sense in which rational choice models often assume a certain sort of objectivity to beliefs and then desires are where most of the degrees of freedom lie or something.
3268220	3284588	284	A	0.92347	Whereas there's a lot of issue, like there's a lot of things that come up once you start talking about reflexivities where concepts themselves become self fulfilling prophecies, what your beliefs about society ends up shaping the society itself.
3284674	3291504	285	A	0.99977	So there's a sense in which there's this codependence between the object of knowledge and knowledge about that object itself.
3291622	3303750	286	A	1	And I think yeah, I'm sort of interested in how the active entrance ways of thinking about this offers what perspectives on those questions and stuff like that.
3307400	3308148	287	B	0.99999	Thank you.
3308234	3309910	288	B	0.99937	Great questions.
3312380	3334530	289	C	0.99937	So when you talk about the object of knowledge and the knowledge itself and active inference, I think you can think of in terms of this.
3338150	3340674	290	C	0.99959	Well, there's a few ways to think about that.
3340712	3353858	291	C	1	I guess the knowledge itself has to come epistemically from where your agent is actually embedded and situated.
3353954	3357046	292	C	0.55786	Specifically in active inference, it's embodied.
3357238	3360300	293	C	0.85	It kind of needs to have a model.
3361550	3376602	294	C	1	The model is modeling a body is modeling a body that is in the world and it's all the time situated, is never disconnected to its environment and the history of that environment.
3376666	3378320	295	C	0.99993	Right, yeah.
3381270	3401830	296	C	0.99986	But if you think if you push that to the object of that knowledge, I don't know how different that will how different how can you differentiate that so sharply when you talk about active imprints?
3403050	3425390	297	C	0.99997	Because if you think of in terms of a generative model, what will be updated is updated from a prior that is always directed in this body, in this situated realm.
3426290	3446310	298	C	0.99997	So they sort of conflated as I see, maybe I'm mistaken, but they sort of conflate in how you're going to update your generative model, which would be at the same time what you know and what the object of this knowledge?
3448570	3452294	299	A	0.99995	Sorry, if I can just raise a question to that.
3452412	3479086	300	A	0.99	Yeah, so I think that there is a sense in which with respect to something that in epistemology would be called self knowledge, there is a question here that the active inference agent has this model that is situated in the body or in its structure and is also modeling that structure itself.
3479188	3491490	301	A	1	And there is this issue of the belief is not unidirectionally dependent on the object sort of a thing, but has this feedback loop thing comes up there.
3491640	3503974	302	A	0.99997	But there's another way in which I think where this sort of thing comes, where even if the object is outside of the body of the knowledge, I think that could still come up.
3504012	3537682	303	A	0.99934	So, for instance, if an active inference agent lives in a society of other active inference agents, where currently all of them defect on prisoners dilemma, but maybe on further reflection, they would want to again, I don't know what further reflection would mean in the active inference sense, but I'm just saying in the intuitive sense, what would it mean for them to go from one fixed point to another fixed point where they're all cooperating or something like that?
3537736	3541714	304	A	0.96	And that, I think, is not clear to me.
3541752	3570730	305	A	0.77246	Like how that shift can happen in active inference where it's not just purely using the empirical information to keep running the mill of your free energy equation but also recognizing the contingencies and then identifying those contingencies to make something like shifts from one state to another.
3570880	3580938	306	A	0.92945	Like if I model that the society is a cruel space and if everyone models a society as a cruel space, then we will end up creating a society that is a cruel space.
3581124	3602790	307	A	0.99999	But if only we could recognize that our belief or our model that society is a cool space is a contingent belief and we could all somehow negotiate or communicate and shift to a different belief about what society is and society is a kind place, then we will end up creating that kinder society or something.
3602940	3609546	308	A	1	And that sort of like a belief about the thing that society is.
3609728	3612140	309	A	0.9998	It's not entirely within the agent.
3614910	3616966	310	A	1	It has a weird intersubjective character.
3616998	3623422	311	A	0.99963	So it's not entirely outside of the agent either, but it's not entirely internal to the agent either.
3623476	3624240	312	A	1	Or something.
3624930	3625680	313	B	1	Yeah.
3628290	3630974	314	C	0.81	You can think of that like you're talking about active inference.
3631022	3633060	315	C	0.93073	Action comes first, right?
3634230	3642734	316	C	1	You don't have the knowledge inside your head waiting for you to push that out of the action has to come first.
3642872	3652194	317	C	0.99833	So if you take that as a principle, an organizing principle, it depends on the contingency of your actions.
3652322	3660326	318	C	1	The possibilities might be limited by your situated condition, but they are limited.
3660438	3667994	319	C	1	It doesn't mean that you don't have a range of options from that state space in which you can navigate.
3668042	3677950	320	C	0.97682	So you can navigate it for the good or for the bad, but it starts with the action perception loop, starts with the action.
3680070	3680546	321	A	0.45	All out.
3680568	3682274	322	B	1	A few other pieces on that.
3682472	3684610	323	B	0.96189	TJ very good point.
3684680	3697558	324	B	0.79166	Like when we see the pragmatic component of action as self fulfilling epistemic component of action having to do with gaining knowledge and the salience of information.
3697644	3703106	325	B	0.99999	But the pragmatic component is about bringing our observations into alignment with our preferences.
3703298	3706726	326	B	1	And then you identified two related settings.
3706838	3717034	327	B	1	One of them is like pure intra subjectivity like I expect myself or I find myself or I habitually think about x.
3717232	3724510	328	B	0.99999	Well, that's kind of a trivial self fulfillment because thinking about something is its own fulfillment.
3725010	3738546	329	B	1	And then when we're in this second person or social space we can agree on little performance art or on a game and games give evidence to that.
3738728	3759990	330	B	0.9991	That when people are able to perform communication or message passing such that new expectations or preferences are set whether more top down, like more seeing, like a state or more laterally, more like collective behavior then those regimes can be embodied.
3760150	3768998	331	B	1	And then you brought up a very important point about the awareness of the contingencies or awarenesses of adjacent possibles or of counterfactuals.
3769174	3782450	332	B	0.63444	So the body might be we could model its morphology as doing some computation but that doesn't mean that the morphology has an awareness or can explore a counterfactual.
3783030	3790434	333	B	0.9995	Like bodies are not always exploring every counterfactual because Skin is in the game.
3790552	3808614	334	B	0.99998	But again, mentally it's very cheap and easy to consider counterfactuals and situational awareness of social settings, especially if it can be not just understood but communicated, opens up a space where we're all playing Prisoners Dilemma.
3808662	3818734	335	B	0.98	Now there's parameterizations of Prisoners multi agent Prisoners Dilemma where tragically, we just all defect all day and never learn.
3818932	3824350	336	B	0.99995	There's also parameterizations where you just start all cooperating and never defect.
3824690	3836530	337	B	1	And then the interesting settings are where there might be like phase transitions or where a perturbation moves the system from one attractor into another attractor.
3837190	3850870	338	B	0.64094	So there's just a lot of richness and that's the work of building generative models and that iterated modeling process to unpack and refine.
3851930	3857206	339	B	1	And active inference isn't going to have a stance on a Prisoner's dilemma.
3857398	3867130	340	B	0.99999	We can use active inference to describe the prisoner's dilemma, but active inference isn't going to come down on literally even a little two by two game theory matrix.
3867490	3882770	341	B	0.86893	So we can then extrapolate that active inference is not going to come down with an opinion on something significantly more rich and real than a two by two game theory matrix.
3883350	3892770	342	B	1	And so that work is what people enact in applying active inference.
3897410	3897966	343	A	0.9997	Right?
3898068	3924120	344	A	0.93	And I think my question is something like but insofar as humans try to constantly improve their social games, how can we model that sort of a prior over your actions or policies that enables that sort of progressive, um, improvements or something?
3925290	3931670	345	C	0.89763	Well, we are assuming that we're trying to improve.
3932090	3935450	346	C	0.99962	We don't know that, but you can model them as improving.
3935790	3947520	347	C	0.93248	But like following Daniel's lead, we're talking about these specific games and contingencies these transitions from one state to another.
3948290	3959074	348	C	0.88523	Specifically, if you're talking about this modeling of social actors and talking about several actors, if your model involves several of them, will not be really linear, right?
3959112	3975762	349	C	0.91	You don't have like an easy, smooth transition of improvement you can capture over time as modeling how they might tend to go towards a direction and understand that as improvement.
3975826	3983094	350	C	0.99997	But that takes specific iterations that will not be fully linear.
3983142	3997070	351	C	1	I guess specifically if you want to understand Error and improvement instead of Trier and Error but trier and adding up into this Error like Error improvement.
3997810	4013300	352	C	0.99996	But when you're modeling specifically with dynamical systems, for instance, you're not going to see a full linear story and I don't think you're going to see that if you're modeling using active inference and multiple agents.
4016310	4017762	353	B	0.84057	I'll add one piece there.
4017816	4046442	354	B	0.99977	So how could we go about modeling multiscale social goals so we could think about different citizens in a region and the modeler is going to choose what knowledge to realize in the generative model, like what you put into the calculator it's going to calculate upon.
4046586	4065490	355	B	1	Now this happens to be an elaborate stochastic method, but if we only tell people, yeah, there's just your personal income optimize for that, your preference is to have that be higher, well, then the simulation is going to unfold a certain way.
4065640	4079778	356	B	0.99999	If we say, well, there's your personal financial income and then there's your city and then there's your region, then that opens up through different mechanisms.
4079954	4089978	357	B	1	Maybe an individual goes flat or neutral on the personal in service of a larger win at a higher level.
4090144	4096346	358	B	0.99981	Well now what if the modeler says it's not just about the financial income now we're also going to have this secondary criterion?
4096538	4104110	359	B	0.99988	Well now different agents could attend differently to those two different outcome variables.
4104610	4112900	360	B	1	And maybe there's one simulation where 50% only care about this and 50% care about that and it works perfect or it doesn't work.
4114950	4132390	361	B	0.72322	It's like a broad surveying or Lego set or grammar or active inference ontology for scoping very broadly and very inclusively.
4133390	4150206	362	B	0.99852	But all the work is in the real simulation development and sweeping because very little could be said about a game theory game.
4150308	4164994	363	B	0.99998	If you didn't know what the parameters were in the matrix, you wouldn't know whether this Prisoner's Dilemma was going to be like an always cooperate or which agents with which strategies would or wouldn't cooperate if you don't know what the matrix looks like.
4165192	4178600	364	B	0.99946	So before the values have kind of been filled in, it's just like actually describing the adjacencies and the counterfactuals and the contingencies of our scientific model.
4180810	4185000	365	B	0.99998	But that's still prior to having the model in hand.
4186730	4193786	366	B	0.56415	So now we're looking at that tree in the European forest and it's like, well, if I had this tool, then I could cut it down this way.
4193808	4196382	367	B	1	If I had this tool, I could cut it down this way or I could wait.
4196436	4198910	368	B	0.6646	It's like that's.
4200450	4204030	369	B	0.52084	Alternative actions about that tree.
4204370	4214850	370	B	1	Now in the social science setting, discussion of different scientific methodologies are like counterfactuals about that social tree.
4226650	4227158	371	C	1	Yeah.
4227244	4260670	372	C	0.8	And specifically, if you're navigating these kinds of game theoretical models, if that's what you're interested in, you can even define in terms of prisoners dilemma, for instance, specific values to see what happens when everybody deflects and how frequent modulate those frequencies in terms of specific in multiple iterations.
4262610	4269742	373	C	0.99996	How are you going to build up the weight for the tendency of deflecting?
4269806	4288570	374	C	1	Again, if your neighbor deflected once and deflected twice or three times and see how that will accommodate over time how many times this agent will change its behavior until it stops changing the behavior.
4289710	4314722	375	C	0.52433	But you don't really again, you might use a Bayesian understanding Bayesian model for that, but it not necessarily explain it does not necessarily explain the action fully.
4314866	4321830	376	C	0.94	I mean, socially you're modeling only the interest of that specific actor.
4326090	4330060	377	A	1	I have a slightly meta question, if I can ask both of you.
4330510	4333420	378	A	0.97727	I'm not sure how these calls usually go.
4334190	4338170	379	A	0.98916	I'm curious what are your interests in active inference?
4338850	4347920	380	A	0.99236	What brings you to active inference and what do you think active inference adds to our theoretical understanding and in what ways or something.
4349890	4352260	381	B	0.60839	Lorena, go for it.
4353990	4377770	382	C	0.98967	Well, I think I was trying to touch upon that before and how we can, if you're navigating, for instance, behavior in terms of game theory, this kind of modeling, if you're talking about like trust games, for instance, you're going to understand how these two addict interactions evolve over time, specifically over interactions.
4378190	4390726	383	C	0.99942	But you don't have an account of change because you have very limited options of actions, and you don't have an account also on scales.
4390758	4414194	384	C	1	And I think active influence tries to edge a little bit an account on how you can scale that and how you can add more parameters into the game and see how they evolve with a more clear understanding, some richer understanding.
4414242	4417830	385	C	0.98474	That, for instance, when you talk about specific interactions in game theory.
4419770	4426670	386	C	0.74593	So that's one aspect that active inference kind of contributes.
4426850	4457042	387	C	0.99999	Another point is because we have this parameterization that is specifically in terms of belief updating and also in terms of dynamics, we are always talking about agents that will be situated and embodied and have a very specific synchronization with the environment all the time.
4457096	4461778	388	C	0.99999	Because when you talk about active inference, the action comes always first.
4461944	4466200	389	C	0.99989	So you try to have a less reductive model.
4468490	4475298	390	C	0.69	And when you want to model cultural agents and collective action, I think that's kind of desirable.
4475394	4476920	391	C	0.99315	That's what you're looking for.
4478510	4480540	392	A	0.96	Is it also your area of interest?
4481150	4481898	393	C	0.97261	Sorry?
4482064	4483980	394	A	1	Is it also your area of interest.
4487740	4490072	395	B	0.99855	Mine or is that Lorena's area of interest?
4490126	4494280	396	A	0.54879	Lorena's, what do you sorry.
4494350	4498264	397	A	0.62882	Like, my question was also like, what brings you to active inference?
4498312	4508188	398	A	1	And I think you answered a lot of ways in which active inference adds theoretical value, but I wasn't sure if that was also your subjective interest or motivation.
4508284	4509728	399	C	0.75462	It's my subjective interest.
4509894	4510608	400	C	1	Yeah.
4510774	4512832	401	C	0.99743	I'm curious to see how that pans out.
4512886	4513344	402	C	0.99988	Right.
4513462	4531370	403	C	0.99951	I'm interested in how that helps us to think of this type of phenomena, and I'm very interested in how this relationship from agents to collectives and back again work.
4535980	4558448	404	C	0.99	And I think it might give us some well, you give us some very insightful way of modeling these relationships and navigating it as you want, because this feature of being scale free is kind of helpful to looking things.
4558614	4567010	405	C	1	You can define your Markov blanket in terms of are you interested and see what happens.
4571830	4572706	406	C	0.71	I don't know.
4572808	4579330	407	B	0.81	Yeah, I'll just give a few thoughts, even though also, surely some of these thoughts are scattered.
4580550	4587160	408	B	1	You asked TJ, what does active inference add to our theoretical account of the social?
4587850	4596230	409	B	1	It does many things, in my view, and that's what makes it so valuable epistemically and pragmatically.
4596390	4605846	410	B	1	It gives us the expressivity within a scale to describe collective behavior and across scales to describe nested systems.
4605958	4618414	411	B	0.99993	So that brings continuity to discussions of the social with broader discussions of the biological, ecological, computational, physical, and so on.
4618532	4622210	412	B	0.99997	So that's a multiscaled transdisciplinary element.
4622550	4646794	413	B	0.83887	Active inference provides us with legible first principles which can either be taken instrumentally as just heuristics and also in certain situations can be viewed empirically as justifiable first principles and then from those legible first principles which are not.
4646832	4665630	414	B	0.99999	English specific, they're already in a space that has a lot more possibility and promise than, for example, a mere enumeration of important adjectives or nouns.
4666690	4675010	415	B	0.66615	We can develop lists of important adjectives and nouns when we have a broader cognitive modeling framework.
4675590	4684360	416	B	1	And so this methodological turn then supports just a tremendous diversity of thought and work.
4685610	4700060	417	B	0.99983	Instead of asking us to kind of go through the eye of the needle and get on board with this one ranking of features and then try to apply it more broadly, that's like an overfit before the Cart situation.
4700510	4714880	418	B	0.99975	With Actimf, we can expand the methodological discussion, connect it to theoretical physics and mathematics in ways that really haven't been seen before, and then that opens up more than it closes down.
4715250	4732430	419	B	1	It brings up more questions than it resolves in and of itself, but it opens the questions that can be resolved, like what generative model can I make that will keep the temperature in this building livable?
4732590	4736840	420	B	0.95778	But active inference isn't going to have a stance on what you should do for that building.
4738490	4752810	421	B	0.9998	So we need to, in a way, take a step in the methodological direction, which I see as moving towards active inference to enable a million steps in different directions.
4757310	4759360	422	A	0.98	I have a bunch of questions here.
4760690	4764640	423	A	1	I think one is probably just a reference question.
4765250	4767102	424	A	0.99834	There are three topics that I'll say.
4767156	4773278	425	A	1	If you guys have any papers or articles on those things, I would love to get a reference.
4773454	4784280	426	A	1	One is, in what ways can we model a collection or an aggregation of active inference agents as a super agent?
4785930	4788038	427	A	0.99485	Active inference, super agent or something?
4788204	4795582	428	A	0.99	And how does this decomposition and aggregation flexibility work in different contexts?
4795666	4805898	429	A	0.99992	If there's work that tries to either make informal commentary or formal modeling either ways, I would love to see that.
4805984	4806890	430	A	0.99955	Secondly.
4808770	4817934	431	B	0.9968	Just on the first, check out the previous section of this course on collective behavior, where I reviewed many such works.
4818132	4819038	432	A	0.99982	Great, thanks.
4819124	4821806	433	A	0.98	Okay, is it on the same notion?
4821998	4823614	434	A	0.85	Is it linked from the same notion.
4823662	4828002	435	B	0.99844	Thing all in the same places and in the same playlist with this course?
4828056	4829006	436	B	0.99999	Same syllabus?
4829118	4829538	437	B	0.99985	Yes.
4829624	4830210	438	A	0.99637	Got it.
4830280	4830900	439	A	1	Okay.
4831830	4846002	440	A	1	The second is, is there an active entrance account of, say, markets or economic interaction wherein your prices act as some sorts of information signals?
4846066	4853978	441	A	1	And can you use active inference to then talk about aggregation of market entities or something?
4854144	4857414	442	A	0.99999	I'm guessing this would also be covered in the same list.
4857552	4868138	443	B	0.87722	Indeed, people have explored cognitive economics, and people are working on it, but that doesn't mean it's a done deal theoretically or especially in practice.
4868314	4870240	444	B	0.9998	So keep going.
4870850	4874800	445	C	0.96115	It's quite experimental still, but there are a bunch of people working on that, I guess.
4875730	4883286	446	C	1	I don't remember any specific paper right now, but I can look it up and forward to you.
4883308	4885990	447	A	0.56517	But yeah, it would be great.
4886140	4888198	448	A	1	I can drop my email address here.
4888284	4889320	449	C	0.99	Yeah, sure.
4890250	4897770	450	A	1	The third is probably more trickier than both of these, which is, is there an active inference account of natural language?
4900910	4901418	451	B	0.99886	Yes.
4901504	4913290	452	B	0.99997	Thankfully, colleagues like Elliot Murphy and others have explored specifically the linguistic aspects of natural speech.
4913450	4930418	453	B	0.99	I think Lorena's lecture and area of focus generalizes a bit beyond specific natural language, because we're talking about semiotics and semantics in a more intermodal sense.
4930584	4938710	454	B	1	However, yes, there's been limited work from a computational linguistics and neurobiology perspective on speech.
4940650	4952006	455	A	0.99	Okay, so then okay, so you said something like first principles stuff.
4952108	4960566	456	A	0.99997	When you're making a commentary on what active inference brings, I'm still often struggling, what is active inference offering?
4960598	4962970	457	A	0.98	And I try to encounter different things.
4963040	4971550	458	A	1	I think I enjoy a lot of philosophical questions that the conversation opens up, but I'm still very ambivalent about the theory.
4972530	4982640	459	A	0.99	And when I read this new book, which Friston has not written but is a co author, I don't remember the name of the book.
4985830	4987154	460	A	0.91	Yeah, I don't exactly remember.
4987192	4994098	461	A	0.99978	There's a book, right, which is supposedly supposed to be the canon, and Friston is a co author, but in the.
4994104	5002182	462	B	0.9971	Preface, he says, so that's the 2022 Par Friston Pazula textbook, right?
5002236	5003800	463	A	0.99434	Par, yeah.
5004810	5012760	464	B	1	I wouldn't quite say it's the canon, since it's a short book, but certainly it is a landmark moment for the field.
5013710	5014170	465	A	0.99883	Right.
5014240	5028138	466	A	1	And when I read that, the one thing that bothered me was it brings up the helmet's free energy thing, but it sort of argues it by fiat.
5028234	5030778	467	A	0.81575	Like, okay, this is a simple principle.
5030874	5038386	468	A	1	It can model a lot of things, but that doesn't tell me why I should trust it.
5038568	5041266	469	A	0.99359	What is the reason to act?
5041448	5044450	470	A	0.98207	Why does this principle lead to cognition?
5046070	5068540	471	A	0.99837	Sure, you've posited a very simple principle and then said, hey, look, this simple principle can explain so many things, but well, it also explained things that don't look like cognition, and I'm not sure I got an account of why that principle is works or something.
5069870	5071150	472	B	0.46607	Lorena, go for it.
5071220	5073150	473	B	0.99617	I'll think of some other ways to say it.
5073220	5082430	474	C	0.59	Yeah, you can think of modeling by construction and modeling by first principles, and modeling by first principles.
5083490	5089220	475	C	0.91	You have some limitations in which you cannot fully explain some things.
5089590	5108840	476	C	0.99969	But the virtue of the model and how the first principle organizes everything that comes along with the model usually might be sufficient or might be a useful tool to help you explain that phenomena that based on the first principle that you were bringing along.
5109470	5114154	477	C	0.94	And that's one part of answering this question.
5114192	5118620	478	C	0.64	I think it might be a big question for the field.
5119870	5124560	479	B	0.62	Yeah, here's some short little threads on that.
5125330	5125838	480	B	0.72	Yeah.
5125924	5141406	481	B	0.99999	We can describe maladaptive cognitive systems or adaptive cognitive systems, whether something's adaptive or not is always in relationship to its niche, like the foraging algorithm that works in the desert doesn't necessarily work in the rainforest.
5141518	5146542	482	B	0.99985	So these systems are not like intrinsically adaptive or not.
5146696	5154626	483	B	1	We want to have natural language that allows sentences that are valid and invalid and have different kinds of semantics.
5154658	5164502	484	B	0.99947	So again, this is just an expressivity framework that enables people to build cognitive models of high reliability or important settings.
5164646	5172302	485	B	1	Or you could make something that looks just like a beautiful circuit board and not even worry about what the outcome is.
5172436	5175562	486	B	0.88	Yeah, for sure you can describe all kinds of systems.
5175706	5182254	487	B	0.9999	That would be like having a less than functional methodological system.
5182292	5190574	488	B	0.99993	If we said, well, we're doing a linear regression framework but we only want positive regressions, it's like, well, no, at the methodological level, we want it to be able to do any slope.
5190702	5198422	489	B	0.92625	So here in the cognitive modeling setting, we want more expressivity so that we can actually construct the ones that we're interested in.
5198556	5203830	490	B	1	And then how does this really do cognition?
5204410	5218090	491	B	1	How is it that a first principles like surprise minimization or the bounding of surprise through free energy, how can that really cover so many cognitive phenomena?
5218990	5221294	492	B	0.98974	That's the question and the play.
5221412	5229390	493	B	0.99731	But how is it that Newton's laws of motion can describe so many objects being dropped off a tower?
5230770	5238210	494	B	0.99919	How is it that Bayesian mechanics can describe so many different priors being updated?
5238950	5259574	495	B	1	And so by understanding cognitive paths as paths of least action, which is the free energy principle, a wide variety of models become of a similar kind, now become available.
5259772	5265334	496	B	1	Yeah, whether that's useful to a given person in a given setting.
5265382	5269110	497	B	0.9863	Like if you make an active inference model of your business, it doesn't mean you're going to succeed.
5269190	5273200	498	B	0.99987	If you make a self driving car with active inference, it doesn't mean it's going to work.
5273650	5280138	499	B	1	This isn't a guarantee of success, but it's a method that can be utilized.
5280314	5291330	500	B	0.64	And we know that the method reaches different kinds of modeling outcomes and supports subsequent perspectives and models from where it reaches.
5292310	5300898	501	B	0.99998	But we can't a priori limit where the method reaches to only the successful ones or only biological systems.
5301074	5306790	502	B	1	Then we wouldn't even have the expressivity to talk about cognitive ecosystems with synthetic intelligences.
5309850	5317382	503	C	0.53	And when you're talking about cognition also we can use these kind of first principles to model aspects of cognition.
5317446	5331034	504	C	0.99982	But you might not necessarily think that cognition is all encompassing like that everywhere all the same, but you can use that to model specific things that you're interested in in cognitive behavior, like adaptivity.
5331162	5336290	505	C	0.8071	Does it give me any insight to understand what is adaptive behavior, for instance?
5336950	5339618	506	C	1	And which kind of insights do I get?
5339704	5340626	507	C	0.99997	Are they interesting?
5340728	5341550	508	C	0.99999	Are they useful?
5341630	5347142	509	C	0.99994	So that's what the availability that this kind of model bring along.
5347276	5357880	510	C	0.87545	So you don't have to believe in the whole story, but it gives you a lot of leverage to ask questions and what kind of questions you'll be asking.
5361830	5391440	511	A	0.98	Okay, so let's say that active inference and free energy allows me to talk about systems, but does it also give me vocabulary to then classify those systems in terms of, let's say adaptivity would be one property, but there could be other properties in terms of how rich the world model is or stuff like that.
5393330	5411320	512	B	0.99955	If you have a portfolio of generative models, you could summarize them according to the TJ statistic, you could summarize them according to the number of nodes, you could put them into a common environment or different environments and summarize their activity in any number of ways.
5412010	5420280	513	B	0.99986	But we can't talk about a ranking or a summarization of a portfolio of generative models that's not in hand.
5420650	5439360	514	B	1	This is a framework that lets us build those diverse generative models and then in a very open ended way do model comparison, model selection, model adequacy, all the kinds of complex systems engineering methods that we want.
5441490	5450690	515	B	1	And also I would ask you, where do you see a peer or a comparison first principle?
5451910	5461042	516	B	0.99469	Active inference has legible first principles which are reflected in the active inference ontology and expressions using it, which can be represented in natural language.
5461106	5477430	517	B	0.99999	So that's the talking about it, but it's not only represented in natural language, other frameworks have other first principles that may or may not be legible and people may choose different paths to go down for whichever number of reasons.
5478410	5487680	518	C	0.6311	Well, you can compare them, right models like they have the virtue, you can compare them and see which one gives you the best insight that you're looking for.
5489010	5500926	519	A	0.53	Yeah, I think something that I could compare to active inference is like say the Bayesian utility maximization thing which has a different ontology.
5501118	5503060	520	A	0.65298	I'm not a fan of that either.
5504630	5516294	521	B	0.89265	I'll just note that Bayesian utility maximization is a special case of free energy where there's no Epistemic value, all you have is Pragmatic value and so a.
5516332	5520130	522	A	0.99973	Special diminished not necessarily.
5520210	5526860	523	A	1	You have value of information and you have explore exploit trade offs in Beijing utility maximization as well.
5529390	5538858	524	B	0.99992	If you load into your utility function, if you can beg the question and load Epistem into Pragma, you're right, then all you need is Pragma.
5538954	5546282	525	B	0.99965	But in expected free energy we have Epistemic and Pragmatic value, which is what enables us this expressivity.
5546426	5548500	526	B	0.99759	But I think we're aligned on that.
5550950	5551650	527	A	0.99212	Right?
5551800	5573080	528	A	1	I think I'm somewhat also slightly confused because in the Bayesian utility between the languages, comparing the languages as such in the Bayesian utility maximization, the exploration parts that are prioritized based on your X anti estimation on the value of information.
5574190	5593040	529	A	0.99438	Whereas I'm not sure that holds true for the active inference model as well, that the Epistemic exploration is prioritized or valued in terms of some of the same Pragmatic thing as well.
5596050	5600626	530	B	0.94021	You'll have a lot to explore and learn.
5600728	5607342	531	B	1	You can make a model that is 80 20 or 2080 or 100 and zero between Epistemic and Pragmatic.
5607486	5608306	532	B	0.99999	There's nothing we.
5608328	5619080	533	B	0.99999	Can say across generative models about whether active inference prioritizes epistem or not because you can make a model that's 100% or zero.
5619770	5628940	534	A	0.99991	Sorry, I meant more like does active inference allow us to talk about systems that the Beijing utility maximization doesn't allow us to talk about?
5629310	5632730	535	A	0.99273	I'm talking particularly about expressive power of the language.
5634910	5639546	536	A	0.90862	Are there things that the Bayesian utility maximization can talk about that active inference cannot?
5639578	5643066	537	A	0.761	Other things that active inference can talk about that Bayesian utility maximization cannot?
5643178	5644202	538	B	1	Two short answers.
5644266	5645440	539	B	1	One short answer.
5645970	5652660	540	B	0.99993	Utility maximization must cram epistemic value into Pragmatic value.
5653430	5662690	541	B	1	We gain more expressivity when we can articulate out Pragmatic value, which is the alignment of preferences with observations from epistemic value, which is information gain.
5662770	5664578	542	B	0.99984	So that's a huge articulation.
5664674	5675654	543	B	0.99	And the second thing is when you're in an anything maximization framework, when you're in a utility function now, again, begging the question how you constructed this function that you're trying to maximize.
5675782	5688430	544	B	0.79108	But when you're in a maximization framework, we have a well known set of approaches for finding local and global maxima using optimization or maximization frameworks.
5688930	5701898	545	B	0.99997	What active inference uniquely provides is it describes the path that that cognitive thing takes as a path of least action that minimizes surprise.
5702074	5707182	546	B	0.99914	So instead of climbing to the top of the hill up, are we on a foothill or are we on the biggest hill?
5707326	5712706	547	B	0.66731	We're like a ball rolling to the bottom of the hill, finding the least surprising path.
5712818	5724434	548	B	1	Now, that least surprising path can still include novelty and information gain, but it turns out to be a lot more tractable and connected with statistical physics and quantum mechanics.
5724562	5735610	549	B	0.99998	When we talk about the path of least action, ball rolling down the hill rather than this sort of question beg on top of a mountain climbing adventure Bayesian utility approach.
5738830	5741760	550	B	0.99999	But it's up to each person to feel how they want to feel.
5742130	5750900	551	C	0.99	Yeah, and I think that a little bit what's in the book as well, when you take the low and high road for free energy principle, right?
5751750	5765270	552	C	0.99999	Because how much you want to have your utility maximization function being disconnected to the pragma, to the action.
5767210	5771538	553	C	0.99999	Because when you're modeling behavior, it will be hard to do that independently.
5771634	5774502	554	C	0.58327	Like, you have a lot of you have way more assumptions.
5774566	5782460	555	C	1	You are committing to much a greater level of assumptions for your utility function if you don't do that.
5785010	5801522	556	C	0.99643	Because with the action first, that Pragmatizes, you have reasons to describe, have reasons to believe why that information gain works the way that it does, you can leverage some explanations on that.
5801656	5806382	557	C	0.99918	Without it, you have a model that has more assumptions.
5806446	5815542	558	C	1	And I think if you have a model with less assumptions, it's always healthier, let's say so, yeah.
5815596	5822178	559	A	0.99072	So I think that does talk about the comparative analysis of the expressivity.
5822274	5828170	560	A	0.99988	But I would also say as a metaphor that I'm not happy with either of those languages.
5829790	5835514	561	A	0.99	I suspect that both of those languages claim certain ontological assumptions.
5835562	5840480	562	A	1	And I'm always suspicious and wait, but where are these ontological assumptions coming from?
5841330	5842878	563	B	0.51	A few other points.
5843044	5854366	564	B	0.99997	We tap into an absolutely meaningful nexus of statistical methods and message passing schemes with active inference.
5854398	5863986	565	B	0.99997	If you can state something in the active inference ontology and construct a generative model then message passing algorithms can be deployed.
5864018	5866102	566	B	0.9732	That contractably compute that model.
5866156	5868130	567	B	0.99998	So that's absolutely nontrivial.
5868290	5872790	568	B	0.57783	Otherwise it's possible just to get wrapped up in some analytical formalism.
5873130	5880294	569	B	0.99992	But then once you want to do that on a 4K video now you're on square zero with the computer engineering.
5880342	5882026	570	B	0.99999	This is not that way.
5882208	5891886	571	B	0.89	And then I will respond to your metapoint with a metapoint, which is when we've enumerated the alternatives, the one that we like best.
5892068	5893758	572	B	0.99957	Personally, I feel happy with.
5893844	5896186	573	B	0.87502	I'm also open to new alternatives arising.
5896218	5903380	574	B	0.99999	But being unhappy when all things considered is in play, why?
5905270	5913890	575	C	0.834	What bothers you specifically on the ontology of the active imprint?
5915450	5935100	576	A	0.75	Yeah, I think I'm still looking for I don't know what exactly I'm looking for, but I feel dissatisfied with the account given for why helmet's free energy, least action thing like, is the central thing here or something.
5936290	5937310	577	A	0.99961	Why does it work?
5937380	5938750	578	A	0.99937	Why does this principle?
5939890	5940640	579	A	0.99	Yeah.
5943490	5946350	580	B	0.9999	There'S a lot of funny answers I could give there.
5946500	5960760	581	B	0.57	Yeah, that delta, that discrepancy, that's curiosity and that's the space of the open and that's learning and that's your unique contribution to make and that's everything.
5961130	5965270	582	B	0.99987	So that's not just a thorn in your shoe.
5965690	5974060	583	B	0.53566	That's like our experience of action amidst uncertainty, which is the water we're in.
5974590	5987406	584	B	1	And so whether we take a higher order narrative perspective on that discrepancy being dissatisfying or that discrepancy being satisfying, I think it's pretty I just need to.
5987428	5989214	585	A	0.99987	Minimize my surprise there.
5989412	5992990	586	B	1	Yeah, and you can choose to minimize your surprise through your attention.
5993410	5997822	587	B	1	You can choose to minimize surprise at a higher narrative order.
5997956	6006274	588	B	0.99921	Like, I am satisfied and complacent that I don't understand number theory but I use numbers to count objects around me.
6006472	6015350	589	B	0.99998	So that discrepancy and understanding knowing that there's 1000 years of research that could be done on numbers, it doesn't unsettle me.
6015500	6020162	590	B	0.99982	But for someone else that might be unsettling and that might lead them to ruminate.
6020226	6022926	591	B	1	It also might lead them to do a PhD in number theory.
6023058	6027690	592	B	0.99554	So just different paths for different individuals and contexts.
6028030	6031930	593	B	0.99982	But there's always so many technical and meta levels with active.
6035550	6050926	594	A	0.98663	So I don't want to keep you guys over time, but I would ask one last reference based thing, which is are there active inference accounts of seeing like, a state phenomena in any literature?
6051118	6055060	595	A	0.99	I think I heard you mention it once, so I was like, yeah, look at this.
6056630	6057426	596	B	1	Yeah.
6057608	6060514	597	B	1	Check out live stream 33 series.
6060562	6076874	598	B	0.99983	But also this course that we're literally actually enacting in with Avel is where these accounts come to roost and where we're creating a space to develop it.
6076912	6093710	599	B	1	And it's not a cathedral for us just to spectate at today, but if you want to make an active inference generative model of whatever social setting, when you have the model in hand, a lot of your questions will be sidestepped.
6095650	6099026	600	A	1	Okay, where is the 33 thing that you mentioned?
6099208	6113282	601	B	0.99997	If you go to the page with all of our Institute live streams and look in the Live Stream series, like the paper discussions in the 33 series, there's a dot zero video with background and context.
6113426	6116754	602	B	1	And then we have a dot one and a dot two conversation with the authors.
6116882	6135050	603	B	0.99817	But Avel, who's also the course coordinator for this course and research Avel's and colleagues work has heavily built on the seeing like a state, thinking like a state optimal grasp all these different topics.
6139580	6140952	604	A	0.62442	I'm on your YouTube channel.
6141006	6143930	605	A	0.98709	I'm slightly finding it hard to find the thing.
6146060	6157436	606	B	0.99987	If you look up Live Stream 33.0 or if you go to in the video description of any video where it says all live streams here, go there and search for but you'll find it.
6157458	6160588	607	B	1	And you can always email us or get in contact.
6160674	6176080	608	C	0.98108	But yeah, and I think a sales paper Thinking Like a State also can help you a lot to understand how active inference modeling is useful for the social sciences in comparison to other types of modeling.
6176160	6178768	609	C	0.99974	He makes a comprehensive description.
6178944	6179670	610	A	0.99965	Interesting.
6181560	6182710	611	A	0.99976	Great, thanks.
6183480	6188360	612	B	1	And this is our first iteration on this course.
6188430	6207150	613	B	0.99987	We are going to continue bringing new information to the table and supporting individuals who want to build generative models around this area, whether it's part of an internship program or part of a course credit or different kinds of programs that we'll be able to develop.
6208320	6215730	614	B	0.97952	But this is the real thing, and we're able to work with people who want to think and do.
6216980	6220092	615	B	0.94832	Makes sense indeed.
6220156	6222444	616	B	0.99994	Any closing thoughts, TJ?
6222572	6225030	617	B	1	Then I will go and then Lorena with the last word.
6226920	6228212	618	A	0.99349	No, this was great.
6228266	6229860	619	A	0.9414	Thanks for the conversation.
6231240	6231764	620	B	0.99961	Thank you.
6231802	6236836	621	B	0.99754	Well, thank you for Brennan TJ for joining Lorena for the lecture.
6236948	6239012	622	B	0.99976	This was a fun discussion.
6239076	6255256	623	B	0.99781	We never really know where how it's going to go, but I'm glad that we could cover so many of these topics and probably raise more questions and footholds than door slams.
6255288	6256780	624	B	0.99871	So thank you again, Lorena.
6257440	6260284	625	C	0.99	Yeah, thank you for inviting me.
6260322	6265904	626	C	0.98	And I think active inference holds a lot of space for experimenting as well.
6265942	6279170	627	C	0.99354	Some things you try to see if they make sense and if they're going to hold up and open new questions, and that might be an interesting aspect of the framework itself.
6281860	6282688	628	B	0.99971	Thank you, everybody.
6282774	6285468	629	B	0.99998	Thank you, everybody, for the great live chat comments.
6285564	6286936	630	B	0.97194	There's a lot there.
6286958	6288360	631	B	0.59	I couldn't read it all.
6288430	6290090	632	B	0.9997	So till next time.
6290540	6290900	633	C	0.98638	Bye.
