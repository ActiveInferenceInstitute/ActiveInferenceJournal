3330	3880	A	0.546256959438324	You.
6810	8120	B	0.872096598148346	Hello and welcome.
8650	11862	B	0.9174364805221558	It is September 12, 2023.
11996	26098	B	0.9132304787635803	We're here in the Active Inference for the Social Sciences course at the Active Inference Institute and having a discussion section on semiotics and semantics here with Lorena Ganzerla.
26274	29294	B	0.9777611494064331	We're going to be having a fun discussion, I hope.
29412	34458	B	0.7291085124015808	If you're watching Live, please feel free to write any questions in the Live chat.
34634	38682	B	0.7250155210494995	If you thought about joining and you weren't sure, it's not too late.
38826	46978	B	0.7753167748451233	Otherwise, we're going to pick up on some key points from the lecture and on the topic and see where we go.
47064	56200	B	0.8222917914390564	So, Lorena, welcome back and however you want to begin, let's go from there.
57450	58246	C	0.584351658821106	Okay.
58428	58918	C	0.5208580493927002	Hello.
59004	60710	C	0.8880262970924377	Thank you, Daniel.
62170	75978	C	0.871159553527832	So let's try to recap a little bit where we left off during the lecture just to remind us where we were.
76064	94866	C	0.562006950378418	Like, my point, what I was trying to articulate was the idea of what does it mean to talk about a formal semantics in a way that is not really loaded because it's an interesting thought.
95048	101314	C	0.8230551481246948	Like to have a semantics that is actually only formal, right?
101432	110214	C	0.8767150640487671	In principle, it would be relative to meaningful to meaning, right?
110412	120040	C	0.8045294284820557	In the notion that active inference is trying to cash it out.
124170	133630	C	0.8471574187278748	It's more like an idea or a way of modeling how we deal with meaningful situations.
134450	142530	C	0.7220140099525452	And to understand that in a more interesting, more embodied and more concrete way.
142600	166570	C	0.85112464427948	I was suggesting that we could use biosemiotics as a as a model and as a theory for living creatures like language users to navigate the realm of symbols.
168510	210550	C	0.5350817441940308	And gave one example which came from James Cott, which is the European forestry that comes with a practice understanding this scientific understanding of forests as a practice that allows us to refer to meaningful things in the environment in terms of what is valuable, what's interesting and what is not and interestingly, what is more important also from what becomes valuable.
211130	218754	C	0.7304496765136719	It is what is cropped out from the meaningful perspective.
218802	228098	C	0.7471920251846313	So things natural parts of nature becomes left out or understood as something that is not desirable.
228214	253960	C	0.5366372466087341	And you just understand what you don't want in your articulating principle as wheats or something that you should get rid of in respect to what is more desirable in terms of crops and how you understand nature in a more commoditized way.
260010	271690	C	0.7113261818885803	And I find, like this example from Scott kind of very elucidating in the book.
271760	281614	C	0.8818871974945068	He creates this in the book, he's talking about states how we articulate life around one specific notion of state.
281812	287434	C	0.768762469291687	But in this specific example, he has the idea of one official observer.
287562	338340	C	0.7040528655052185	And this official observer establishes a principle of meaning in a way, you have to have a handle of nature, and that also articulates how villages and how practices around agriculture and how people relate to each other within these practices gets organized specifically for one interesting point that he makes that is to appreciate the constriction of that is like a vision that notices not what within the meaningful crops, but which is left outside the field of vision.
341240	379010	C	0.8976976275444031	And I bring that specifically to understand how the fragility principle can or could be connected to a generalized synchronization over time in relation to those symbols and those practices in terms of niche construction and how this niche construction brings along with the symbolic use of language, predictive value.
386410	387206	B	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
387308	394710	B	0.5867694020271301	Brynn, want to bring up any thoughts on that or any other pieces or I'm happy to add a comment.
405120	413372	B	0.643727719783783	Brynn okay, guess not.
413426	414030	C	0.584351658821106	Okay.
417780	419104	B	0.7859137058258057	A lot to say there.
419222	422444	B	0.798943042755127	There was a little bit of a double play with what is cropped.
422572	431300	B	0.7465934157371521	On one hand, what is cropped is the industrial crop that is being prepared.
433640	436964	B	0.7500404715538025	And then the other side of that coin is what is cropped out.
437162	444088	B	0.495999813079834	And what we crop in is the part that we're paying attention to and we can't pay attention to everything.
444254	447364	B	0.7108061909675598	So it's like two sides of the same coin.
447492	457420	B	0.7229792475700378	What we pay attention to, what we include in attention in our cognitive awareness, leaves the shadow, which is what we exclude.
457920	462910	B	0.6889978647232056	And that could be like the weeds or the other ecosystem services.
463360	480016	B	0.8366997838020325	So by highlighting the meaning or one dimension of meaning or one stance on meaning, it's like a seesaw that becomes salient to the extent that something else must be deprioritized.
480208	484336	B	0.8480097055435181	So that's how we accentuate these distributions of meaning.
484528	493450	B	0.8882867693901062	And what do we get from active inference and free energy principle beyond, for example, what's provided in seeing like a state?
494540	496344	B	0.8365817666053772	I think there's a lot we could say on that.
496382	511224	B	0.8461179733276367	But one piece is we get a process theory, a real procedural approach to how different systems come to do sense making and cognition and action.
511352	535568	B	0.4856190085411072	So just describing the lay of the land or the history of forestry in Europe or any other state of affairs in the world, merely describing it may not even help us determine what's going to happen a short time later, let alone a long time later, or what might happen in a very different ecology.
535744	557848	B	0.830181896686554	Whereas if we understand the processes of sense making and decision making that different kinds of cognitive agents do, certainly humans also though states as cognitive entities, which is what seeing like a state or thinking like a state entails, we get a process based view on what otherwise might be merely descriptive.
557944	568210	B	0.6568859219551086	And along with that process based view, we gain an increased ability to make unique explanations, predictions, accounts, and so on.
570580	591032	C	0.8514240980148315	Yeah, we can also understand it in a different perspective in terms of realizing what becomes sensitized and what becomes desensitized along the process.
591086	598824	C	0.8200417160987854	So you can possibly model that using these kind of tools and understanding how that happens over time.
599022	609284	C	0.6323857307434082	I don't know how much in terms of prediction of things that were not foreseen in these descriptions, we can achieve.
609412	624172	C	0.556936502456665	In fact, you can achieve some level for sure, but that system should be decide how that delivers a very all encompassing prediction.
624316	626912	C	0.5931439995765686	In this case, I don't believe it can.
626966	627184	B	0.5664745569229126	Right.
627222	662590	C	0.6069321632385254	I don't think that's the purpose as well, but we can at least have which might not be as positive as we want, but I think we can understand how we can gain some understanding in this process of being more sensitive or less sensitive to specific primes and how these organizational principles, how powerful they become over time.
666060	673032	B	0.8855730295181274	Yeah, I'll read some comments in the chat and then Lorena or Brent feel free to just give any thoughts.
673096	676780	B	0.8394569754600525	Just upcycle club wrote hello.
676930	690320	B	0.9160832166671753	Biomimicry can enhance biosemiotics by showing us how nature solves problems and creates beauty through signs and codes and by encouraging us to apply these principles to our own creations.
692200	703972	C	0.5558115243911743	Yeah, the idea of coding is an interesting idea, but to talk about codes, I don't think that's my take.
704026	705510	C	0.8397994637489319	Right, I don't understand.
706360	714948	C	0.5268941521644592	We haven't coded any type of principles within our cognitive ability.
715044	735260	C	0.7430391907691956	But biologically speaking, however, you can understand these encodings in terms of becoming more or less sensitive over time to environmental cues as the example in terms of I use the example of forestry.
735340	736064	C	0.5664745569229126	Right.
736262	744900	C	0.7704457640647888	So in that specific case, what?
744970	752580	C	0.7624326944351196	You become more sensitive and the more you organize your life, or social life is organized around specific principles.
753240	785280	C	0.617236852645874	Then you can make sense of these relational stories instead of just leveraging one full difficult to explain notion of encoding in terms of social cognition because it will be hard to explain how the brain will be encoding these specific symbols, but they can be cashed out in the environment relationally in terms of those organizational principles.
786500	806010	C	0.7508191466331482	And then you have this idea of biomimicry like this reiterations and how that comes along to explain what this mimic or this meme will be then not so straightforward, I think.
807740	817392	B	0.5894339084625244	Well, certainly decompiling the source code of nature is somewhere between challenging and misguided or impossible.
817556	827096	B	0.8475562334060669	But that notion of a code script for biology has animated discussions of life, going back to, for example, Schrodinger's.
827128	827916	B	0.6575080752372742	What is life?
828018	831388	B	0.783736526966095	He basically says there's two aspects of living systems.
831484	845136	B	0.8562082052230835	There's their organizational capacity, their negantropic capacity, and then there's their code script, their Apyotic crystalline informational repository.
845328	855028	B	0.4908874034881592	And then another place that coding comes up a little bit less in the source code space is predictive coding.
855204	865556	B	0.6164582967758179	And that's in a way highly compatible with active inference and gives a deflationary account on how the semiotics are encoded.
865748	882290	B	0.5081678628921509	Rather than saying, well, this is what this variable in the source code means, or this is what this codes for, or here's a code switch, predictive coding is like saying we're not even going to touch the semantics of what the sign is itself.
882980	895552	B	0.8871325254440308	We're just going to hypothesize that the way that information about the sign is transferred is through this maximum information signaling approach called predictive coding.
895696	908632	B	0.6330179572105408	Because predictive coding arose out of video compression algorithms and only at the end of the 90s was found to be increasingly relevant for neural circuitry and so on.
908766	928110	B	0.5670268535614014	So it's another example of where like a process based approach ends up deflating or reframing the otherwise semantically loaded question.
929360	934370	B	0.7612059116363525	It's like switching out the question of where we're going to be with how we're going to get there.
934820	944076	B	0.6415841579437256	And instead of only focusing on the meaning of the signs first off, as if the meaning of the signs could be discussed outside of their implementation.
944268	951296	B	0.761113703250885	And then even if we could figure out what the signs were, we would then just turn around and want to know how they were transmitted.
951488	973020	B	0.8422414064407349	And so predictive coding or predictive processing in a way short circuits that or inverts it by first looking to explain how information is transmitted that could support semiotics and then in the context of biological systems we naturally have biosemiotics.
976630	983382	C	0.8101855516433716	Yeah, I would ask the question when you talk about information being transmitted right, what that actually means.
983436	998230	C	0.5075865387916565	And I think that's a very big topic and a very large discussion in terms of information theory when specifically applying that into biological systems.
998390	1011982	C	0.8062036037445068	I think there are some interesting people working on information that makes the case that Shannon has a point and he's really interested not in the semantics or in the meaning or anything else.
1012036	1015194	C	0.5512431859970093	He's kind of interested in the problem of transmission.
1015322	1034280	C	0.8682207465171814	And when you talk about transmission, it's worth to ask what is being transmitted exactly in the terms of signals, even if you're capturing specific patterns and you think that the pattern is the thing that will be transmitted in that sense.
1034810	1050300	C	0.8694955706596375	But that will be a worth asking question to understand this notion of what is actually being transmitted in that sense.
1051710	1068910	C	0.8300298452377319	This information theory is focusing on this notion of the problem of transmission and then all the concepts that come along to explain that in terms of uncertainty or noise and everything that impacts these transmissional processes.
1070790	1082582	C	0.566390335559845	And if you're saying like we're transmitting information in this sense that is breaking this semantic code apart yes it is.
1082636	1085734	C	0.7615141272544861	Because the problem is not focused on that.
1085852	1107040	C	0.64727783203125	It's that focusing on the specific correlations that we have that we call they were mentioning as information and how these correlations are an issue from the get go, from what is being picked up in one side being correlated to what comes into the other side.
1108530	1112000	C	0.6990302205085754	How do you lose or gain more information in that?
1113090	1130098	C	0.6310974359512329	But the deeper question here is how can you say that you are actually gaining or losing that information because you are defining this correlation that could be transmitted or not from the get go?
1130184	1136150	C	0.503976583480835	If you don't have that, you don't have anything being actually communicated.
1138010	1156038	C	0.8488370776176453	So with that in mind, you can explain these concepts in terms of function, and then there's a bunch of theories that navigate this sense of signaling that is specifically only functional.
1156134	1164900	C	0.7845547199249268	And then predictive coding tries to push that a little further, maybe.
1166150	1175474	C	0.7482386231422424	But then you have to explain in a deep sense how this information is being actually transmitted and processed.
1175522	1180920	C	0.518802285194397	And I don't think that is really as obvious and as clear as we think it is.
1184660	1211352	C	0.8668850064277649	Specifically when we're talking about this biological way of nature, navigating this signaling we have to talk about because the correlation, if it's defined abenishi from the beginning, then only have this kind of transmission for someone specific that can be able to understand that in the other side.
1211406	1212010	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
1215500	1237404	B	0.6693969368934631	Well, certainly whether we're talking about a chemical pheromone that requires some type of receptor or something more ephemeral like language that requires more of a semantic reference frame, there's no receiving the message without the sender.
1237452	1240610	B	0.7176302671432495	It's like they're kind of the two sides of the phone call.
1241220	1243840	B	0.9021452069282532	I'll ask a question from the chat?
1244900	1246240	B	0.7202980518341064	Love evolve.
1246760	1254020	B	0.8283629417419434	How about cultural encoding and principles in contrast to organizational?
1255000	1260840	B	0.8590905070304871	So how do we think about cultural meaning?
1262460	1266200	B	0.8443113565444946	And is that similar or different than organizational?
1269100	1270216	C	0.9213717579841614	That's a good point.
1270318	1270632	C	0.5664745569229126	Right.
1270686	1307860	C	0.7937383651733398	I think if you take very seriously the example from the forestry is a practice, then I think it has to be organizational in that sense, the meaning navigate this organizational practice, this organizational story that impacts not only communication between agents but also how the environment will be interpreted.
1311100	1315736	C	0.8906422257423401	In this sense, it will be transmitted and repeated over time because it has a history.
1315838	1323668	C	0.624463677406311	You cannot ignore the history of these practices being pushed further and replicated through generations.
1323764	1324504	C	0.5664745569229126	Right.
1324702	1358340	C	0.8832096457481384	So the way the villages will be organized in terms of that specific practice, for instance, can be understood in a meaningful and cultural way that organizes life in virtue of some specific principles that sensitizes our agents towards specific directions.
1360600	1374290	C	0.5190094113349915	And I think I don't know if you get my point.
1375780	1407246	C	0.9225095510482788	For instance, you can talk about, if you think about archaeological findings and how archaeological descriptions of specific villages and how they navigate this mapping out these archaeological sites.
1407358	1418470	C	0.881780207157135	They usually know exactly if you have some kind of history already from these communities, how that city will be likely to be organized.
1418890	1421354	C	0.6811242699623108	First off, where is the water?
1421472	1439306	C	0.8522694110870361	And if the water is in certain directions, probably there will be certain kinds of relationships with housing and communal housings and where they're going to place their dead in relation to this kind of specific organizational principle.
1439338	1444190	C	0.6165046691894531	The water is here, so plantations will be not so far away from that.
1444340	1457300	C	0.8243635296821594	And the city organizes like the village organizes a little bit in this sense and that builds up cultural practices, at least archaeologically, can be explained as such.
1460010	1471334	B	0.8691457509994507	I thought of something similar organization being the logistical or the operational structural aspects.
1471382	1481450	B	0.8888476490974426	So those would be the roads that connect the forestry outposts or the circulatory system that connects the different organs of organization.
1482030	1489470	B	0.7314059138298035	And then the culture is a cause and a consequence of organization.
1490530	1494314	B	0.6068142652511597	Organization is the enabling conditions for culture to arise.
1494362	1499486	B	0.8733744621276855	Okay, so given this road network, what cultures arise?
1499678	1502494	B	0.908309817314148	How similar or different are they convergently?
1502542	1508210	B	0.8488699197769165	What are their practices or their narratives that are shared amongst these different outposts?
1508870	1524730	B	0.8161432147026062	Or in the bodily example, okay, given the organization of the organs, literally the organizing process or principle, then what biosemiotics can arise with glucose and insulin and glucagon?
1525070	1536410	B	0.8855194449424744	And what culturally can arise, maybe even in terms of the generative model of encultured agents as a function of organization?
1536490	1543950	B	0.7313744425773621	And then what do those encultured agents do to the extent that they can modify organization?
1544370	1575850	B	0.5391684770584106	And so these kinds of unrolling cause and consequence relationships can be hard to disentangle because there's not like a clean single starting point that can be separated out or because it unfolds historically, it's not exactly a reaction in a test tube.
1577230	1584720	B	0.8976844549179077	So how does active inference give us an entry point into thinking about this?
1586210	1597522	C	0.6967885494232178	Yeah, that's one interesting thing about active inference that you don't really need an origin point, right?
1597576	1608760	C	0.6939969062805176	You can start modeling and start understanding that at any given point and build up from that story and see how it unfolds over time.
1610250	1627354	C	0.9451861381530762	I think that's the most beautiful idea, that you define your parameters and then you see from that parameters that can be arbitrarily defined and you can navigate how things change within those parameters in the generative model, right.
1627552	1644902	C	0.8815106749534607	When you have your dynamical systems, for instance, you have your state space, they have some specific range of defining parameters that set the limits of the possible states that you're going to navigate.
1645066	1673100	C	0.8613908886909485	And if you use this notion that these two densities brings about in terms of Bayesian modeling, you can use these kinds of tools to understand how from that specific parameters update what we narrate in active inference, as if belief updating can change over time in these terms.
1675470	1678314	B	0.9690910577774048	That's a very nice point.
1678432	1704526	B	0.7909101247787476	It reminds me of Bruno Latour's Actor Network Theory, or Ant, which kind of advocates a similar approach to what you described, which is like enter anywhere open mindedly, because in an Iterated modeling or Iterated analysis setting, the first proposal or the first trace detected, we know that's not the whole picture.
1704638	1706734	B	0.729070782661438	There may not be a whole or only picture.
1706782	1731142	B	0.5333428382873535	So we need to enter and iterate and then with active inference, specifically because of the compositionality that we get within a layer, collective behavior, and then also the kind of nesting smaller things inside of bigger things, we can always build something and then we can go, oh wow, it's like there's a lot of top down influence.
1731286	1744560	B	0.8075289726257324	Maybe there's a higher order factor or slower factor or a contextual factor we should consider or oh, we were abstracting across these smaller things inside.
1745030	1750180	B	0.7731584310531616	But for a later day or if relevant, we can dive in.
1750710	1761094	B	0.7892115116119385	And so then it allows a light hold or a grasp on the proposed generative model.
1761212	1763350	B	0.6213399171829224	Obviously, it's map, not territory.
1763690	1793760	B	0.5971547365188599	But even beyond that, we always know that we can expand laterally and across scales starting from anywhere in an Iterated modeling process without our first or even 11th model being proposed as, like, the accounts of some complex cultural phenomena which we're always going to only ever have our own perspectives on.
1794690	1800094	C	0.554279088973999	Yeah, I think you don't really find that in being so all encompassing.
1800142	1803060	C	0.7869452834129333	Like you have one model that will model them all.
1804790	1809640	C	0.7611379623413086	You can navigate those models in these more instrumental terms.
1810250	1849036	C	0.7410381436347961	It raises different questions when you put things like that in terms of geontology of models and models and theories and sciences, but they can be also described as tools for describe tools for grasping and describing phenomena in a more non committal way, how much that how much that smuggles in philosophical or moral ontological problems.
1849138	1860204	C	0.8479408025741577	It is still, I think, under debate, but it is still told.
1860242	1876512	C	0.6486895680427551	You bring insights to think about specific cultural collective phenomena, which is not it's complicated because I think what I'm getting at, I'm kind of like going back and forth.
1876576	1898780	C	0.8362936973571777	But when you talk about social sciences and modeling, usually you have ways of modeling modeling agents or ways of modeling collectives and active inferences, trying to come up with a modeling in which you can understand agency and collectives within the same modeling schema.
1899520	1935708	C	0.7749308347702026	And I think specifically for these cases, if you're interested in understanding types of cultural phenomena among language users in specific contexts, you can at least partially understand or gain some insight in this agent collective relationship that is a little bit more interesting than we have found so far in the social sciences, because you can have our specific understandings of memes.
1935824	1937368	C	0.7155911326408386	But then how the agent?
1937534	1939576	C	0.6839586496353149	Where is the agency in that?
1939758	1948716	C	0.544679582118988	You lose a little bit of agency when you're trying to understand only agents.
1948818	1970240	C	0.7257134914398193	Then you don't know how that kind of scales up because active inference tries and offers these scale free modeling tools that facilitate this conversion into agents and collectives.
1971400	1983620	C	0.8722420334815979	I would be interested in asking you, actually, how do you navigate that when you talk about social phenomena in ants or termites?
1987870	1999870	C	0.7217776775360107	Because then you have very specific coding demarcations, I guess, for these social environments.
2002900	2005344	B	0.8622873425483704	Yeah, it's a great question.
2005462	2015120	B	0.6245232224464417	It's also whether it's an open wound or a dirty closet that's just shut.
2015280	2020390	B	0.6983842849731445	There's actually a lot of ambiguity and unresolved tension around.
2020760	2023828	B	0.778221845626831	Well, is the ant colony social?
2023914	2030200	B	0.8512955904006958	Are they social insects that reifies the nest mate as the individual?
2030350	2033624	B	0.8423048257827759	And then what they're doing is like when we hang out and talk.
2033822	2038200	B	0.8725565671920776	So reifying the nest mate as individual makes the colony social.
2038350	2051036	B	0.5319275259971619	But if the colony is individual, then what nest mates are doing with each other is not social any more than we would describe the liver and the kidney as having like a social single cellular interaction.
2051068	2052930	B	0.536873459815979	But we know that would be missing the point.
2054340	2065456	B	0.7720810174942017	And so there definitely is attention with some of these evolutionary lineages, like ants being monophyletically obligate usocial all.
2065558	2070704	B	0.6064066886901855	And only ants are eusocial they all live in the colonies.
2070752	2088040	B	0.619300365447998	There's no free living nest mate whereas other parts of the evolutionary tree there are life histories that do look a little bit more like social collaboration that can then dissolve.
2088800	2096590	B	0.8425877094268799	And so knowing what level of lock in makes something social.
2097600	2099240	B	0.8410573601722717	When are we socializing?
2099400	2103184	B	0.7476801872253418	And what level of lock in goes beyond social.
2103302	2131050	B	0.49004825949668884	And it kind of like makes when the blanket is so strong around the social that like for multicellularity that it's kind of losing the social feature again because if we just use social to mean the connective tissue or the kind of lubricant or the spaces between everything, then it means nothing.
2131900	2139950	B	0.742415726184845	So a real tension is what space does the social account for?
2141600	2147820	B	0.5676636099815369	And is this going to be a concept with a lot of creep looking?
2147890	2158284	B	0.809647262096405	Well, it's a social relationship between the roots of the tree and the fungus and it's a social relationship amongst the molecules in the test tube.
2158332	2161120	B	0.5773608088493347	Is that too broad of a social conception?
2162280	2170340	B	0.6613320112228394	Are there downsides or are there trade offs associated with a broader social concept?
2171080	2173476	B	0.539912223815918	Do we dilute what the social means?
2173578	2182730	B	0.7192939519882202	And then on the other side, might we exclude phenomena that could importantly be considered social?
2184060	2186856	B	0.4826206862926483	Well, that's not social, they're just talking on a train.
2187038	2188844	B	0.7438700199127197	It's like well that's the other side.
2188962	2199470	B	0.9089581966400146	If we were to have carving out encounters that we do want to include as a social and is there a true social?
2200500	2206720	B	0.8816415071487427	Does active inference help us sidestep or at least negotiate this territory?
2208260	2236040	B	0.8121402263641357	Because we could develop a generative model or an ecosystem of shared intelligence with one person and two internet of things devices and a bird and a metronome and just say we made what we made and then leave it as a second order interpretation whether that is a social setting.
2239420	2246124	C	0.8631976246833801	I mean, I think you are pointing at the granularity of those scales, right?
2246162	2259010	C	0.767845094203949	If you have a model that one to one to everything that you already have, it's probably not interesting and not informative because you cannot define those limits of what you're trying to understand.
2260260	2275030	C	0.7546784281730652	And in the other hand, when you do that, when you define those limits, if you're too narrow or you're going to leave out you're going to idealize also in a way, right, and leave out many other parts of the system that you're interested in.
2275800	2296190	C	0.6622282266616821	But if you don't do that, if you don't make this decision, if you don't make this decision when modeling anything then how you can have any access to the phenomena, right?
2296880	2306076	B	0.8658788204193115	And to connect this to the forestry so in the forestry example, the desirada was lumber.
2306268	2315888	B	0.6124134659767151	Now that may have been a very narrowly scoped desire, but it's a relevant thing to want this resource.
2316064	2333850	B	0.8400262594223022	And then industrialization science as a process professionalization those allowed the description and the handling and ultimately the kind of top down legibility and control thinking like a forestry company.
2334380	2340792	B	0.8887603282928467	Now with respect to the social sciences by analogy to forestry science.
2340936	2364544	B	0.8108727335929871	So now we're entering an era of increased legibility and control of social systems and human natural capital and attention as a resource, trust as a resource in a way is being cropped analogous to produce the content of lumber.
2364592	2366704	B	0.7372785806655884	But now there are social contents.
2366752	2374390	B	0.7012500166893005	So as the social goes from being just only simply the water we swim in.
2374840	2389304	B	0.5933186411857605	Not something that's even compared counterfactually to alternative cultural possibilities per se, but falls under the scope of the professional management.
2389352	2392776	B	0.7689746618270874	Like forestry then that's.
2392808	2417270	B	0.7896953225135803	When this discussion of, well, what's the lumber and what is the weeds that are being pruned and what ecosystem services, when we pay attention to certain parts of human social culture, and when we seek to make more of this kind of lumber, what else does that come along with?
2418600	2423510	B	0.7400991320610046	And what decisions come into play.
2425320	2428630	C	0.8404630422592163	That comes along when you see the process?
2458220	2459252	C	0.8078122138977051	Or Instagram?
2459316	2459784	C	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
2459822	2460244	C	0.7551714777946472	Twitter?
2460292	2462860	C	0.5388986468315125	After what happened to Twitter.
2467200	2476370	C	0.7766602635383606	But yeah, in terms of attention pruning, you do have that very effectively already happening.
2477220	2483680	C	0.7624463438987732	You can see how that happens efficiently in the voting elections for instance.
2484020	2496790	C	0.522973895072937	It can be very easily manipulated and we saw what happened in elections for instance in Brazil or in the well all over.
2501720	2530000	C	0.5333187580108643	You navigate a system of attention organization that selects in only what he thinks that your interested in, in the effect of that in terms of decision making and in terms of trust, in terms of diversity of discourse, we have seen that it can be devastating.
2532980	2547940	C	0.7401021718978882	The question would be like how can you use active inference and these tools that we have to make this kind of technology a little bit more inclusive without being super, also disruptive?
2549180	2557688	C	0.7443819642066956	Is it even like a possibility?
2557864	2558844	C	0.5272911190986633	I really don't know.
2558882	2567890	C	0.6745179295539856	I think it's an ethical problem that we have when we talk about social systems and these principles of attention exclusion, leaving things out.
2576380	2578810	B	0.69578617811203	Lot to say on that.
2579820	2601532	B	0.7863490581512451	With modeling and interpolating and models, whether it's large language model type or linear regression type, it is able to interpolate to put data points within an enclosure of what has already been described.
2601676	2608050	B	0.7434679269790649	And Bayesian statistics and other types of prediction algorithms are not immune to that either.
2608420	2618070	B	0.6927134990692139	If we have some prior distribution belief, we believe it's possible for it to be between 20 and 30 degrees outside.
2619400	2629220	B	0.604961633682251	Then when we get data inside of our bounds we can converge and that actually tightens our beliefs.
2629380	2631224	B	0.5284220576286316	Not always a bad thing of course.
2631422	2639672	B	0.8140488862991333	And then outside of the scope of the possible, those data are just seen as noise and they may not even be integrated.
2639736	2659680	B	0.4897146224975586	So then that can lead to a reinforcing process, not necessarily an adaptive one either, where information that's confirmatory is used to ratchet and increase precision and then information that is not confirmatory is discarded as not useful.
2663680	2673680	C	0.5407131314277649	In this case it doesn't even enter the landscape of attention of the user.
2681330	2710970	C	0.6565595269203186	What I was thinking in relation to this idea of forestry is because we have now organizational principles that are faster and more populated with information and attention grabbing kinds of prompts.
2712670	2734990	C	0.6405932903289795	We transform the same we transform the same principle into a harder to grasp process.
2736160	2737816	C	0.7325811386108398	It becomes more complex.
2737928	2747500	C	0.5802098512649536	It becomes harder to describe the process of understanding that in terms of forestry is kind of way more grounded.
2747660	2772632	C	0.6106534004211426	When you apply that socially to this kind of environment that we're talking like internet or this highly volatile and virtual in principle environment, it becomes much harder to assess what is being pruned out or not.
2772766	2773800	C	0.48941436409950256	You just don't know.
2773870	2779252	C	0.5371094942092896	It makes it more clear that there is a process of pruning.
2779316	2782750	C	0.4918277859687805	You need to have no control of what is being taken out.
2783120	2790220	C	0.5206955075263977	You have no idea what's being left away from your perspective of attention.
2792720	2803580	B	0.6888649463653564	So to this topic of intended or unintended semantic pruning, I think this has helped me identify attention.
2803660	2820656	B	0.895144522190094	If we want to talk about the semantics or semiotics biosomiotics, whatever we want to call it, of the letter E in relationship to letter A, we're looking for an account that might convey leterness.
2820848	2824980	B	0.7347070574760437	But we're generalized above enis or anus.
2825560	2839420	B	0.4923366904258728	So in some ways we've erased or abstracted generalized away from the particulars of the sign meaning by taking a semiotic perspective.
2841440	2853680	B	0.8079571723937988	And so it's like we got into the game to have a semantic account of biological phenomena or of any phenomena for a biological entity.
2854580	2870688	B	0.6725580096244812	Yet this process in a sense distances us from the particulars that actually do grant it that meaning in the actuality.
2870864	2883070	B	0.786518394947052	Like if we walk into a sacred space and it's like oh well, that is just doing that over there and this architecture is doing this and because of the layout people must use the room this way.
2884720	2899600	B	0.5545114874839783	That's removed from the actual meaning which is the cause and consequence with the organization and culture that we discussed.
2900740	2920840	B	0.7220790982246399	But that prima fascia account doesn't generalize yet any generalization that we make so that we can talk about multiple places or multiple letters on a common accounting framework is going to remove those particularities.
2923820	2927416	B	0.5675433278083801	So it's a very challenging catch 22.
2927598	2949810	B	0.6957693099975586	Whether we want to really account for the N equals one and maybe even live and act and play and work in the N equals one versus develop something that might be satisfying and cut and dry, but it's always going to be on the sidelines with respect to what it actually means.
2952420	2954530	C	0.7412887811660767	But what do you mean?
2955140	2957680	C	0.8284955620765686	I don't understand what you're getting at.
2957750	2961776	C	0.754150390625	Is it you mean it's generalized or not generalized?
2961888	2963430	C	0.6679768562316895	I didn't get that.
2964760	2978090	B	0.7536537051200867	When we generalize, when we ask what words mean, what words mean beyond any given word, we've lost touch with what any given word means.
2980300	2984910	B	0.7616521120071411	But words are what they actually mean in a situation.
2986400	3002544	B	0.8547638654708862	So it's just in this scientific approach to meaning semiotics and semantics we have these two tensions or a tension to.
3002582	3039980	B	0.6853422522544861	Reconcile between actually giving an account of the meaningfulness of the specific thing versus taking a more scientific approach, which would be gathering a group of similar things and finding their shared attributes, which out of necessity must abstract, must crop out features that are empirically or anecdotally taken to not matter.
3040130	3044060	B	0.903902530670166	Like, we abstract whether it was a Monday or Tuesday that we did the experiment.
3044560	3049040	B	0.7019522786140442	We just combine all of our replicates together when we do the scientific analysis.
3054380	3059556	C	0.5262253880500793	You mean if you generalize the practice, you lose what you've been?
3059678	3071384	C	0.8239408731460571	If you generalize it too much, you lose everything that's meaningful to you in terms of, like you formalize it and then you have an empty semantics.
3071432	3078940	C	0.6493710875511169	You have a semantics with no meaning that can only be meaningful in terms of how you apply that in terms of specific practices.
3079100	3085856	B	0.8023704290390015	Yeah, it's like I have a framework for the formal meaning of letters within words, within sentences, within paragraphs.
3085888	3088128	B	0.6469321846961975	And then it's like, well, but now what's?
3088144	3091670	B	0.8617445826530457	Your next N equals one word that you're actually going to bring?
3093880	3101880	B	0.6049942374229431	It's not just about building some abstract scaffold for bigger and bigger boulders of meaning.
3102540	3122510	B	0.7180150151252747	At some point, through our embodied thought and action in our experience, it is going to come down into the particulars, and it doesn't immediately seem clear that simply generalizing further brings us there.
3123940	3130540	C	0.6156651973724365	Yeah, I don't really believe you can have that kind of generalization.
3130620	3140080	C	0.6598684787750244	I think we attempt to build whatever what I see that's the interesting aspect of the formal thematics.
3140160	3158772	C	0.7590973377227783	You try to build this more general understanding that just formalizes to model, but for that to be meaningful, it has to be embedded in a way of practicing it, like in a forestry practice.
3158836	3173330	C	0.864745557308197	It has to be embedded in a cultural environment in which that can be actually observed in terms of what happens when a generative model is being updated or not.
3175540	3176496	C	0.7727858424186707	Is that what you mean?
3176518	3185344	C	0.7005051374435425	Because otherwise I don't really understand how it becomes too formal.
3185392	3190950	C	0.8832098841667175	It becomes too abstract in terms of some I would not understand what that is.
3195780	3199212	B	0.897672712802887	I'll think a little more Brynn or TJ.
3199356	3203990	B	0.8895975947380066	Do you want to add any thoughts or questions?
3205960	3207028	A	0.6354976296424866	Yeah, sorry.
3207194	3209904	A	0.6377973556518555	I think I don't have a lot of context.
3209952	3215400	A	0.5443046689033508	I've been following some of the discussion but not attended a lot of these calls.
3215820	3216810	B	0.5825141668319702	It's all.
3220460	3221704	A	0.5627530217170715	Yeah, I don't know.
3221822	3247824	A	0.6970977187156677	I think I'm, in general, just sort of interested in trying to understand the relationship between sorts of constructionist epistemologies and generative models and active inference style stuff and how active inference style, like yeah.
3247862	3253488	A	0.9102211594581604	What are the philosophical commitments that active inference involves with respect to knowledge and epistemology?
3253584	3267290	A	0.7555326223373413	And there's a sense in which rational choice models often assume a certain sort of objectivity to beliefs and then desires are where most of the degrees of freedom lie or something.
3268220	3284588	A	0.5697449445724487	Whereas there's a lot of issue, like there's a lot of things that come up once you start talking about reflexivities where concepts themselves become self fulfilling prophecies, what your beliefs about society ends up shaping the society itself.
3284674	3291504	A	0.8886045217514038	So there's a sense in which there's this codependence between the object of knowledge and knowledge about that object itself.
3291622	3303750	A	0.5506277084350586	And I think yeah, I'm sort of interested in how the active entrance ways of thinking about this offers what perspectives on those questions and stuff like that.
3307400	3308148	B	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
3308234	3309910	B	0.7468470931053162	Great questions.
3312380	3334530	C	0.8729101419448853	So when you talk about the object of knowledge and the knowledge itself and active inference, I think you can think of in terms of this.
3338150	3340674	C	0.7963303923606873	Well, there's a few ways to think about that.
3340712	3353858	C	0.835198700428009	I guess the knowledge itself has to come epistemically from where your agent is actually embedded and situated.
3353954	3357046	C	0.8411166667938232	Specifically in active inference, it's embodied.
3357238	3360300	C	0.7753607034683228	It kind of needs to have a model.
3361550	3376602	C	0.8121461272239685	The model is modeling a body is modeling a body that is in the world and it's all the time situated, is never disconnected to its environment and the history of that environment.
3376666	3378320	C	0.6106663346290588	Right, yeah.
3381270	3401830	C	0.5737246870994568	But if you think if you push that to the object of that knowledge, I don't know how different that will how different how can you differentiate that so sharply when you talk about active imprints?
3403050	3425390	C	0.866027295589447	Because if you think of in terms of a generative model, what will be updated is updated from a prior that is always directed in this body, in this situated realm.
3426290	3446310	C	0.6323591470718384	So they sort of conflated as I see, maybe I'm mistaken, but they sort of conflate in how you're going to update your generative model, which would be at the same time what you know and what the object of this knowledge?
3448570	3452294	A	0.6623174548149109	Sorry, if I can just raise a question to that.
3452412	3479086	A	0.8769574165344238	Yeah, so I think that there is a sense in which with respect to something that in epistemology would be called self knowledge, there is a question here that the active inference agent has this model that is situated in the body or in its structure and is also modeling that structure itself.
3479188	3491490	A	0.8209370970726013	And there is this issue of the belief is not unidirectionally dependent on the object sort of a thing, but has this feedback loop thing comes up there.
3491640	3503974	A	0.8236153721809387	But there's another way in which I think where this sort of thing comes, where even if the object is outside of the body of the knowledge, I think that could still come up.
3504012	3537682	A	0.8002641201019287	So, for instance, if an active inference agent lives in a society of other active inference agents, where currently all of them defect on prisoners dilemma, but maybe on further reflection, they would want to again, I don't know what further reflection would mean in the active inference sense, but I'm just saying in the intuitive sense, what would it mean for them to go from one fixed point to another fixed point where they're all cooperating or something like that?
3537736	3541714	A	0.5528042912483215	And that, I think, is not clear to me.
3541752	3570730	A	0.8691117763519287	Like how that shift can happen in active inference where it's not just purely using the empirical information to keep running the mill of your free energy equation but also recognizing the contingencies and then identifying those contingencies to make something like shifts from one state to another.
3570880	3580938	A	0.8276277184486389	Like if I model that the society is a cruel space and if everyone models a society as a cruel space, then we will end up creating a society that is a cruel space.
3581124	3602790	A	0.4928167164325714	But if only we could recognize that our belief or our model that society is a cool space is a contingent belief and we could all somehow negotiate or communicate and shift to a different belief about what society is and society is a kind place, then we will end up creating that kinder society or something.
3602940	3609546	A	0.7305181622505188	And that sort of like a belief about the thing that society is.
3609728	3612140	A	0.7808387875556946	It's not entirely within the agent.
3614910	3616966	A	0.49232423305511475	It has a weird intersubjective character.
3616998	3623422	A	0.8498424887657166	So it's not entirely outside of the agent either, but it's not entirely internal to the agent either.
3623476	3624240	A	0.6280289888381958	Or something.
3624930	3625680	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3628290	3630974	C	0.7568970322608948	You can think of that like you're talking about active inference.
3631022	3633060	C	0.751629650592804	Action comes first, right?
3634230	3642734	C	0.5345256328582764	You don't have the knowledge inside your head waiting for you to push that out of the action has to come first.
3642872	3652194	C	0.8613941669464111	So if you take that as a principle, an organizing principle, it depends on the contingency of your actions.
3652322	3660326	C	0.6814900040626526	The possibilities might be limited by your situated condition, but they are limited.
3660438	3667994	C	0.7623361945152283	It doesn't mean that you don't have a range of options from that state space in which you can navigate.
3668042	3677950	C	0.8078076839447021	So you can navigate it for the good or for the bad, but it starts with the action perception loop, starts with the action.
3680070	3680546	A	0.6215529441833496	All out.
3680568	3682274	B	0.8140645623207092	A few other pieces on that.
3682472	3684610	B	0.8619070649147034	TJ very good point.
3684680	3697558	B	0.8648728728294373	Like when we see the pragmatic component of action as self fulfilling epistemic component of action having to do with gaining knowledge and the salience of information.
3697644	3703106	B	0.7477310299873352	But the pragmatic component is about bringing our observations into alignment with our preferences.
3703298	3706726	B	0.847555935382843	And then you identified two related settings.
3706838	3717034	B	0.8554624915122986	One of them is like pure intra subjectivity like I expect myself or I find myself or I habitually think about x.
3717232	3724510	B	0.5860381722450256	Well, that's kind of a trivial self fulfillment because thinking about something is its own fulfillment.
3725010	3738546	B	0.7592711448669434	And then when we're in this second person or social space we can agree on little performance art or on a game and games give evidence to that.
3738728	3759990	B	0.8496227860450745	That when people are able to perform communication or message passing such that new expectations or preferences are set whether more top down, like more seeing, like a state or more laterally, more like collective behavior then those regimes can be embodied.
3760150	3768998	B	0.6535274386405945	And then you brought up a very important point about the awareness of the contingencies or awarenesses of adjacent possibles or of counterfactuals.
3769174	3782450	B	0.6579010486602783	So the body might be we could model its morphology as doing some computation but that doesn't mean that the morphology has an awareness or can explore a counterfactual.
3783030	3790434	B	0.8065181970596313	Like bodies are not always exploring every counterfactual because Skin is in the game.
3790552	3808614	B	0.6527733206748962	But again, mentally it's very cheap and easy to consider counterfactuals and situational awareness of social settings, especially if it can be not just understood but communicated, opens up a space where we're all playing Prisoners Dilemma.
3808662	3818734	B	0.9019566178321838	Now there's parameterizations of Prisoners multi agent Prisoners Dilemma where tragically, we just all defect all day and never learn.
3818932	3824350	B	0.6455536484718323	There's also parameterizations where you just start all cooperating and never defect.
3824690	3836530	B	0.6828716397285461	And then the interesting settings are where there might be like phase transitions or where a perturbation moves the system from one attractor into another attractor.
3837190	3850870	B	0.49210795760154724	So there's just a lot of richness and that's the work of building generative models and that iterated modeling process to unpack and refine.
3851930	3857206	B	0.5696722269058228	And active inference isn't going to have a stance on a Prisoner's dilemma.
3857398	3867130	B	0.6247003078460693	We can use active inference to describe the prisoner's dilemma, but active inference isn't going to come down on literally even a little two by two game theory matrix.
3867490	3882770	B	0.6244752407073975	So we can then extrapolate that active inference is not going to come down with an opinion on something significantly more rich and real than a two by two game theory matrix.
3883350	3892770	B	0.861931324005127	And so that work is what people enact in applying active inference.
3897410	3897966	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3898068	3924120	A	0.7571684122085571	And I think my question is something like but insofar as humans try to constantly improve their social games, how can we model that sort of a prior over your actions or policies that enables that sort of progressive, um, improvements or something?
3925290	3931670	C	0.6474145650863647	Well, we are assuming that we're trying to improve.
3932090	3935450	C	0.7394511699676514	We don't know that, but you can model them as improving.
3935790	3947520	C	0.8873631954193115	But like following Daniel's lead, we're talking about these specific games and contingencies these transitions from one state to another.
3948290	3959074	C	0.7427793145179749	Specifically, if you're talking about this modeling of social actors and talking about several actors, if your model involves several of them, will not be really linear, right?
3959112	3975762	C	0.6880189776420593	You don't have like an easy, smooth transition of improvement you can capture over time as modeling how they might tend to go towards a direction and understand that as improvement.
3975826	3983094	C	0.6470831632614136	But that takes specific iterations that will not be fully linear.
3983142	3997070	C	0.6738776564598083	I guess specifically if you want to understand Error and improvement instead of Trier and Error but trier and adding up into this Error like Error improvement.
3997810	4013300	C	0.5133451223373413	But when you're modeling specifically with dynamical systems, for instance, you're not going to see a full linear story and I don't think you're going to see that if you're modeling using active inference and multiple agents.
4016310	4017762	B	0.7766791582107544	I'll add one piece there.
4017816	4046442	B	0.8596075773239136	So how could we go about modeling multiscale social goals so we could think about different citizens in a region and the modeler is going to choose what knowledge to realize in the generative model, like what you put into the calculator it's going to calculate upon.
4046586	4065490	B	0.7013283967971802	Now this happens to be an elaborate stochastic method, but if we only tell people, yeah, there's just your personal income optimize for that, your preference is to have that be higher, well, then the simulation is going to unfold a certain way.
4065640	4079778	B	0.890681803226471	If we say, well, there's your personal financial income and then there's your city and then there's your region, then that opens up through different mechanisms.
4079954	4089978	B	0.7096203565597534	Maybe an individual goes flat or neutral on the personal in service of a larger win at a higher level.
4090144	4096346	B	0.7492316961288452	Well now what if the modeler says it's not just about the financial income now we're also going to have this secondary criterion?
4096538	4104110	B	0.8780016899108887	Well now different agents could attend differently to those two different outcome variables.
4104610	4112900	B	0.4891923666000366	And maybe there's one simulation where 50% only care about this and 50% care about that and it works perfect or it doesn't work.
4114950	4132390	B	0.8067991137504578	It's like a broad surveying or Lego set or grammar or active inference ontology for scoping very broadly and very inclusively.
4133390	4150206	B	0.6653465628623962	But all the work is in the real simulation development and sweeping because very little could be said about a game theory game.
4150308	4164994	B	0.5108135342597961	If you didn't know what the parameters were in the matrix, you wouldn't know whether this Prisoner's Dilemma was going to be like an always cooperate or which agents with which strategies would or wouldn't cooperate if you don't know what the matrix looks like.
4165192	4178600	B	0.8520541787147522	So before the values have kind of been filled in, it's just like actually describing the adjacencies and the counterfactuals and the contingencies of our scientific model.
4180810	4185000	B	0.840130090713501	But that's still prior to having the model in hand.
4186730	4193786	B	0.5928592681884766	So now we're looking at that tree in the European forest and it's like, well, if I had this tool, then I could cut it down this way.
4193808	4196382	B	0.7883416414260864	If I had this tool, I could cut it down this way or I could wait.
4196436	4198910	B	0.6622333526611328	It's like that's.
4200450	4204030	B	0.8597092628479004	Alternative actions about that tree.
4204370	4214850	B	0.8368045091629028	Now in the social science setting, discussion of different scientific methodologies are like counterfactuals about that social tree.
4226650	4227158	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4227244	4260670	C	0.8659013509750366	And specifically, if you're navigating these kinds of game theoretical models, if that's what you're interested in, you can even define in terms of prisoners dilemma, for instance, specific values to see what happens when everybody deflects and how frequent modulate those frequencies in terms of specific in multiple iterations.
4262610	4269742	C	0.8161282539367676	How are you going to build up the weight for the tendency of deflecting?
4269806	4288570	C	0.7661756277084351	Again, if your neighbor deflected once and deflected twice or three times and see how that will accommodate over time how many times this agent will change its behavior until it stops changing the behavior.
4289710	4314722	C	0.6900540590286255	But you don't really again, you might use a Bayesian understanding Bayesian model for that, but it not necessarily explain it does not necessarily explain the action fully.
4314866	4321830	C	0.7448592782020569	I mean, socially you're modeling only the interest of that specific actor.
4326090	4330060	A	0.8979976177215576	I have a slightly meta question, if I can ask both of you.
4330510	4333420	A	0.5523093938827515	I'm not sure how these calls usually go.
4334190	4338170	A	0.8470104932785034	I'm curious what are your interests in active inference?
4338850	4347920	A	0.9022018909454346	What brings you to active inference and what do you think active inference adds to our theoretical understanding and in what ways or something.
4349890	4352260	B	0.6572411060333252	Lorena, go for it.
4353990	4377770	C	0.8591461777687073	Well, I think I was trying to touch upon that before and how we can, if you're navigating, for instance, behavior in terms of game theory, this kind of modeling, if you're talking about like trust games, for instance, you're going to understand how these two addict interactions evolve over time, specifically over interactions.
4378190	4390726	C	0.4958910346031189	But you don't have an account of change because you have very limited options of actions, and you don't have an account also on scales.
4390758	4414194	C	0.5245035290718079	And I think active influence tries to edge a little bit an account on how you can scale that and how you can add more parameters into the game and see how they evolve with a more clear understanding, some richer understanding.
4414242	4417830	C	0.8877568244934082	That, for instance, when you talk about specific interactions in game theory.
4419770	4426670	C	0.8339826464653015	So that's one aspect that active inference kind of contributes.
4426850	4457042	C	0.8463059067726135	Another point is because we have this parameterization that is specifically in terms of belief updating and also in terms of dynamics, we are always talking about agents that will be situated and embodied and have a very specific synchronization with the environment all the time.
4457096	4461778	C	0.7653446793556213	Because when you talk about active inference, the action comes always first.
4461944	4466200	C	0.8060213327407837	So you try to have a less reductive model.
4468490	4475298	C	0.7153222560882568	And when you want to model cultural agents and collective action, I think that's kind of desirable.
4475394	4476920	C	0.7109020948410034	That's what you're looking for.
4478510	4480540	A	0.8917422890663147	Is it also your area of interest?
4481150	4481898	C	0.5276400446891785	Sorry?
4482064	4483980	A	0.850616991519928	Is it also your area of interest.
4487740	4490072	B	0.9021134972572327	Mine or is that Lorena's area of interest?
4490126	4494280	A	0.8030740022659302	Lorena's, what do you sorry.
4494350	4498264	A	0.877402663230896	Like, my question was also like, what brings you to active inference?
4498312	4508188	A	0.7056210041046143	And I think you answered a lot of ways in which active inference adds theoretical value, but I wasn't sure if that was also your subjective interest or motivation.
4508284	4509728	C	0.7950232028961182	It's my subjective interest.
4509894	4510608	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4510774	4512832	C	0.7792739272117615	I'm curious to see how that pans out.
4512886	4513344	C	0.5664745569229126	Right.
4513462	4531370	C	0.7379613518714905	I'm interested in how that helps us to think of this type of phenomena, and I'm very interested in how this relationship from agents to collectives and back again work.
4535980	4558448	C	0.8398452401161194	And I think it might give us some well, you give us some very insightful way of modeling these relationships and navigating it as you want, because this feature of being scale free is kind of helpful to looking things.
4558614	4567010	C	0.8726539611816406	You can define your Markov blanket in terms of are you interested and see what happens.
4571830	4572706	C	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
4572808	4579330	B	0.7879026532173157	Yeah, I'll just give a few thoughts, even though also, surely some of these thoughts are scattered.
4580550	4587160	B	0.9109973907470703	You asked TJ, what does active inference add to our theoretical account of the social?
4587850	4596230	B	0.8340842723846436	It does many things, in my view, and that's what makes it so valuable epistemically and pragmatically.
4596390	4605846	B	0.6928868889808655	It gives us the expressivity within a scale to describe collective behavior and across scales to describe nested systems.
4605958	4618414	B	0.6854017972946167	So that brings continuity to discussions of the social with broader discussions of the biological, ecological, computational, physical, and so on.
4618532	4622210	B	0.8685104250907898	So that's a multiscaled transdisciplinary element.
4622550	4646794	B	0.8011559844017029	Active inference provides us with legible first principles which can either be taken instrumentally as just heuristics and also in certain situations can be viewed empirically as justifiable first principles and then from those legible first principles which are not.
4646832	4665630	B	0.5417775511741638	English specific, they're already in a space that has a lot more possibility and promise than, for example, a mere enumeration of important adjectives or nouns.
4666690	4675010	B	0.6603540182113647	We can develop lists of important adjectives and nouns when we have a broader cognitive modeling framework.
4675590	4684360	B	0.5824064016342163	And so this methodological turn then supports just a tremendous diversity of thought and work.
4685610	4700060	B	0.4903791546821594	Instead of asking us to kind of go through the eye of the needle and get on board with this one ranking of features and then try to apply it more broadly, that's like an overfit before the Cart situation.
4700510	4714880	B	0.6519943475723267	With Actimf, we can expand the methodological discussion, connect it to theoretical physics and mathematics in ways that really haven't been seen before, and then that opens up more than it closes down.
4715250	4732430	B	0.6691281795501709	It brings up more questions than it resolves in and of itself, but it opens the questions that can be resolved, like what generative model can I make that will keep the temperature in this building livable?
4732590	4736840	B	0.6552656292915344	But active inference isn't going to have a stance on what you should do for that building.
4738490	4752810	B	0.715705394744873	So we need to, in a way, take a step in the methodological direction, which I see as moving towards active inference to enable a million steps in different directions.
4757310	4759360	A	0.693164050579071	I have a bunch of questions here.
4760690	4764640	A	0.7278925180435181	I think one is probably just a reference question.
4765250	4767102	A	0.875720739364624	There are three topics that I'll say.
4767156	4773278	A	0.8778336048126221	If you guys have any papers or articles on those things, I would love to get a reference.
4773454	4784280	A	0.9065827131271362	One is, in what ways can we model a collection or an aggregation of active inference agents as a super agent?
4785930	4788038	A	0.8650616407394409	Active inference, super agent or something?
4788204	4795582	A	0.8906162977218628	And how does this decomposition and aggregation flexibility work in different contexts?
4795666	4805898	A	0.7970046401023865	If there's work that tries to either make informal commentary or formal modeling either ways, I would love to see that.
4805984	4806890	A	0.5093234777450562	Secondly.
4808770	4817934	B	0.8729064464569092	Just on the first, check out the previous section of this course on collective behavior, where I reviewed many such works.
4818132	4819038	A	0.9534879922866821	Great, thanks.
4819124	4821806	A	0.8810468912124634	Okay, is it on the same notion?
4821998	4823614	A	0.8267146944999695	Is it linked from the same notion.
4823662	4828002	B	0.8252367377281189	Thing all in the same places and in the same playlist with this course?
4828056	4829006	B	0.7510318756103516	Same syllabus?
4829118	4829538	B	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
4829624	4830210	A	0.5088188648223877	Got it.
4830280	4830900	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
4831830	4846002	A	0.9023618102073669	The second is, is there an active entrance account of, say, markets or economic interaction wherein your prices act as some sorts of information signals?
4846066	4853978	A	0.9230169653892517	And can you use active inference to then talk about aggregation of market entities or something?
4854144	4857414	A	0.8660485744476318	I'm guessing this would also be covered in the same list.
4857552	4868138	B	0.7478448152542114	Indeed, people have explored cognitive economics, and people are working on it, but that doesn't mean it's a done deal theoretically or especially in practice.
4868314	4870240	B	0.6889418363571167	So keep going.
4870850	4874800	C	0.7099392414093018	It's quite experimental still, but there are a bunch of people working on that, I guess.
4875730	4883286	C	0.8212613463401794	I don't remember any specific paper right now, but I can look it up and forward to you.
4883308	4885990	A	0.9436855912208557	But yeah, it would be great.
4886140	4888198	A	0.8701134324073792	I can drop my email address here.
4888284	4889320	C	0.48728978633880615	Yeah, sure.
4890250	4897770	A	0.5002291202545166	The third is probably more trickier than both of these, which is, is there an active inference account of natural language?
4900910	4901418	B	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
4901504	4913290	B	0.6773818135261536	Thankfully, colleagues like Elliot Murphy and others have explored specifically the linguistic aspects of natural speech.
4913450	4930418	B	0.5982307195663452	I think Lorena's lecture and area of focus generalizes a bit beyond specific natural language, because we're talking about semiotics and semantics in a more intermodal sense.
4930584	4938710	B	0.8466391563415527	However, yes, there's been limited work from a computational linguistics and neurobiology perspective on speech.
4940650	4952006	A	0.7404065132141113	Okay, so then okay, so you said something like first principles stuff.
4952108	4960566	A	0.49103665351867676	When you're making a commentary on what active inference brings, I'm still often struggling, what is active inference offering?
4960598	4962970	A	0.7932597994804382	And I try to encounter different things.
4963040	4971550	A	0.5064208507537842	I think I enjoy a lot of philosophical questions that the conversation opens up, but I'm still very ambivalent about the theory.
4972530	4982640	A	0.6598636507987976	And when I read this new book, which Friston has not written but is a co author, I don't remember the name of the book.
4985830	4987154	A	0.6659798622131348	Yeah, I don't exactly remember.
4987192	4994098	A	0.8591312170028687	There's a book, right, which is supposedly supposed to be the canon, and Friston is a co author, but in the.
4994104	5002182	B	0.8885573744773865	Preface, he says, so that's the 2022 Par Friston Pazula textbook, right?
5002236	5003800	A	0.5812638401985168	Par, yeah.
5004810	5012760	B	0.7836240530014038	I wouldn't quite say it's the canon, since it's a short book, but certainly it is a landmark moment for the field.
5013710	5014170	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
5014240	5028138	A	0.7373936772346497	And when I read that, the one thing that bothered me was it brings up the helmet's free energy thing, but it sort of argues it by fiat.
5028234	5030778	A	0.5444183945655823	Like, okay, this is a simple principle.
5030874	5038386	A	0.5073177814483643	It can model a lot of things, but that doesn't tell me why I should trust it.
5038568	5041266	A	0.8256781101226807	What is the reason to act?
5041448	5044450	A	0.519395649433136	Why does this principle lead to cognition?
5046070	5068540	A	0.48093661665916443	Sure, you've posited a very simple principle and then said, hey, look, this simple principle can explain so many things, but well, it also explained things that don't look like cognition, and I'm not sure I got an account of why that principle is works or something.
5069870	5071150	B	0.6572411060333252	Lorena, go for it.
5071220	5073150	B	0.7393386363983154	I'll think of some other ways to say it.
5073220	5082430	C	0.7983186841011047	Yeah, you can think of modeling by construction and modeling by first principles, and modeling by first principles.
5083490	5089220	C	0.5958049297332764	You have some limitations in which you cannot fully explain some things.
5089590	5108840	C	0.6520606279373169	But the virtue of the model and how the first principle organizes everything that comes along with the model usually might be sufficient or might be a useful tool to help you explain that phenomena that based on the first principle that you were bringing along.
5109470	5114154	C	0.8394614458084106	And that's one part of answering this question.
5114192	5118620	C	0.8025562763214111	I think it might be a big question for the field.
5119870	5124560	B	0.8203843235969543	Yeah, here's some short little threads on that.
5125330	5125838	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
5125924	5141406	B	0.519476592540741	We can describe maladaptive cognitive systems or adaptive cognitive systems, whether something's adaptive or not is always in relationship to its niche, like the foraging algorithm that works in the desert doesn't necessarily work in the rainforest.
5141518	5146542	B	0.6120216250419617	So these systems are not like intrinsically adaptive or not.
5146696	5154626	B	0.6683794260025024	We want to have natural language that allows sentences that are valid and invalid and have different kinds of semantics.
5154658	5164502	B	0.5090708136558533	So again, this is just an expressivity framework that enables people to build cognitive models of high reliability or important settings.
5164646	5172302	B	0.8284823894500732	Or you could make something that looks just like a beautiful circuit board and not even worry about what the outcome is.
5172436	5175562	B	0.7715982794761658	Yeah, for sure you can describe all kinds of systems.
5175706	5182254	B	0.8651474118232727	That would be like having a less than functional methodological system.
5182292	5190574	B	0.6472482085227966	If we said, well, we're doing a linear regression framework but we only want positive regressions, it's like, well, no, at the methodological level, we want it to be able to do any slope.
5190702	5198422	B	0.5010460019111633	So here in the cognitive modeling setting, we want more expressivity so that we can actually construct the ones that we're interested in.
5198556	5203830	B	0.6025083661079407	And then how does this really do cognition?
5204410	5218090	B	0.6299968361854553	How is it that a first principles like surprise minimization or the bounding of surprise through free energy, how can that really cover so many cognitive phenomena?
5218990	5221294	B	0.7472549676895142	That's the question and the play.
5221412	5229390	B	0.5941113829612732	But how is it that Newton's laws of motion can describe so many objects being dropped off a tower?
5230770	5238210	B	0.680630624294281	How is it that Bayesian mechanics can describe so many different priors being updated?
5238950	5259574	B	0.7182920575141907	And so by understanding cognitive paths as paths of least action, which is the free energy principle, a wide variety of models become of a similar kind, now become available.
5259772	5265334	B	0.8532370924949646	Yeah, whether that's useful to a given person in a given setting.
5265382	5269110	B	0.5328675508499146	Like if you make an active inference model of your business, it doesn't mean you're going to succeed.
5269190	5273200	B	0.5181898474693298	If you make a self driving car with active inference, it doesn't mean it's going to work.
5273650	5280138	B	0.5504429936408997	This isn't a guarantee of success, but it's a method that can be utilized.
5280314	5291330	B	0.5387974381446838	And we know that the method reaches different kinds of modeling outcomes and supports subsequent perspectives and models from where it reaches.
5292310	5300898	B	0.7872957587242126	But we can't a priori limit where the method reaches to only the successful ones or only biological systems.
5301074	5306790	B	0.4849337935447693	Then we wouldn't even have the expressivity to talk about cognitive ecosystems with synthetic intelligences.
5309850	5317382	C	0.7973281145095825	And when you're talking about cognition also we can use these kind of first principles to model aspects of cognition.
5317446	5331034	C	0.7560762166976929	But you might not necessarily think that cognition is all encompassing like that everywhere all the same, but you can use that to model specific things that you're interested in in cognitive behavior, like adaptivity.
5331162	5336290	C	0.8660867810249329	Does it give me any insight to understand what is adaptive behavior, for instance?
5336950	5339618	C	0.7781295776367188	And which kind of insights do I get?
5339704	5340626	C	0.7631043791770935	Are they interesting?
5340728	5341550	C	0.8337921500205994	Are they useful?
5341630	5347142	C	0.8136751055717468	So that's what the availability that this kind of model bring along.
5347276	5357880	C	0.7107626795768738	So you don't have to believe in the whole story, but it gives you a lot of leverage to ask questions and what kind of questions you'll be asking.
5361830	5391440	A	0.6874064803123474	Okay, so let's say that active inference and free energy allows me to talk about systems, but does it also give me vocabulary to then classify those systems in terms of, let's say adaptivity would be one property, but there could be other properties in terms of how rich the world model is or stuff like that.
5393330	5411320	B	0.8219637870788574	If you have a portfolio of generative models, you could summarize them according to the TJ statistic, you could summarize them according to the number of nodes, you could put them into a common environment or different environments and summarize their activity in any number of ways.
5412010	5420280	B	0.5296942591667175	But we can't talk about a ranking or a summarization of a portfolio of generative models that's not in hand.
5420650	5439360	B	0.6575629115104675	This is a framework that lets us build those diverse generative models and then in a very open ended way do model comparison, model selection, model adequacy, all the kinds of complex systems engineering methods that we want.
5441490	5450690	B	0.8540840148925781	And also I would ask you, where do you see a peer or a comparison first principle?
5451910	5461042	B	0.7257992625236511	Active inference has legible first principles which are reflected in the active inference ontology and expressions using it, which can be represented in natural language.
5461106	5477430	B	0.8046865463256836	So that's the talking about it, but it's not only represented in natural language, other frameworks have other first principles that may or may not be legible and people may choose different paths to go down for whichever number of reasons.
5478410	5487680	C	0.7218676209449768	Well, you can compare them, right models like they have the virtue, you can compare them and see which one gives you the best insight that you're looking for.
5489010	5500926	A	0.8328418731689453	Yeah, I think something that I could compare to active inference is like say the Bayesian utility maximization thing which has a different ontology.
5501118	5503060	A	0.8578158617019653	I'm not a fan of that either.
5504630	5516294	B	0.6866904497146606	I'll just note that Bayesian utility maximization is a special case of free energy where there's no Epistemic value, all you have is Pragmatic value and so a.
5516332	5520130	A	0.7747533917427063	Special diminished not necessarily.
5520210	5526860	A	0.6668666005134583	You have value of information and you have explore exploit trade offs in Beijing utility maximization as well.
5529390	5538858	B	0.8148669004440308	If you load into your utility function, if you can beg the question and load Epistem into Pragma, you're right, then all you need is Pragma.
5538954	5546282	B	0.5593545436859131	But in expected free energy we have Epistemic and Pragmatic value, which is what enables us this expressivity.
5546426	5548500	B	0.6697843670845032	But I think we're aligned on that.
5550950	5551650	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
5551800	5573080	A	0.5313162803649902	I think I'm somewhat also slightly confused because in the Bayesian utility between the languages, comparing the languages as such in the Bayesian utility maximization, the exploration parts that are prioritized based on your X anti estimation on the value of information.
5574190	5593040	A	0.7263677716255188	Whereas I'm not sure that holds true for the active inference model as well, that the Epistemic exploration is prioritized or valued in terms of some of the same Pragmatic thing as well.
5596050	5600626	B	0.5348770022392273	You'll have a lot to explore and learn.
5600728	5607342	B	0.832338273525238	You can make a model that is 80 20 or 2080 or 100 and zero between Epistemic and Pragmatic.
5607486	5608306	B	0.6101393103599548	There's nothing we.
5608328	5619080	B	0.7589830160140991	Can say across generative models about whether active inference prioritizes epistem or not because you can make a model that's 100% or zero.
5619770	5628940	A	0.5236886739730835	Sorry, I meant more like does active inference allow us to talk about systems that the Beijing utility maximization doesn't allow us to talk about?
5629310	5632730	A	0.7733484506607056	I'm talking particularly about expressive power of the language.
5634910	5639546	A	0.6919752359390259	Are there things that the Bayesian utility maximization can talk about that active inference cannot?
5639578	5643066	A	0.7632821798324585	Other things that active inference can talk about that Bayesian utility maximization cannot?
5643178	5644202	B	0.7526443600654602	Two short answers.
5644266	5645440	B	0.7611539959907532	One short answer.
5645970	5652660	B	0.796896755695343	Utility maximization must cram epistemic value into Pragmatic value.
5653430	5662690	B	0.6536992192268372	We gain more expressivity when we can articulate out Pragmatic value, which is the alignment of preferences with observations from epistemic value, which is information gain.
5662770	5664578	B	0.7171962261199951	So that's a huge articulation.
5664674	5675654	B	0.7582395672798157	And the second thing is when you're in an anything maximization framework, when you're in a utility function now, again, begging the question how you constructed this function that you're trying to maximize.
5675782	5688430	B	0.7358796000480652	But when you're in a maximization framework, we have a well known set of approaches for finding local and global maxima using optimization or maximization frameworks.
5688930	5701898	B	0.7645171880722046	What active inference uniquely provides is it describes the path that that cognitive thing takes as a path of least action that minimizes surprise.
5702074	5707182	B	0.6635355949401855	So instead of climbing to the top of the hill up, are we on a foothill or are we on the biggest hill?
5707326	5712706	B	0.5948105454444885	We're like a ball rolling to the bottom of the hill, finding the least surprising path.
5712818	5724434	B	0.7212926745414734	Now, that least surprising path can still include novelty and information gain, but it turns out to be a lot more tractable and connected with statistical physics and quantum mechanics.
5724562	5735610	B	0.7896193265914917	When we talk about the path of least action, ball rolling down the hill rather than this sort of question beg on top of a mountain climbing adventure Bayesian utility approach.
5738830	5741760	B	0.8379761576652527	But it's up to each person to feel how they want to feel.
5742130	5750900	C	0.8333519101142883	Yeah, and I think that a little bit what's in the book as well, when you take the low and high road for free energy principle, right?
5751750	5765270	C	0.7706239223480225	Because how much you want to have your utility maximization function being disconnected to the pragma, to the action.
5767210	5771538	C	0.5147251486778259	Because when you're modeling behavior, it will be hard to do that independently.
5771634	5774502	C	0.5428464412689209	Like, you have a lot of you have way more assumptions.
5774566	5782460	C	0.6839125156402588	You are committing to much a greater level of assumptions for your utility function if you don't do that.
5785010	5801522	C	0.7955034971237183	Because with the action first, that Pragmatizes, you have reasons to describe, have reasons to believe why that information gain works the way that it does, you can leverage some explanations on that.
5801656	5806382	C	0.5782122015953064	Without it, you have a model that has more assumptions.
5806446	5815542	C	0.7304472923278809	And I think if you have a model with less assumptions, it's always healthier, let's say so, yeah.
5815596	5822178	A	0.8637843728065491	So I think that does talk about the comparative analysis of the expressivity.
5822274	5828170	A	0.8968021869659424	But I would also say as a metaphor that I'm not happy with either of those languages.
5829790	5835514	A	0.715830385684967	I suspect that both of those languages claim certain ontological assumptions.
5835562	5840480	A	0.8059961199760437	And I'm always suspicious and wait, but where are these ontological assumptions coming from?
5841330	5842878	B	0.7455991506576538	A few other points.
5843044	5854366	B	0.606601893901825	We tap into an absolutely meaningful nexus of statistical methods and message passing schemes with active inference.
5854398	5863986	B	0.7001428008079529	If you can state something in the active inference ontology and construct a generative model then message passing algorithms can be deployed.
5864018	5866102	B	0.7699114680290222	That contractably compute that model.
5866156	5868130	B	0.5698615908622742	So that's absolutely nontrivial.
5868290	5872790	B	0.7232637405395508	Otherwise it's possible just to get wrapped up in some analytical formalism.
5873130	5880294	B	0.4837883710861206	But then once you want to do that on a 4K video now you're on square zero with the computer engineering.
5880342	5882026	B	0.7240501642227173	This is not that way.
5882208	5891886	B	0.7592048048973083	And then I will respond to your metapoint with a metapoint, which is when we've enumerated the alternatives, the one that we like best.
5892068	5893758	B	0.9098513126373291	Personally, I feel happy with.
5893844	5896186	B	0.5414981245994568	I'm also open to new alternatives arising.
5896218	5903380	B	0.6850391030311584	But being unhappy when all things considered is in play, why?
5905270	5913890	C	0.5363886952400208	What bothers you specifically on the ontology of the active imprint?
5915450	5935100	A	0.7906903624534607	Yeah, I think I'm still looking for I don't know what exactly I'm looking for, but I feel dissatisfied with the account given for why helmet's free energy, least action thing like, is the central thing here or something.
5936290	5937310	A	0.5515886545181274	Why does it work?
5937380	5938750	A	0.5339502096176147	Why does this principle?
5939890	5940640	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
5943490	5946350	B	0.6265013217926025	There'S a lot of funny answers I could give there.
5946500	5960760	B	0.5210558772087097	Yeah, that delta, that discrepancy, that's curiosity and that's the space of the open and that's learning and that's your unique contribution to make and that's everything.
5961130	5965270	B	0.5389021635055542	So that's not just a thorn in your shoe.
5965690	5974060	B	0.6395906805992126	That's like our experience of action amidst uncertainty, which is the water we're in.
5974590	5987406	B	0.6581511497497559	And so whether we take a higher order narrative perspective on that discrepancy being dissatisfying or that discrepancy being satisfying, I think it's pretty I just need to.
5987428	5989214	A	0.7498036026954651	Minimize my surprise there.
5989412	5992990	B	0.7546692490577698	Yeah, and you can choose to minimize your surprise through your attention.
5993410	5997822	B	0.836332380771637	You can choose to minimize surprise at a higher narrative order.
5997956	6006274	B	0.5826563835144043	Like, I am satisfied and complacent that I don't understand number theory but I use numbers to count objects around me.
6006472	6015350	B	0.6246045827865601	So that discrepancy and understanding knowing that there's 1000 years of research that could be done on numbers, it doesn't unsettle me.
6015500	6020162	B	0.61379075050354	But for someone else that might be unsettling and that might lead them to ruminate.
6020226	6022926	B	0.7847504615783691	It also might lead them to do a PhD in number theory.
6023058	6027690	B	0.8264367580413818	So just different paths for different individuals and contexts.
6028030	6031930	B	0.6893174052238464	But there's always so many technical and meta levels with active.
6035550	6050926	A	0.8350426554679871	So I don't want to keep you guys over time, but I would ask one last reference based thing, which is are there active inference accounts of seeing like, a state phenomena in any literature?
6051118	6055060	A	0.7617077231407166	I think I heard you mention it once, so I was like, yeah, look at this.
6056630	6057426	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
6057608	6060514	B	0.9322351217269897	Check out live stream 33 series.
6060562	6076874	B	0.8373012542724609	But also this course that we're literally actually enacting in with Avel is where these accounts come to roost and where we're creating a space to develop it.
6076912	6093710	B	0.7191473245620728	And it's not a cathedral for us just to spectate at today, but if you want to make an active inference generative model of whatever social setting, when you have the model in hand, a lot of your questions will be sidestepped.
6095650	6099026	A	0.836316704750061	Okay, where is the 33 thing that you mentioned?
6099208	6113282	B	0.8690633773803711	If you go to the page with all of our Institute live streams and look in the Live Stream series, like the paper discussions in the 33 series, there's a dot zero video with background and context.
6113426	6116754	B	0.8590108156204224	And then we have a dot one and a dot two conversation with the authors.
6116882	6135050	B	0.7678478956222534	But Avel, who's also the course coordinator for this course and research Avel's and colleagues work has heavily built on the seeing like a state, thinking like a state optimal grasp all these different topics.
6139580	6140952	A	0.7993384599685669	I'm on your YouTube channel.
6141006	6143930	A	0.6376471519470215	I'm slightly finding it hard to find the thing.
6146060	6157436	B	0.815284013748169	If you look up Live Stream 33.0 or if you go to in the video description of any video where it says all live streams here, go there and search for but you'll find it.
6157458	6160588	B	0.7411076426506042	And you can always email us or get in contact.
6160674	6176080	C	0.6952435374259949	But yeah, and I think a sales paper Thinking Like a State also can help you a lot to understand how active inference modeling is useful for the social sciences in comparison to other types of modeling.
6176160	6178768	C	0.5995692610740662	He makes a comprehensive description.
6178944	6179670	A	0.7792782783508301	Interesting.
6181560	6182710	A	0.9534879922866821	Great, thanks.
6183480	6188360	B	0.8830642700195312	And this is our first iteration on this course.
6188430	6207150	B	0.866992712020874	We are going to continue bringing new information to the table and supporting individuals who want to build generative models around this area, whether it's part of an internship program or part of a course credit or different kinds of programs that we'll be able to develop.
6208320	6215730	B	0.5958607196807861	But this is the real thing, and we're able to work with people who want to think and do.
6216980	6220092	B	0.5480974316596985	Makes sense indeed.
6220156	6222444	B	0.8644407391548157	Any closing thoughts, TJ?
6222572	6225030	B	0.9049831032752991	Then I will go and then Lorena with the last word.
6226920	6228212	A	0.8745487928390503	No, this was great.
6228266	6229860	A	0.9404100179672241	Thanks for the conversation.
6231240	6231764	B	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
6231802	6236836	B	0.9504560232162476	Well, thank you for Brennan TJ for joining Lorena for the lecture.
6236948	6239012	B	0.9525741338729858	This was a fun discussion.
6239076	6255256	B	0.805809736251831	We never really know where how it's going to go, but I'm glad that we could cover so many of these topics and probably raise more questions and footholds than door slams.
6255288	6256780	B	0.9661991596221924	So thank you again, Lorena.
6257440	6260284	C	0.9546921849250793	Yeah, thank you for inviting me.
6260322	6265904	C	0.5467771291732788	And I think active inference holds a lot of space for experimenting as well.
6265942	6279170	C	0.6465352177619934	Some things you try to see if they make sense and if they're going to hold up and open new questions, and that might be an interesting aspect of the framework itself.
6281860	6282688	B	0.9328439831733704	Thank you, everybody.
6282774	6285468	B	0.9892716407775879	Thank you, everybody, for the great live chat comments.
6285564	6286936	B	0.7669020891189575	There's a lot there.
6286958	6288360	B	0.8442119359970093	I couldn't read it all.
6288430	6290090	B	0.7429341673851013	So till next time.
6290540	6290900	C	0.5137446522712708	Bye.
