3330	60710	00:03	We're having a discussion section on semiotics and semantics here with Lorena Ganzerla. If you're watching Live, please feel free to write any questions in the Live chat.	This is a Live chat with Lorena Ganzerla from 2023	Semiotics and Semantics discussion section
62170	379010	01:02	I was suggesting that we could use biosemiotics as a as a model and as a theory for living creatures like language users to navigate the realm of symbols. In principle, it would be relative to meaningful to meaning. It's more like an idea or a way of modeling how we deal with meaningful situations.	What does it mean to talk about formal semantics in a way that is not loaded	In the realm of language and its meaning
386410	676780	06:26	There was a little bit of a double play with what is cropped. What we pay attention to, what we include in attention in our cognitive awareness, leaves the shadow, which is what we exclude. If we understand the processes of sense making and decision making that different kinds of cognitive agents do, we get a process based view.	What we crop in is the part that we're paying attention to	What is cropped and what is cropped out?

Predictive coding is like saying we're not even going to touch the semantics of what the sign is itself. It focuses on how information is transmitted.	Biomimicry can enhance biosemiotics by showing us how nature	Predictive coding in biosemiotics
1241220	1970240	20:41	How do we think about cultural meaning and principles in contrast to organizational? Organization is the enabling conditions for culture to arise. With active inference, we can build up from that story and see how it unfolds over time.	How do we think about cultural encoding and principles in contrast to organizational	Cultural Meaning and Organization
1971400	2803580	32:51	How do you navigate that when you talk about social phenomena in ants or termites? Do we dilute what the social means? And then on the other side, might we exclude phenomena that could importantly be considered social?	How do you define social phenomena in ants or termites	Philosophy of Social Systems
2803660	3309910	46:43	When we generalize, when we ask what words mean, we've lost touch with what any given word means. For that to be meaningful, it has to be embedded in a way of practicing it, like in a forestry practice. At some point, through our embodied thought and action in our experience, it is going to come down to the particulars.	If we want to talk about the semantics or semiotics biosomiotics	On Semiotics and Generalization
3312380	3680546	55:12	In active inference, it's embodied. It kind of needs to have a model. The knowledge itself has to come epistemically from where your agent is embedded and situated. How can you differentiate that so sharply when you talk about active imprints?	So when you talk about the object of knowledge and the knowledge itself and active inference	Active Inference and Self-Knowledge
3680568	3897966	1:01:20	The pragmatic component is about bringing our observations into alignment with our preferences. It's very cheap and easy to consider counterfactuals and situational awareness of social settings. If it can be not just understood but communicated, opens up a space where we're all playing Prisoners Dilemma.	The pragmatic component is about bringing our observations into alignment with our preferences	Inactive Inference and the Prisoner's Dilemma
3898068	4321830	1:04:58	If you're talking about this modeling of social actors and talking about several actors, if your model involves several of them, will not be really linear. How could we go about modeling multiscale social goals so we could think about different citizens in a region?	Daniel: Modeling social goals takes specific iterations that will not be fully linear	Social Networks and the Law of Development
4326090	4889320	1:12:06	TJ: What brings you to active inference and what do you think active inference adds to our theoretical understanding and in what ways. Lorena: Is it also your area of interest? TJ: There are a bunch of questions here.	I'm curious what are your interests in active inference	What does active Inference add to our theoretical account of the social
4890250	5357880	1:21:30	Is there an active inference account of natural language? Thankfully, colleagues like Elliot Murphy and others have explored the linguistic aspects of natural speech. What is active inference offering? I think it might be a big question for the field.	Is there an active inference account of natural language? Yes	Is there an Active Inference Account of Natural Language?
5361830	6031930	1:29:21	Active inference has legible first principles which are reflected in the active inference ontology. Is there anything that the Bayesian utility maximization can talk about that active inference cannot? We gain more expressivity when we can articulate out Pragmatic value.	Active inference and free energy allow me to talk about systems	Bayesian Inference and Expected Free Energy
6035550	6220092	1:40:35	Check out live stream 33 series. Are there active inference accounts of seeing like, a state phenomena in any literature? This is our first iteration on this course. We are going to continue supporting individuals who want to build generative models around this area.	Are there active inference accounts of seeing like a state in any literature	Active Inference 3.0
6220156	6290900	1:43:40	Brennan TJ: This was a fun discussion. I think active inference holds a lot of space for experimenting as well. Thank you, everybody, for the great live chat comments. There's a lot there.	TJ: This was a fun discussion. We never know where it's going to go	A Day in the Life of Active Inference
