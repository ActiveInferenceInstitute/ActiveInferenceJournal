420	55240	00:00	You. All right. And we are in the discussion section, basics of Active Inference. This is the first discussion section that we've had for this course. And it's going to be regarding the topics that Ben White introduced in his recent lecture. Perhaps some of our first time live streaming guests.	Discussion section on basics of Active Inference begins July 25, 2023	
67850	185020	01:07	Darius is a Master's student at UCL in social distributed cognition. Francisco Balsan is a PhD student at the University of Bologna, Italy. Working on intersection between artificial intelligence and education. Currently interested in multiscale active inference models of scientific cognition.

188760	332260	03:08	Would anybody else like to introduce themselves before we start? So you go first. I'm using perceptual control theory at the minute to model examples of effective practice in organizations. How might that level of abstraction be useful in what I'm doing?	Would anybody else like to introduce themselves before we start? So you go first. I'm Regina Sagin	In the Know: Perceptual Control Theory
333350	469858	05:33	The lecture last week was on the basics of active inference. The objective really was to lay the groundwork for future weeks in this course. In the subsequent weeks, we're going to be looking at topics like collective behavior, social cognition, shared norms. The questions here don't have to be specifically tethered to that lecture.	The lecture last week was on the basics of active inference	Basic questions on Active Inference
470024	1004038	07:50	How does creativity and science in general enter active imperents? How does trying to be creative and not doing what you predict enter this room? Feel free to jump in whenever you want.	How does trying to be creative enter active imperents in science	Dark Room and Creativity
1004134	1099800	16:44	There's something really special in the creation of art, especially in a public sphere, that I think is so interesting. There's a new collection coming out in Philosophical Trans B on Art and Predictive Processing. There are ways that we can bring our Generative model out and put it into the public sphere.	There are ways we can bring our Generative model out and put it into public sphere	Art and Predictive Processing
1101390	1532360	18:21	There's lots and lots of stuff on the value of uncertainty. It kind of is very much at the forefront of some of the really interesting philosophical applications of the framework. Also, we have a new paper coming out on horror movies. I'm pretty interested in this, but it's the same as going to the magic show.	There are some interesting papers on the value of uncertainty in predictive processing	Ah, the Value of Uncertainty
1534730	1891000	25:34	Darius: My question is regarding the notion of affordances. I was just wondering whether, as philosophers, you and Mark have thought about what is it like for the whole system to be in the business of reducing its prediction error. Could affordances change based on the agent arena relationship?	Eric Brunsten: I'm interested in flow states and affordances	On the Fluidity of Affordances
1891450	2166126	31:31	Ben: There's a distinction between a landscape of affordances and a field of affordance. The distinction is directly targeting the dynamic, shifting, very affective nature of affordedances. As soon as you provoke affordance, you're provoking phenomenology, Ben says.	Ben: Darius makes a distinction between landscape and field of affordances	Exploring the Landscape of Affordances
2166228	2383990	36:06	The symmetry of agents and environment is a property of active inference. There are basically three position you can have on that. One is that active inference is correct. Another is that we don't have affordances based on whatever is the formal presentation. And the third is thatactive inference is wrong.	Frazier principle says that agents and environment have affordances	Active Inference and Phenomenology
2387210	2481090	39:47	Anybody else want to come in on a question of affordances? Because I know affordance has played a fairly substantial role in the lecture. Anybody has any questions related to affordances or action perception affordances, then now's the time.	Anybody else want to come in on a question of affordances	A Question on Affordances in AI
2481160	2675350	41:21	Darius: There's a point at which the theory of affordances starts to break down to ambient technology. Early stages of a paper on the role of generative AI in classrooms. I'm trying to follow it through the active inference framework from a multi level perspective.	Early stages of a paper on the role of generative AI in classrooms	The role of generative AI in classrooms
2677930	3202620	44:37	Ben mark: Is there a conflict there between the general priors that the system has and then violating those expectations by going over and above them? How do you kind of resolve that tension? Mark: Precision is going to be weighted in lots of different ways. The real frontier of this research is to find how these things are instantiated.	Ben Marks: System is monitoring its own predictive processing regimes	Measuring the quality of predictions
3207060	3662976	53:27	In organizations, there tends to be a drift towards risk aversion. How does the value of uncertainty translate onto how is it scalable in that sense? One of the things we're going to see in subsequent weeks is how it scales up to larger systems.	Ryan Smith: How does the value of uncertainty translate onto how is it scalable	The value of uncertainty in business
3663158	3722100	1:01:03	You can take an active role in mindfully observing your own reactions to volatility. Something really special happens when the system models its own reaction. How that translates into business, I'm not sure. I know tolerance to uncertainty is a marker of business success.	Systems learn to tolerate uncertainty when it models its own reaction to volatility	Understanding the Value of Risk
3722440	4130856	1:02:02	Mark Whitaker: Is there anything about the role of language in kind of modulating those metacognitive? He says language might help by invoking cognitive flexibility. Whitaker says we can also manage volatility by redeploying precision in a better way.	Nick Clark: Language can help manage volatility by invoking cognitive flexibility	The role of language in the management of uncertainty
4130878	4229960	1:08:50	Risk and danger are two things that I've been really interested in across a kind of variety of different contexts. Even in the case of a collective like a business, you still have to take into account the environment in which the business is operating. This is something that's probably going to come up again in subsequent weeks.	I would emphasize the importance of external context here as well	Contextualization of Risk and Danger
4230030	4445708	1:10:30	Flow is a phenomenological offshoot of being optimally reducing prediction error. It seems to me that that becomes a regulatory function when that optimality is reduced. I'm wondering how deep that runs and what we can say about the role of agency and selfhood.	Flow seems to reduce self consciousness when optimally producing prediction error	The Limits of Self-Language
4445794	4587690	1:14:05	There's some really interesting work on psychedelics by George Dean and some of George Dean's co conspirators. A paper recently showed the efficacy of internal self talk on sports performance. It calls into question to what extent are these psychotechnologies effective?	There's some interesting work on psychedelics by George Dean and others	Self-talk and the neuroscience of consciousness
4588380	4708770	1:16:28	Self food is a high level construct that emerges from the ability we have to compare our activity to a socially embedded model of our activity. This enables a very deep, very profound and robust transmission of cultural knowledge and transmission of norms. If anybody has any final kind of quick questions or comments, maybe we can move towards wrapping it up.	Self food is the ability to compare our activity to a socially embedded model	A final discussion on Self-Food
4712180	4960000	1:18:32	How can a framework whose imperative is surprise, minimization and bounding be used to generate novelty? People provided a lot of really cool answers. We eventually plan to develop a transcript which will be curated and published, and eventually enabled with speech modeling to generate podcast quality audio.	The talk started with surprise and creativity and ended with self talk	The Future of Creativity
4961060	5144748	1:22:41	There's a tendency to think of creativity as still like it's almost like the last bastion of internal cognitiveist thinking. But creativity is just as much extended and embedded as everything else. Even the most creative processes are subject to external agent environment system.	Could I just add something on the topic of creativity under active inference	Cognitive Science: Creativity and the Extended Mind
5144914	5428580	1:25:44	Michael: What would people like to learn or focus on about collective behavior? creativity is intrinsically very hard to model because by definition, creativity is something that brings about something new. Anyone else want to give a thought on collective behavior or on any other aspect?	Michael: What would people like to learn about about collective behavior	Collective Behavior
5429800	5526690	1:30:29	What comes to mind for me at the know, I mentioned units of collective. What might be some of the most well understood limiting beliefs about when we use language of collective that keeps us repeating the same blind spots? How might we think differently about collective so that we escape those predispositions?	I'm looking forward to the solo lecture on collective thinking	Unpacking the Units of Collective
5532170	5554660	1:32:12	All right, then. Hope everyone is enjoying the course so far. Thanks, Avel, again for coordinating it. And to Ben for this great section. See you all next time.	All right, then. Hope everyone is enjoying the course so far	Courses 1,2
