5180	5896	2	Daniel	0.97	All right.
5998	7896	3	Daniel	0.71	July 25, 2023.
7918	13780	4	Daniel	0.93	And we are in the discussion section, basics of Active Inference.
13860	20148	5	Daniel	0.99996	This is the first discussion section that we've had for this course, so thank you all for joining.
20324	27260	6	Daniel	1	And it's going to be regarding the topics that Ben White introduced in his recent lecture.
27420	33810	7	Daniel	0.96195	So everyone will be welcome to pop in and introduce themselves.
34260	44468	8	Daniel	0.97	And then I know that Ben has some ideas to discuss and many other spontaneous and written questions will come into play.
44634	55240	9	Daniel	0.99883	So with that exit for now and pass to perhaps some of our first time live streaming guests.
67850	71686	10	Darius	0.86	I guess I've already spoken, so I may as well continue.
71788	73050	11	Darius	0.99285	So I'm Darius.
73790	75002	12	Darius	1	I am Master's student.
75056	80006	13	Darius	0.99919	I'm just about to finish at UCL in sort of social distributed cognition.
80118	94202	14	Darius	1	I work in a social cognition lab looking at salience regulation and attentional mechanisms within social contexts, but all within an active inference framework, within the Bayesian brain hypothesis framework.
94346	98762	15	Darius	0.99	And, yeah, it's a sort of recent discovery and obsession.
98826	102740	16	Darius	1	And so I'm sort of getting to grips with both the high road and the low road.
103350	113430	17	Darius	0.99	And so I've had the opportunity to chat to Mark and some other researchers who have been super informative, but always looking to learn more and get my head around even more of the sort of philosophical and mathematical theory.
115770	116520	18	A	0.88475	Cool.
117530	118600	19	A	0.99892	Sounds good.
124170	124822	20	Francisco	0.99281	Hi, everyone.
124876	125880	21	Francisco	0.99997	Can you hear me?
126410	127298	22	Daniel	0.7531	Yep.
127474	129022	23	Francisco	0.99853	I'm Francisco Balsan.
129106	137040	24	Francisco	0.99925	I'm a PhD student at the University of Bologna, Italy, actually working on intersection between artificial intelligence and education.
137890	146494	25	Francisco	1	I have a background in cognitive anthropology and philosophy of science, and I met Axel and Maxlin a few years ago.
146692	160222	26	Francisco	0.98971	So I dive into the rabbit hole of active inference and currently pretty much interested in multiscale active inference models of scientific cognition.
160286	169842	27	Francisco	0.99954	So pretty interested about the agent level modeling of scientific reasoning assumption that might emerge from the interaction with a scientific environment.
169906	176398	28	Francisco	0.98908	So we're referring to scientific nature, construction and all these type of top down and bottom up interactions.
176434	180202	29	Francisco	0.918	So super interested to hear something from you.
180336	181260	30	A	0.99715	Thank you.
183630	185020	31	A	0.99988	Thank you very much.
188760	191990	32	A	0.99491	Would anybody else like to introduce themselves before we start?
194840	196310	33	A	0.48648	So you go first.
196840	197348	34	Gina	0.66914	Okay.
197434	199504	35	Gina	0.78217	Hi, I'm Regina Sagin.
199632	200844	36	Gina	0.95221	You can call me Gina.
200912	202340	37	Gina	0.99923	I'm from Guatemala.
202420	205348	38	Gina	0.48	And well, I'm not from the social sciences.
205444	207828	39	Gina	1	I come from biology and neuroscience.
207924	218008	40	Gina	0.98	And I'm here because I'm working on a project as a technical operator in this big project in the Xscape and material minds.
218104	224680	41	Gina	0.98	And I do the technical part and experiments, but I want to learn the philosophical part.
224770	228880	42	Gina	0.84138	That's the background that makes the theory of everything.
228950	231436	43	Gina	0.99995	We're going to experiment.
231548	233330	44	Gina	0.99996	So I'm here to learn.
234340	246384	45	Gina	0.65	And also, I am like when you see the Olympics, that you see all the swimmers, and I wish there was a normal guy to see how good these people are so you could compare.
246432	248292	46	Gina	0.98425	So that's me today, right?
248426	253656	47	Gina	1	I understand half of what's going on, but I'm happy to be here, so yeah.
253758	254410	48	Gina	0.98167	Hi.
261560	261924	49	A	0.98381	Sorry.
261962	262736	50	G	0.96901	I'm Leigh.
262848	264128	51	G	0.95771	So my name is Lee.
264224	270120	52	G	0.92854	I'm a PhD student at the University of York studying systems transformation.
271420	283748	53	G	0.98	And I'm joining because I'm using perceptual control theory at the minute to model examples of effective practice in organizations.
283844	299404	54	G	0.63	And I've read quite a lot of active inference papers, and I understand that there's a lot of resonance overlap between perceptual control theory and active inference, although I understand it's within a predictive framework.
299532	311684	55	G	1	And also it's kind of a level of abstraction higher, so you're able to kind of quantify the difference between sort of the predictive state or the outcome state and the current state.
311802	327080	56	G	0.99994	So what I'm really trying to understand is how might that level of abstraction be useful in what I'm doing, actually, because I understand it's a much more kind of concurrent theory and framework than perceptual control theory.
330950	332260	57	A	0.9984	Yeah, very cool.
333350	334500	58	A	0.99983	Anybody else?
337830	338980	59	A	0.95771	Is that everybody?
341670	349240	60	A	0.99819	Okay, well, has everybody seen the lecture that I gave a couple of weeks ago?
350170	362540	61	A	0.99525	Okay, so I think it might be helpful then, if I kind of very briefly go over what we covered in that lecture just to kind of jog people's memories, and then we can maybe pick up some questions from there.
363070	373374	62	A	0.99985	So the lecture last week was on the basics of active inference, and it was intended to be an introduction to the framework on a very abstract, philosophical level.
373412	377818	63	A	0.99996	So it left out all of the kind of mathematics and technical aspects of the framework.
377994	389454	64	A	1	And the objective really was to lay the groundwork for future weeks in this course, because this is obviously a course on active inference in the social sciences.
389582	398914	65	A	1	And so in the subsequent weeks, we're going to be looking at topics like collective behavior, social cognition, shared norms, and niche construction.
399042	410534	66	A	1	And so what I wanted to do was to put on the table a kind of fully fleshed out picture of what the individual agent looks like in active inference.
410662	427066	67	A	1	And so to do this, we looked at emotion, agency, mind, so we looked at kind of the role of action and perception, the role of internal representations in active inference.
427178	441490	68	A	1	And then as a case study, we looked at an active inference based account of addiction to kind of bring all of these threads together, to kind of articulate a lot of the things that I'd said in the previous sections.
446250	450786	69	A	1	The questions here don't have to be specifically tethered to that lecture.
450898	461980	70	A	1	I suppose we can just start with any general questions about active inference and philosophy and how active inference applies to individual agents, or if anybody did want to pick up on any threads from the lecture, then we can go from there.
466210	469858	71	Gina	0.99991	Can I ask something just for the basic questions?
470024	471140	72	A	0.99984	Yeah, of course.
471830	482770	73	Gina	1	I don't understand because I think you explain it later, but how does creativity and science in general enters active imperents?
483130	490360	74	Gina	0.99942	How does trying to be creative and not doing what you predict enters this room?
490810	493640	75	A	0.99972	Yeah, this is a really good question.
495710	497210	76	A	0.99996	Did you see the lecture?
498670	501100	77	Gina	0.90898	Yeah, but I remember half of it.
501630	506620	78	A	0.9998	That's fine, but do you remember the dark room problem?
507090	510000	79	Gina	0.99987	Yeah, I know that's where the answer is.
513090	521410	80	A	1	I think there are several interesting dark room problem, some of them more interesting than others.
521480	525890	81	A	1	And I tried to cover I obviously didn't have time to cover all of those in the lecture.
527750	548810	82	A	0.99949	But for those that perhaps aren't familiar, the dark room problem is this kind of canonical philosophical worry about predictive processing and active inference that says essentially, if all we're trying to do is minimize prediction errors, why don't we just find maximally predictable environments?
549150	556250	83	A	0.76	And why do we not just lay in a dark room hooked up to an intravenous drip and enjoy kind of error free lifestyle?
556910	560894	84	A	0.99442	So I think that's the question that you're articulating there.
561092	563306	85	A	1	I just quickly see a hand from Darius.
563338	565760	86	A	0.99871	Darius, did you want to jump in, or was it a separate question?
567490	568814	87	Darius	0.92439	It's a separate question.
568932	570794	88	Darius	0.57061	So I thought I would just do it in advance.
570842	571806	89	Darius	0.85603	But yeah, no, ignore me.
571828	573218	90	A	0.90366	I'll circle a call background in a second then.
573224	575506	91	A	0.80068	But feel free, I should say.
575528	584514	92	A	0.99947	Actually, this is the first time I've kind of chaired a discussion like this, so I'll be explicit and say people should just feel free to jump in whenever they want.
584552	591880	93	A	0.95364	If you want to take the disco, if you want to kind of add something or kind of build on a question that we're answering, feel free to jump in.
592970	610510	94	A	0.99189	But, yeah, with the dark room problem, as I'm aware, the first answer to that question and this is something that I did cover in the lecture, is essentially a big part of active inference is to recognize that agents are it's a kind of fundamentally embodied framework, okay?
610580	614462	95	A	0.93181	So that can be kind of cashed out in various ways.
614516	630210	96	A	0.99984	But one of the most important ways is that the expected states of the organism or that the agent are necessarily rooted in the phenotype of the organism and the kind of evolutionary biological needs that come with having a particular body.
630360	636774	97	A	0.99427	So there was a paper that I referenced in a lecture by there's three authors on this paper.
636892	641794	98	A	0.97994	It's andy Clark, Karl Friston, and then I'm forgetting the name of the third author.
641842	645494	99	A	0.99615	If anybody can recall, feel free to drop it in the chat.
645622	665146	100	A	0.99977	But this is an answer to the dark room, where it builds on that notion of embodiment and says, look, creatures like us, human agents, could sit in the dark room and do nothing and just kind of enjoy the very predictable march of hunger, thirst, et cetera.
665178	668110	101	A	0.99887	But obviously, those particular biologists out of the room.
668260	671060	102	A	1	And so you have this very fundamental level.
673830	679314	103	A	0.97192	We have this very fundamental kind of basis upon which we have these needs that need to be met.
679352	686614	104	A	1	And so we need to engage in exploratory behaviors on the topic of novelty, because that's a kind of base.
686652	689160	105	A	1	I take that to be a kind of baseline answer.
689770	706230	106	A	0.99997	But there are clearly kinds of activities and behaviors that we do engage in going beyond the dark room kind of curiosity play, creativity, engaging in kind of why do we create works of art?
706400	716990	107	A	0.95	And there's not an obvious link between those kinds of behaviors and the kinds of biological needs that are emphasized in the original answer to the dark room worry.
717970	730174	108	A	0.97296	So in answer to Regina's question about creativity, I think that a good starting point for this is the section on aerodynamics that I introduced in the lecture.
730222	744690	109	A	0.97868	So this was the idea that there's this strong connection between affectivity as a kind of emotional, embodied feeling state and the changes to the rate in prediction error minimization.
744850	746070	110	A	0.99286	So I don't know.
746220	749994	111	A	1	I am now very much articulating Mark's work here.
750032	754940	112	A	0.99523	So I don't know if Mark wants to jump in at any point and do a much better job than I can.
758530	762170	113	A	1	I think there's certainly work on the horizon.
762330	772770	114	A	1	I know that there are people who are currently building up theories of artisticity that are based on this idea of aerodynamics.
773110	805290	115	A	0.99463	So Mark's paper on play with Mark Anderson that I mentioned has a really interesting idea where if you explore playful behaviors which are kind of fundamentally creative and it's an inherently creative exercise, I think the really interesting idea that comes out of that is one thing that we engage in because it feels good is we create niches of very manageable prediction error that we can then minimize.
807410	812382	116	A	0.99775	So, yeah, that's playful behavior is the answer to the puzzle of play.
812436	823374	117	A	0.99963	So the puzzle of play is why do we engage in metabolically quite costly and they don't have any obvious benefit.
823502	833566	118	A	1	And the idea there is that, well, there's kind of several ideas in there, but one of them is that it just literally feels good because minimizing prediction error feels good to us.
833608	837480	119	A	0.99972	So whenever we do better than expect at minimizing prediction error, it feels good.
840010	851980	120	A	1	Obviously, I don't know for sure, but I think that any answer that we give regarding artistic creativity is going to fall within that kind of bulb that essentially we engage in.
852350	869306	121	A	0.61	The part of the creative process is just constructing those that give us tasks of manageable prediction error that ideally fit at the boundaries of our skilled capabilities.
869338	871170	122	B	0.99404	Can I add two quick things there, Ben?
871510	881250	123	B	0.99723	So that was a great explanation, but just to hit two points a little bit harder, one, you might think all that matters error.
882250	891938	124	B	0.99781	That's why it looked a little bit paradoxical that we also create antithetical to our modus operandi, which is to reduce error.
892034	898330	125	B	0.99996	But when you remember that for our kind prediction error minimizing system, we have a really deep temporal model.
898480	906310	126	B	0.88917	We're managing uncertainty at a big horizon, maybe even multigenerational, where we're thinking about our kids or our kids.
906400	909354	127	B	0.99	I mean, who knows how deep the Generative model actually runs?
909482	929490	128	B	0.99994	It turns out that error over that stops developing error minimizing skills and abilities and just hangs out in one microniche, because that microniche is going to be upset sooner, right?
929560	939014	129	B	0.75	I mean, it's such a great example of where we thought we were in a really set vector state and then suddenly it gets jostled and all of us go, oh my goodness, what do we do?
939052	940230	130	B	0.99998	We've been bumped.
940810	951174	131	B	1	And it turns out that the best error minimize will be the two kinds of errors that are hates.
951222	953782	132	B	0.99999	Those errors are digestible.
953926	959614	133	B	0.99999	So that means not too complex that you can't do anything with it, you can't learn anything from it, but also not so boring that there's nothing to learn.
959732	971714	134	B	0.99992	If we hang out, if we're sensitive to and we hang out at the edge of our capability, then we keep developing new error minimizing abilities, which actually sets us up to be good error minimizing systems over the long run.
971752	982978	135	B	0.99993	So even though we're investing metabolism now, we're setting ourselves up to be able to manage, especially in the deep end of the pool, black swans manage uncertainty that we're not going to be able to predict.
983074	984242	136	B	0.83774	They're really unpredictable.
984306	988050	137	B	0.99682	Unpredictable that comes from hanging out at this edge.
988130	997906	138	B	0.99997	So part of our curiosity and playfulness and creativity are going to be about us making and digesting novel slopes of Volatility.
998018	1004038	139	B	1	I think that's one really great answer for why you get playfulness and curiosity out of this and creativity.
1004134	1007194	140	B	0.92744	I'll just drop one more and we don't have to get into it too deeply here.
1007232	1009580	141	B	0.99992	But here's one other one that we're thinking of.
1010030	1018640	142	B	0.99682	There's something really special in the creation of art, especially in a public sphere, that I think is so interesting and that somebody needs to be sort of looking at this.
1019330	1029730	143	B	0.79125	There's actually a new collection coming out in Philosophical Trans B on Art and Predictive Processing, which I think you should check out if you're interested in these topics.
1030310	1037922	144	B	0.99991	But the idea that we've been thinking about is there are ways that we can bring our Generative model out and put it into a public sphere.
1038066	1049580	145	B	1	You can take something which is typically on the inside and you can put it outside, and then you can have other error minimizing systems look at it and fiddle around with it and then we can reimbibe it.
1050110	1051674	146	B	0.60465	We're doing this all the time.
1051792	1054554	147	B	0.99996	That's what language allows us to do and what writing allows us to do.
1054592	1055542	148	B	0.92508	Think about maths.
1055606	1065150	149	B	0.99936	You're bringing up part of your predictive understanding, you're laying it out and then other predictive agents can fiddle around with it and then you can take it back in as part of your updating your own model.
1065300	1067902	150	B	0.99	And I don't know how much more I can say here.
1068036	1069834	151	B	0.98	I just think this is a kind of horizon.
1069882	1071906	152	B	0.99974	But I think there's a really juicy thing to say here.
1072008	1074434	153	B	0.99961	About where real art is.
1074472	1075214	154	B	0.99952	Like Tolstoy.
1075262	1095574	155	B	0.99967	Maybe Leo Tolstoy was already on this, where you put something of the Creator in the Creation and then other people receive that and then they can do something else with it, and then you're able to sort of take it back in all under the guise of sort of Minimizing Volatility or understanding Volatility, maybe.
1095612	1096790	156	B	0.99999	That was a bit deep.
1097130	1099046	157	A	0.99955	No, that was really good.
1099148	1099800	158	A	0.81416	Yeah.
1101390	1110554	159	A	0.97355	So in the chat I just dropped a link to yeah, so somebody just asked about papers related to hanging out at Edge of Our Capabilities.
1110682	1111920	160	B	0.93243	I'll do that right now.
1112370	1114446	161	A	0.90118	There sure are some papers on that.
1114548	1115598	162	A	0.99812	Mark's got a few.
1115684	1131380	163	A	1	I already dropped a link in there to an Aon article by some of the old Expect project crew, including Mark Kate Nave, George Dean and Andy Clark on the value of uncertainty, which is I think it's a really good start point for some of these questions.
1132390	1140642	164	A	0.99884	Just because Aeon is a kind of non academic place where, you know, it's a non technical introduction.
1140706	1145922	165	A	0.92	And there's a wonderful example in that paper of a guy named I think it's Max Hawkings.
1145986	1146474	166	A	0.99926	Is that right?
1146512	1146810	167	A	0.85	Mark?
1146880	1148314	168	A	0.73071	Max who?
1148512	1153338	169	A	0.92305	He's a kind of tech guy and he realized he was getting kind of bored with his life.
1153504	1161850	170	A	0.64165	He'd inadvertently trapped himself in a dark room because his life had become so rote and scheduled and systematic.
1161930	1172722	171	A	0.99998	He realized that he would be kind of incredibly easy to kidnap because he was in the same place at the same time every single day and he took drastic action to break out of that dark room.
1172776	1184498	172	A	0.99989	So he kind of introduced a randomization algorithm that it would kind of choose for him where he was going to eat, where he was going to go, which shows he was going to attend.
1184674	1188310	173	A	1	And this example is a really nice centerpiece in this article.
1189370	1204202	174	A	1	I think this is a nice place to start because it's also grounded in discussions about epistemic actions as well, because there's also as cool as play and art and creativity are there's also really good reasons that uncertainty is valuable as well?
1204256	1204522	175	A	0.99726	Right?
1204576	1223282	176	A	0.99992	Because while we might want to exploit all of the opportunities for kind of nourishment and valuable prediction error minimization in our environment, there are of course going to be times where those opportunities are exhausted and we need to go and explore different ones.
1223416	1230482	177	A	1	And I think there's some stuff in there as well on epistemic actions within the context of navigation as well.
1230536	1239014	178	A	0.99948	So sometimes we're going to have to temporarily move further away from our target in order to minimize our uncertainty about where we're going.
1239132	1250230	179	A	0.99982	So there's lots and lots of stuff on the value of uncertainty and it kind of is very much at the forefront of some of the really interesting philosophical applications of the framework.
1250310	1251100	180	A	0.99998	For sure.
1252110	1254522	181	A	0.98856	Okay, by all means.
1254576	1255660	182	A	0.91888	Yeah, we've got time.
1256350	1260442	183	Gina	1	I know you have a question that is but with the value of uncertainty.
1260506	1275406	184	Gina	0.4251	It's just that I'm thinking because I've been working a lot with the magicians and there's a way of using uncertainty as entertainment that it's very difficult to understand as a concept for entertainment.
1275438	1283458	185	Gina	0.99999	Why would you like to be in a place where you want to predict but you cannot, and you still want to participate in this activity?
1283554	1287320	186	Gina	0.99656	So for me, magic shows, it's kind of breaking a little.
1290730	1300998	187	A	0.4189	Spoke to I forget the person's name, but there was an Xcape meeting here at Sussex and I spoke to one of the guys on Escape who had been working on magic.
1301174	1305210	188	A	1	I don't know if you know who I'm talking about, but I think they have a book on magic.
1305710	1314410	189	A	0.99	And I think that's really cool to think about from a predictive processing perspective, the idea that magic is just these wonderful kind of violations of expectations.
1314570	1321300	190	A	0.99949	In a certain sense, I think predictive processing provides a nice, really intuitive framework for thinking about those kinds of things.
1321670	1323502	191	B	1	One little point there, Regina.
1323566	1333998	192	B	0.99966	Just about again, if it feels paradoxical just to sort of complexify your view, remember that this is always happening in a hierarchical system.
1334184	1342802	193	B	0.99985	So just because you have errors at one level of the system doesn't mean you're going to have sort of critical, cascading, unbearable errors at higher levels.
1342946	1345826	194	B	0.99985	So that's why it's fun to go to horror movies.
1345938	1347334	195	B	0.9999	So I dropped the paper here.
1347372	1349606	196	B	0.80775	Also, we have a new paper coming out on horror movies.
1349638	1354714	197	B	0.99988	I'm pretty interested in this, but it's the same as going to the magic show in some way.
1354832	1361150	198	B	1	Now, the reason why those errors are fun is because we're safe in a theater.
1361570	1363054	199	B	0.99951	We're with our friends.
1363252	1366910	200	B	0.99999	We have lots of sugar in our system from eating popcorn and candy.
1367490	1373220	201	B	1	We can control the amount of scary by covering our eyes.
1374870	1376738	202	B	0.99908	There's lots of control here.
1376824	1395490	203	B	1	And yet we're getting media that's pinging all of our evolutionarily ancient error tracking systems so that we're getting jumps in the physiology as if there's a bunch of volatility that we need to manage, and yet we're in a completely safe space, which is really fun for our kind of system because we're hierarchically deep predictive systems.
1395570	1397798	204	B	1	The high level here isn't jeopardized.
1397974	1404054	205	B	0.72086	It knows I'm in a theater, but the low level stuff is still registering all sorts of literal volatilities.
1404102	1405574	206	B	0.99999	But of course, they get squashed.
1405702	1407740	207	B	0.91756	They don't cascade all the way up.
1408990	1418286	208	B	0.99999	Or if you're the kind of person where they do tend to cascade all the way up, then you're also the kind of person who doesn't like going to horror movies because it kind of scares you.
1418388	1422626	209	B	0.79	Go home and think, oh, goodness, maybe ghosts are real and maybe I live with them.
1422648	1423650	210	B	0.99975	You wouldn't be going there then.
1423720	1431570	211	B	0.98603	So with magic, it's the same sort of thing with error.
1432810	1441938	212	B	0.67	I don't know if you've ever who does the really extreme magic.
1442034	1444002	213	B	0.66791	David Blaine, where he was in a block.
1444066	1445318	214	B	0.97846	Yeah, david Blaine, have you ever seen him?
1445324	1449270	215	B	0.54708	He goes to Haiti where you have a community that really believes in magic, and he does some magic and he gets into trouble.
1449350	1454550	216	B	0.65457	Like suddenly all the young men are, no, no, that's no bueno.
1454710	1455834	217	B	0.58458	That you're doing this.
1455872	1460326	218	B	0.99	And then the camera pans back and he, no, no, hold you here, I'll show you how it's done.
1460368	1461514	219	B	0.99998	It was just a trick.
1461642	1462494	220	B	0.99982	I'll just show you outside.
1462532	1466410	221	B	0.74788	It's not real magic because there they're not having fun with it anymore.
1466490	1470434	222	B	0.88491	They're like, no, that's not a good thing to do.
1470632	1479794	223	B	0.99324	So it just goes to show that our engagement with magic is mostly a sort of scary play, I think.
1479832	1482526	224	A	1	One thing I just kind of sorry about the seagulls.
1482558	1483574	225	A	1	I don't know if you can hear those.
1483612	1486710	226	A	0.74659	There are seagulls going crazy just outside my window.
1487450	1501526	227	A	1	One thing I would add is, I think, another aspect to this part of the framework wherein you have this value of prediction error, kind of epistemic and effective emotional value of prediction error.
1501558	1513902	228	A	0.99957	It's one of the kind of key elements in this notion of agency get in active inference that I think is really going to be really important to in mind as you go through the further weeks of this course.
1513956	1527822	229	A	0.99998	As well, like I said in the lecture, it's not necessarily speaking to the metaphysical question of free will, but it's certainly moving us away from this picture of the agent as a kind of automaton that's just following rules.
1527886	1532360	230	A	0.99976	There's real space here for kind of individuality and creativity as well.
1534730	1540310	231	A	0.64215	Okay, Darius has been waiting a little while, so let's go over to him.
1540460	1543846	232	Darius	0.91989	Happily patient, happily mean.
1543868	1559420	233	Darius	0.5379	This is this question, I guess, is deriving from my thoughts about the meeting of the high road and the low road, some of the recent work that's been coming out of Maxwell Ramstead and actually a conversation I had with him, which is that the generative model.
1562450	1567006	234	Darius	0.99987	So my question, given that given and.
1567108	1567760	235	Francisco	0.98096	Talk.
1569810	1584002	236	Darius	0.99901	Is regarding the notion of affordances, I think it's natural that as cognitive scientists and philosophers, we take the perspective intuitively of the agent in the agent arena relationship and how the agent is in the business of reducing prediction error.
1584146	1596354	237	Darius	1	I was just wondering whether, as philosophers, you and Mark have thought about what is it like for the whole system to be in the business of reducing its prediction error?
1596402	1598578	238	Darius	0.94901	So I'm interested in flow states.
1598764	1617514	239	Darius	0.5	And so, for example, my thinking is that in a canonical example of a flow state, let's say a rock climber, the climbing wall, is also in the business of reducing its prediction error as to afford the opportunity for it to be exploited stealth or themselves are in the business of reducing prediction error.
1617562	1624500	240	Darius	0.99999	So I'm wondering whether this expansion of affordances is bi directional trial, infinitely directional, better?
1629430	1632020	241	A	0.99619	That's an amazing question.
1633050	1642150	242	A	0.60726	You mentioned Axel constant, but somebody else.
1642220	1642646	243	Darius	0.98939	Someone else.
1642668	1645240	244	Darius	0.97696	But I spoke to Maxwell Ramsey's last week.
1648350	1651210	245	A	0.47843	There's a paper on I'll find it in a second.
1651280	1657462	246	A	0.99502	On niche construction and affordances.
1657526	1660250	247	A	1	I think it's Axel comps.
1662110	1668640	248	A	0.94583	They talk about the kind of the symmetry between a niche and an agent.
1669250	1671634	249	A	0.99996	Very much in the same vein as you were just talking about.
1671672	1685510	250	A	0.99928	There this idea that there's not just this unidirectional kind of fit between the agent and the environment or the niche is actually modeling generative model of the agent as well, implicitly.
1686250	1698250	251	A	0.99923	So I think the best I can do there direction of some really interesting work on that, but certainly it's not something that plays a central role in my thinking recently.
1698590	1698954	252	A	0.83241	Yeah.
1698992	1702650	253	A	0.9984	So we have the participants chat.
1703470	1704220	254	A	0.9311	Yeah.
1704590	1706886	255	A	0.52	A variation approach to niche construction.
1706998	1707274	256	A	0.99234	Yeah.
1707312	1715082	257	A	1	I don't know if Mark has anything to add or anybody else worth thinking about.
1715136	1715798	258	B	0.55408	Yeah.
1715984	1717406	259	B	0.47387	Darius, can I just check one thing?
1717428	1717822	260	B	0.99973	You asked.
1717876	1725006	261	B	1	I don't know how much I need to add here, but did you think that the wall was reducing free energy relative to the climber?
1725038	1725954	262	B	0.7144	Did you say that?
1726072	1726980	263	Darius	0.99784	That's right.
1729270	1731042	264	B	0.89	I don't know how that can that be the case?
1731096	1732280	265	B	0.9937	Can that be the case?
1732650	1739202	266	B	1	The wall as a thing is maintaining itself relative self evidencing.
1739266	1739494	267	H	0.9988	Right?
1739532	1740214	268	B	0.98527	Yeah.
1740412	1742454	269	B	0.72757	But it's not really a duet of one here.
1742492	1749740	270	B	0.70303	It's not like it has a generative model that's deep, where it's modeling the climber, modeling it the same way as tango dancers do.
1750830	1771466	271	B	0.98	A tango duo are having cooperative flow states because each movement opens a vista of possible error, minimizing opportunities for the partner, who in turn opens a vista of error minimizing opportunities for the partner and backwards and forwards into this ever opening expanse of affordance capabilities.
1771578	1774926	272	B	0.9999	But an inanimate object and an agent don't really have that same dynamic.
1774958	1776642	273	B	0.9987	So I was wondering what you were thinking there.
1776776	1786610	274	Darius	0.99968	So my thinking was that this kind of bleeds into the notion of fluidity of affordances in the kind of Gibsonian sense and the fluidity of concepts.
1786690	1794762	275	Darius	0.99977	So I agree in the sense of physical self evidencing, it needs to model the rain, it needs to model the physical environment so as to maintain itself.
1794896	1807498	276	Darius	0.99979	But what about as it's a for it's it's so a sheer rock face is not a climbing wall.
1807584	1812378	277	Darius	1	And that's because it doesn't self evidence as a climbing wall, it doesn't offer the affordances to be climbed.
1812474	1818606	278	Darius	0.99993	That's why I was kind of referring to which is that affordances change based on the agent arena relationship, right.
1818628	1821150	279	Darius	0.99975	Your car's affordances change whether it's working or broken down.
1821220	1825762	280	Darius	0.96968	Similarly, the climbing wall changes whether it's got footholds handholds or whether it's just a sheer rock face.
1825816	1826740	281	Darius	0.99895	That was my thinking.
1827590	1832660	282	B	0.99856	It seems slightly spooky to me that we'd think of the wall as self evidencing in that way.
1833190	1844600	283	B	1	I think the language that we tend to use because Julian Kirsten, Eric Reitfeld, Yelly Brunberg and folks often use the idea of affordances and fields of affordances in the active inference way.
1846250	1865360	284	B	1	The radical end of the pool there is typically that the affordances don't only happen on the agent side, but rather happen from a dynamic of the changing volatile environment and the generative model of the agent and that they're collaborating in dynamic ongoing ways such that the affordances are emergent between them.
1866050	1868142	285	B	0.99999	That certainly seems right to me.
1868276	1875300	286	B	1	The idea to push it a little bit further and think about the wall self evidencing, I think it's a step too spooky for me.
1875750	1891000	287	B	0.99	I think I would feel safer a little bit closer to thinking about the affordances are changing relative to the dynamics of the wall, but I don't know what it would mean for the wall to be evidencing, the climber or itself.
1891450	1922290	288	A	0.93265	Ben that's stirred a couple of thoughts a little longer on the work by affordances because there's this really nice distinction in their work between what they call well, I'm not sure if they I think I think that the term landscape of affordances is a little bit older, but they make this distinction between a landscape of affordances and a field of affordances.
1922710	1935762	289	A	0.51	And I think the reason this is really important to get on the table is because this distinction is kind of directly targeting the dynamic, shifting, very affective nature of affordances.
1935826	1941030	290	A	0.94777	So on the one hand, you have this landscape of affordances that is relatively static.
1941850	1945510	291	A	0.95262	So right now my landscape of affordances is Brighton.
1946250	1953018	292	A	0.97	And the landscape of affordances in that sense is not really going to change very rapidly unless I kind of jump on a plane and go somewhere else.
1953184	1960030	293	A	0.99881	But the field of affordances has this thoroughly kind of normative, affective character to it.
1960180	1970746	294	A	0.99986	So depending on my internal state at any given time, depending on my expectations or my desires, say, my field of affordances is going to shift very rapidly.
1970938	1976066	295	A	0.54976	So not just predicated on my internal state, but also kind of contextual cues as well.
1976168	1984710	296	A	0.99321	So if something were to happen in the environment that was afforded very high precision weight in, then that's likely to shift my field of affordances significantly.
1986570	2008154	297	A	1	I think that the reason that I'm kind of emphasizing this to Darius's point is and kind of building on what Mark said, it doesn't seem like this distinction at least would apply from the perspective of the wall, say, because this kind of affectivity and normativity just isn't a feature of the wall's experience of the world.
2008272	2011482	298	A	0.99	And also to kind of run with affordances.
2011626	2014926	299	A	0.89192	Perhaps you could say a bit more about how you would kind of think about this.
2014948	2023594	300	A	0.99621	Darius because affordances are kind of opportunities for to.
2023652	2033150	301	A	0.99997	There's some debate about this, but I like to think of them as like a relational property between you have the skilled capabilities of an embodied agent and then you have some feature of the environment.
2033310	2038854	302	A	0.99997	So I think when you're thinking from the perspective of the wall, you have the features of the environment because you.
2038892	2043522	303	A	1	Have the embodied characteristics of the agent are kind of playing that role.
2043666	2048506	304	A	1	But it's not clear to me what the kind of skilled capabilities of the wall is.
2048608	2051226	305	A	0.76297	So yeah, if you could just say a bit more about that.
2051408	2059450	306	Darius	0.9886	Yeah, I mean, it may be the case, as you pointed out, that actually the technical term affordance as being opportunities for action is misplaced.
2061390	2080370	307	Darius	0.65954	This is a lot of this I've been formulating, having read this very new paper by Ramsey and colleagues on Bayesian mechanics of physics of and by beliefs, where he really rams home this point, that the system, the generative model is the system of the kind of stochastic differential equations across the state space.
2080440	2085398	308	Darius	0.72457	So across the Marko blanca, across the particle with its Marko blanket and the external states.
2085564	2091638	309	Darius	1	And that is the system which is in that system itself is in the business of reducing free energy.
2091724	2098282	310	Darius	0.99984	So it's not just the active inference agent, it's the whole system which is embedded in a whole system of other things.
2098336	2110446	311	Darius	1	And so that was my general thinking, is that just on the prerequisite that these systems exist just on that a prior axiom, there has to be some kind of self evidencing of that system itself.
2110548	2112640	312	Darius	0.99985	So maybe affordance is the wrong word.
2114850	2116142	313	B	0.99998	That might be the trick right there.
2116196	2120538	314	B	0.99997	As soon as you provoke affordance, you're provoking phenomenology.
2120634	2123582	315	B	1	And so now we're not talking just about statistical variations.
2123646	2125460	316	B	1	Now we're talking about lived experience.
2126310	2128994	317	B	0.99846	That might be the linchpin right there, I think.
2129112	2130034	318	A	0.99	I think that is right.
2130072	2130418	319	A	0.98622	Yeah.
2130504	2136858	320	A	1	And I would say I think, Darius, you're absolutely on the right track and there is this ambiguity about affordances.
2136894	2148154	321	A	0.99968	But aside from that, I think you're absolutely mean it's just nonsensical to think about an agent absent an environment under active to.
2148352	2152860	322	A	0.62255	It is this agent environment system in its totality that's minimizing free energy.
2153310	2154986	323	A	0.99982	They have to be taken together as one.
2155008	2158366	324	A	0.99	And I know Avel, you've had your hand up for a little while there.
2158468	2160080	325	A	0.97578	Is there something you wanted to add?
2162050	2162798	326	H	0.71	Yes.
2162964	2163886	327	H	0.60578	Do you hear me?
2163908	2165230	328	A	0.98453	Well, we do.
2165300	2166126	329	A	0.98	I do anyway.
2166228	2177070	330	H	0.68552	Okay, so about the afferences world having afferences and basically the symmetry of agents and environment is a property of active inference.
2177150	2179038	331	H	0.95906	Well, of the frenzy principle.
2179214	2193106	332	H	0.99946	So if you buy the frenzy principle and you also buy that it entails that agent have affordances or any approximal notion, then you also buy that walls have affordances.
2193298	2197100	333	H	0.99977	So there are basically three position you can have on that.
2198030	2200746	334	H	1	One is that active inference is correct.
2200848	2205900	335	H	0.70021	Wall are fucking affordances and they do self evidencing, which I would not go with.
2206450	2213038	336	H	0.99559	Another option is that you have basically devolved in the detail.
2213124	2217358	337	H	0.99647	So, for example, maybe the adjunct environment is not the wall.
2217444	2223058	338	H	0.92279	It's something that is broader, like Gaia system, whatever, and it just happens.
2223144	2226562	339	H	0.99772	It includes the wall, but it is not the wall.
2226616	2229010	340	H	0.99	And it does do self balancing.
2229830	2232774	341	H	1	And the third is that active inference is wrong.
2232972	2239030	342	H	0.99998	We don't have affordances based on whatever is the formal presentation of active inference.
2239450	2247402	343	H	1	And I would go in that direction of this phenomenology stuff.
2247456	2255334	344	H	0.99595	So we have, I would say, philosophical evidence in the sense that denying this would lead to nonsense.
2255382	2263198	345	H	0.99998	But information is based on observation, and some system do observing much more actively than others.
2263364	2265946	346	H	1	And maybe it's a good thing to have in your formalism.
2266058	2268400	347	H	0.5211	I'd say so.
2269190	2286726	348	H	0.96732	You have maybe a stronger case for the way phenomenology affordances are constructed in the quantum formulation of the FEP, if there is such a thing, which, like Chris Fields, someone who we should baseline believe claims there is.
2286908	2298486	349	H	0.99989	Because then you have formalization which is not in terms of dynamics per se, so causal constraints, but observation and indirectly phenomenology.
2298598	2300522	350	H	0.99996	Maybe you have something that is stronger there.
2300576	2334210	351	H	0.99789	But right now, the link sorry, there is actually a bunch of people who have a quite good hold on science, which are the ecological activity and cognition on one hand and between cognition and the metabolism, the constitution of the living thing that cognites on the other and one of their definition of agency cognition.
2334290	2341480	352	H	0.62518	Pick one entails interactional, asymmetry I think is the word.
2346670	2357530	353	H	0.69788	That is something we would need to translate into active inference, well into the FEP for active inference to have a strong grip over this affordancing.
2358030	2362046	354	H	0.99978	Until then, we have a kind of handwriting way.
2362068	2369950	355	H	0.473	It relates it to more conceptual approaches that are related to an active and ecological approach to psychology.
2370110	2377460	356	H	0.98	And, yeah, the formalism lags basically behind the concept for now.
2378230	2380260	357	H	0.99998	Sorry for the long talk.
2381690	2382758	358	A	0.9868	No, that was great.
2382844	2383990	359	A	0.99985	Much appreciated.
2387210	2390834	360	A	0.99936	Anybody else want to come in on a question of affordances?
2390882	2396410	361	A	0.99506	Because I know affordance has played a fairly substantial role in the lecture.
2403870	2412080	362	A	0.95574	Anybody has any questions related to affordances or action perception affordances, then now's the time.
2413090	2417678	363	Francisco	0.55911	Yeah, I do have one, but it's not well structured yet.
2417844	2418960	364	A	0.62624	That's really fine.
2420130	2430094	365	Francisco	0.98381	Something that I've been thinking about for the last month because I started to depend on artificial intelligence field coming from a humanities background and philosophical background.
2430142	2441602	366	Francisco	0.99991	So I'm mixing many things in this period, mainly following the active inference as a crossroad between many disciplines, and this is very beautiful about the framework.
2441746	2467418	367	Francisco	0.98	And I was super curious about the question proposed by Darius, and I was then thinking about now we're actually facing a new environment and a new landscape in which we're interacting with actually generating over revolutionary time and synchronizing over evolution.
2467594	2475406	368	A	0.50102	Technological alien agencies operating within our landscape and field of affordances.
2475518	2481090	369	A	0.96897	So I think there's a lot of really interesting work to potentially be done there.
2481160	2503980	370	A	0.68	I will take the opportunity to shamelessly plug a preprint that Mark and I have released recently, where one thing that I'm really interested in, that I can kind of speak with some confidence on is the fact that I do think there's a point at which the theory of affordances or the language of affordances, starts to break down to.
2507410	2515002	371	A	0.99908	So the preprint I'll share around is looking at ambient technology specifically.
2515066	2524626	372	A	0.99994	So this is technology that the whole kind of impetus behind its design and conceptualization is that the user doesn't have to actually do anything.
2524808	2528062	373	A	0.99994	So it precedes the user Pragmatically and epistemically.
2528126	2532354	374	A	0.99998	It knows what kinds of things you want it to do, and it just does them in the background.
2532482	2541480	375	A	1	And it works by shifting kind of it subtly shifts the material environment such that it impacts your field of affordances in real time.
2542890	2562122	376	A	1	And the argument that we make in that paper is essentially that the affordances approach doesn't really work for this and that we need to kind of think again, I think that that might be how to conceptualize generative AI, for example, under the affordances framework.
2562266	2566720	377	A	1	I don't know of anybody that's done any work on that, but it would certainly make a really cool project.
2570090	2572440	378	H	0.98859	You are making it right now.
2573770	2574840	379	A	0.98358	What's that?
2576410	2578246	380	H	0.99998	You are making it right now.
2578268	2580840	381	H	0.55	I know because you sent me the paper to review.
2581450	2582520	382	A	0.99	Oh, yeah.
2584910	2585820	383	Francisco	0.94333	Thank you.
2590030	2594914	384	A	0.99077	Early stages of a paper on the role of generative AI in classrooms.
2595062	2614210	385	A	0.99107	So, from the perspective of thinking about what kinds of affordance does generative AI represent in a learning environment, particularly, we're kind of applying active inference to classroom design and looking at it from the angles of different educational and pedagogical theories.
2614630	2617700	386	A	0.99987	But it's very early days.
2620070	2623122	387	A	0.67289	It probably depends on your view of generative II in general.
2623176	2627640	388	A	1	I mean, it depends whether you would consider it a real cognitive agent or not.
2628490	2641162	389	A	1	I think some people are more inclined to think of it as this is a thing that has agency, it has real understanding, and other people are maybe less inclined to think of it in those terms.
2641216	2645580	390	A	1	And I think that might bear significantly on how you think of it.
2646930	2647966	391	Francisco	0.99963	Yeah, that's super cool.
2647988	2655514	392	Francisco	0.69386	That basically the last project you mentioned is very in line with my PhD project right now because my main PhD.
2655562	2665410	393	Francisco	0.9998	Project is our European foundings, and it's about the AI for personalized education, and I'm trying to follow it through the active inference framework from a multi level perspective.
2667350	2668130	394	A	0.73651	Very cool.
2668200	2670500	395	A	0.95143	Yeah, we should we should probably talk more about that.
2673690	2674342	396	A	0.62905	Okay.
2674476	2675350	397	A	0.80298	Darius.
2677930	2678294	398	B	0.99296	Yeah?
2678332	2691820	399	Darius	1	I wanted to ask I mean, this may be directed more mark so I know this is kind of his work in terms of slopes of uncertainty and about doing better than expected at reducing prediction error over time.
2692350	2713602	400	Darius	1	I was wondering kind of how the architecture of that is built into the particle, into the generative model because we have the kind of for me, I don't know if it's an hour and out sort of conflict, but we have these kind of implicit priors that we're going to fulfill certain expectations or minimize prediction error regarding certain things.
2713656	2713826	401	H	0.99246	Right.
2713848	2718850	402	Darius	0.99996	So homeostatic priors or happiness, well being, whatever it is.
2719000	2731958	403	Darius	0.99998	But then your claim is that we have the higher order beliefs, the higher order predictions that over and above, that I also need to do well, better than expected at reducing prediction error over time.
2732124	2735434	404	Darius	0.5245	So it's still quite fuzzy in my mind.
2735472	2751002	405	Darius	0.99996	But is there a kind of potential conflict there between the general priors that the system has and then actually, in a sense, violating those expectations by going over and above them, which itself constitutes an expectation?
2751066	2754110	406	Darius	0.99919	How do you kind of resolve that tension?
2755810	2760366	407	B	0.998	Yeah, that's interesting, but this is very much in Ben's wheelhouse too.
2760468	2786146	408	B	0.92082	Ben and I have been working on sloppy stuff for almost as long as I've been doing on his original paper called We'll Get It Up.
2786168	2792500	409	B	0.99973	They do a really good job of showing technically where this sits within a deep parametric model.
2793430	2806278	410	B	0.72038	Lara Senved Smith's paper on metacognition also does this by showing you have these depths of modeling where models above are modeling models below, and optimizing over those models below.
2806364	2817100	411	B	0.99994	So we have some good computational backbone for thinking, for not only thinking that this is the case, but beginning to express how it does the work it does.
2817630	2826830	412	B	0.99967	So let's leave that for digging into it, though, technically, sort of on our own, let me say sort of at a higher, more abstract level still, hopefully it's useful.
2827490	2844462	413	B	0.99957	It's not weird to think that this kind of anticipatory system is not only making predictions about the world, but it's also part of what it's predicting is how fast or slow, how efficient it is in particular contexts at resolving certain kinds of errors.
2844606	2849990	414	B	0.99996	That's a perfectly fine thing to think that we're also predicting slopes of engagement.
2851050	2860634	415	B	1	And then all we're saying then is system also pays attention to when those expectations are breached and it's learning from those breaches that should just be the bread and butter for what the system does anyway.
2860752	2882318	416	B	0.99973	So precision is a second order process in much the same way precision is about how reliable are lower level predictions and then using that amount to toggle how impactful either errors or predictions are.
2882404	2897860	417	B	0.99996	So we've already got baked into the system, right from early days, this idea that the system is not only making predictions, but monitoring its own predictive processing regimes and then toggling based on how reliable those substreams are.
2898310	2915100	418	B	1	All we're adding here is when we first thought about those mechanisms, one thing that can happen, this is just good for everybody who's interested in active inference, because I bump into this with my students all the time when we say something like precision weighting, a tendency to think of thing.
2916830	2924566	419	B	0.99996	So we go to find this precision like where's the biological or precision weighting?
2924598	2932414	420	B	0.79889	But when we actually get into a biosystem and we look for these things, the truth is precision is going to be weighted in lots of different ways.
2932452	2939086	421	B	1	I mean, that's the real frontier of this research is to actually find how these things are instantiated and the answer is going to be multifarious.
2939118	2943138	422	B	0.99	I mean, you're going to have precision adjustments happening throughout the system in lots of ways.
2943224	2947042	423	B	0.98316	It could be synchrony and asynchronous and desynchronies between systems.
2947106	2953842	424	B	0.52834	It can be neuromodulatory chemicals, it can be structural shapes within the brain.
2953906	2957718	425	B	1	I mean, precision is going to be set in lots of different ways.
2957884	2983486	426	B	0.53821	So all that we're pointing out here is that one of the ways that precision is being set, one of the ways that the system is tracking how efficient it is and then upping or lowering the amount of impact error signals or predictions have, is that it's happening in an embodied way.
2983588	2994690	427	B	0.99992	So we've looked over to the effective search and lo and behold, there are all these signatures that we were looking for for this part of the machinery.
2996470	3000394	428	B	0.91342	So not weird that the system is tracking its own regularities and adjusting.
3000462	3002338	429	B	0.99998	That was baked in right from the beginning.
3002514	3005826	430	B	0.9996	How it does that, that's one of the frontiers.
3005858	3007654	431	B	0.99981	It's going to happen in lots of different ways.
3007772	3008594	432	B	0.9945	Lo and behold.
3008642	3027898	433	B	0.99984	Affect the dynamics, the shoe fits, they look like they do that stuff and then you bring it to the lab and you go back to like reward prediction error research and sure enough, neuromodulatory chemicals, reward systems are tuning affective dynamics relative to better than and worse than slopes of uncertainty management.
3027994	3031760	434	B	0.72531	It's exactly what we would expect given the computational model.
3032290	3046242	435	B	0.99992	So then it was an easy next step to start saying, well look, there's one of the ways that precision, there's one of the ways that affect system.
3046376	3051554	436	B	1	Now just notice there it's the only precision, it's not the only thing the affected system is doing.
3051592	3057570	437	B	0.57528	We never want to say we're careful not to be reductionist to say, oh, affect is always aerodynamics.
3057650	3058678	438	B	1	I don't think that's right.
3058764	3070390	439	B	1	I think it's that aerodynamics are expressed in part effectively and they have this impact on the system that we've known about for a long time, even from just the reward prediction error literature.
3070550	3073340	440	B	0.99996	Does that help or was that a bit is that okay?
3074190	3074940	441	Darius	0.99978	Yeah.
3078370	3083950	442	A	0.99966	Just to add two things really quickly there because I know time is kind of catching up with us.
3084020	3097586	443	A	1	I would emphasize as well, just as a kind of general .1 of the things I really like about the work on aerodynamics and affect is it has this nice kind of broad capture of the kinds of affectivity that agents can experience.
3097688	3106934	444	A	0.99649	So when we talk about affectivity, we're not just talking about full blooded emotions or even just moods, but we're talking about what?
3107052	3121142	445	A	1	One of the things I kind of drew attention to in the lecture was Matthew Ratcliffe's work on existential feelings, which I think is just such the connection between active inference and phenomenology that you find in some of this work is just insanely powerful.
3121206	3133626	446	A	1	And it's one of the things that really drew me into the framework the second thing, just building one thing that I don't think I mentioned in the lecture is active inference.
3133738	3138190	447	A	0.77939	It has been described as a quintessentially metacognitive framework.
3138350	3154534	448	A	0.99998	So you have kind of built into the architecture, you have expectations over expect, so you have kind of predictions about predictions and this has proved to be just, again, just phenomenally useful for thinking about certain aspects of phenomenology as well.
3154572	3159590	449	A	0.81738	So yeah, I think that these are like real strengths of the framework.
3165140	3171600	450	A	0.97611	Okay, I don't know how we're doing for time.
3171750	3174256	451	A	0.99997	Are we strictly limited on or can.
3174278	3177190	452	H	0.50934	We we are not as far as I know.
3177800	3178980	453	H	0.41742	Daniel.
3181480	3187270	454	A	0.99981	Well, I can probably do I definitely do another 15 if anybody has any more questions.
3187640	3193284	455	A	1	And people, I should say as well, that doesn't mean that we're all held captive to my time frame.
3193332	3202620	456	A	0.99989	So if people do need to leave within the next five or ten minutes, that's absolutely fine, but I'm certainly happy to carry on if anybody has any more questions or comments.
3207060	3229796	457	G	0.99995	If no one else has got any, I would quite like to go back to earlier in the discussion you were talking about the value of uncertainty because in organizations in which I'm working with, we often have conversations about uncertainty and what we find is over time there tends to be a drift towards risk aversion.
3229908	3242312	458	G	0.84731	So we're working with a large international construction company at the Minute, and they used to have a culture in which innovation was quite well embedded.
3242376	3270900	459	G	0.54	And over time, it's kind of drifted towards very, very risk averse culture where actually, rather than learning through the process and being able to tolerate uncertainty around opportunities and what can be accomplished and that kind of surveillance that comes with the intrinsic reward, I suppose, of being able to reduce uncertainty about capabilities to a situation where they're trying to anticipate all of the risks upfront before they even get involved in the project.
3270970	3273616	460	G	0.87036	So there's some kind of valence switch.
3273728	3289184	461	G	0.99	Mark and you mentioned David Blaine earlier and something about the context there was a switch in valence from yeah, this is a kind of a play, this is a safe thing to do, to actually know this has real consequences.
3289332	3297100	462	G	0.99583	So I'd like to explore that a little bit more actually, if anyone's got kind of any insights or papers or comments.
3300000	3303090	463	A	0.99741	Yeah, I think that's a really interesting question, actually.
3304900	3317380	464	A	0.62234	It seems like one of the things we've been talking about is this connection between uncertainty, prediction, error, minimization and affectivity in individual agents.
3317450	3324576	465	A	1	And it sounds like what you're asking is how does that translate to collectives?
3324688	3338360	466	A	0.99885	So one of the things about active inference that we're going to see in subsequent weeks is how it scales up to kind of larger systems like companies or groups that are trying to achieve some kind of shared goal.
3339820	3344764	467	A	0.93611	How does the value of uncertainty translate onto how is it scalable in that sense?
3344802	3345390	468	A	0.76617	Right?
3345760	3347470	469	A	0.95366	Would that be a fair kind of.
3348640	3350430	470	G	0.99991	Yeah, I guess so.
3355940	3366388	471	G	0.54731	Uncertainty often when it's talked about uncertainty is talked about as risk, which is, I suppose, is predictions or anticipation of outcomes that we don't want.
3366474	3366916	472	Darius	0.99459	Right.
3367018	3375824	473	G	0.99886	Whereas there's also positive uncertainty, which is, I suppose, simply stated opportunities through curiosity.
3375952	3388600	474	G	0.99998	What might we be able to achieve this kind of novelty seeking, I guess that new opportunities that we haven't exploited, and they're just in the kind of organizational systems.
3389500	3405570	475	G	1	I think there are various pressures that cause it, but over time, you see these cultural shifts towards a very kind of risk averse where the valence is obviously quite negative, quite an unpleasant feeling for people.
3407780	3408928	476	B	0.72365	Yeah, this is good.
3409014	3411090	477	B	1	This is right at the heart of my current work.
3411620	3412608	478	B	0.99997	I'm really interested.
3412694	3421136	479	B	0.99944	So we just had a big stint where active inference models were starting to be used in computational psychiatry, especially for pathological disorders.
3421248	3425780	480	B	0.9999	So addiction, depression, disassociative disorders, OCD PTSD.
3427800	3435096	481	B	0.99871	It's quite a sexy framework for thinking about some of the ways that the cognitive system breaks down and the sort of new move right now.
3435118	3437860	482	B	0.71	I mean, we have a collection coming out right now in Neuroscience of Consciousness.
3437940	3456168	483	B	0.59093	Is to think about these things in terms of, okay, if we are predictive systems and we have a sufficiently rich model of how that system works in a particular niche, what sorts of ways can we intervene on that system in order to have positive outcomes, rather than just modeling what the negative outcomes are?
3456274	3458224	484	B	0.99	And I hear that a lot in what you're saying now.
3458262	3460976	485	B	0.98901	So I'm just going to drop one link for you there.
3461078	3467948	486	B	0.99961	This is Casper Hess again wrote a very small paper with a nice little model called Sophisticated Affective Inference.
3468044	3473670	487	B	0.22277	Here's a little bot that tends towards catastrophe catastrophizing the future.
3474760	3480100	488	B	0.99999	If it's given like, fun medium fun medium fun dangerous.
3480260	3485850	489	B	1	Over time, it tends to expect the dangerous one.
3487100	3497260	490	B	0.99853	Like after 10,000 iterations, it basically lives in the worst possible scenario, which is a nice little this is my wife, this is most people today.
3497410	3504724	491	B	0.99997	So the question is, I want to know, given the model, why does that happen and what can we be doing to intervene?
3504872	3511644	492	B	1	And part of the answer is going to be we need to become more tolerant of uncertainty.
3511692	3514384	493	B	0.99998	That's one of the things that the system can be better or worse at.
3514502	3520020	494	B	0.99995	So this just takes the computational modeling and then looks to things that we already know about emotional regulation.
3520760	3522310	495	B	0.99989	That's part of the story.
3523480	3533336	496	B	0.71308	So we've done a little bit of work on this with our predictive dynamics of happiness and wellbeing, and Ryan Smith is definitely doing work on this with active inference and well being.
3533518	3536810	497	B	0.98415	So definitely check that out if you're interested here.
3538540	3544860	498	B	0.8666	I'll just flag one interesting thing here that relates just to what we were just talking about, about layers of modeling.
3545600	3548316	499	B	0.66	One way that let's say two ways.
3548418	3550776	500	B	0.99995	There's two ways that a system, and it's probably going to be lots.
3550808	3556988	501	B	0.99992	But the two that come to mind that a system can become more tolerant to uncertainty is one exposure.
3557164	3561440	502	B	0.99983	So this is why exposure therapy might be useful for our kind of a system.
3561590	3569268	503	B	0.99999	You want to expose the system to volatility at the lower and middle levels of the hierarchy and have it turn out okay.
3569434	3579588	504	B	0.98495	So that one of the things that the system can come to predict is not only particular outcomes, but it can also predict how much error is involved in particular outcomes.
3579684	3595256	505	B	0.99059	So, for instance, when I used to give a pro talk, I was always really nervous, and I don't know if that ever really went away, but I've had so much exposure to the anxiety of giving a professional talk that basically I don't notice it anymore.
3595288	3600488	506	B	0.99751	But if you were to ask me at the beginning of my talk, mark right now, what's your phenomenology?
3600664	3604536	507	B	0.79	And I sort of meditatively looked, I'd probably say, yeah, I'm nervous.
3604648	3607052	508	B	0.99883	But if you hadn't have said that and you were just like, hey, what's up?
3607106	3608720	509	B	0.54131	I've been like, oh yeah, I'm great.
3608870	3609424	510	B	0.99995	It's all good.
3609462	3610588	511	B	1	I don't even notice it anymore.
3610684	3617828	512	B	0.99987	That's because the system knows that I have errors go up, but as soon as I start talking, they drop away.
3617914	3622256	513	B	1	And because I know the arc that even error in the system, it becomes non newsworthy.
3622288	3626288	514	B	0.98102	It's no longer interesting volatility to be tracking that's just from exposure.
3626464	3634596	515	B	0.99892	So what's happening is you're having errors at a lower or middle level that a higher level is now modeling, saying when we come here, we should expect this arc of error.
3634628	3639370	516	B	0.99995	Same thing when you work out like real gym rats, they can feel good.
3642400	3655360	517	B	0.95449	You're having your system right, but at the higher level, it's now learned not only that that has a natural arc, but that that's a good sign at a higher level.
3655430	3662976	518	B	0.99032	So now you're getting positive prediction error slope high and negative prediction error slope low.
3663158	3666160	519	B	0.66836	Okay, so one exposure.
3666320	3669840	520	B	0.72	Two, you can model your own responses.
3669920	3672900	521	B	0.61219	This is something Ben and I work on with horror movies.
3675800	3682900	522	B	0.99972	You can take an active role in mindfully observing your own reactions to volatility.
3683060	3685956	523	B	0.99	And this comes up in our paper on horror.
3685988	3688120	524	B	0.77708	We've already dropped the link today if you want to check it out.
3688190	3692232	525	B	0.99999	Something really special happens when the system models its own reaction to volatility.
3692376	3703536	526	B	0.99995	It starts to learn that even reactions to volatility, they don't need to be compounded up into dangers, that it's okay to be uncertain at certain levels of the system.
3703718	3711650	527	B	0.99959	So how that translates into business, I'm not sure, other than I know tolerance to uncertainty is a marker of business success.
3712180	3722100	528	B	1	And I suspect the framework in a fit with lots of mindfulness work about learning to tolerate uncertainty.
3722440	3728932	529	G	0.99868	Is there anything about the role of language in kind of modulating those metacognitive?
3729076	3730024	530	B	0.99	Oh, it's good.
3730142	3736170	531	H	0.98342	If I may, I was preparing an answer on that specifically, and I was nervously waiting for opportunity.
3736540	3737530	532	A	0.53296	Sorry, Mark.
3742400	3753708	533	H	0.63884	Meta in terms of evolutionary cognitive archaeology, we don't know when language emerge, but we do know that, let's say an encouraging semantic system.
3753794	3760400	534	H	0.99395	So you can build things in language, and you can expect things in the world to correspond to things in language.
3760820	3775924	535	H	0.99979	So, for example, if you that's abstract, as I say, it's abstract, but you can, for example, have a self identity, and I'm a French, and I communicate with the expectation that are embedded in that identity with other people.
3776042	3777844	536	H	0.91	And that means we communicate over norms.
3777892	3781656	537	H	0.99895	So we have specific expectation of what we will do.
3781838	3788280	538	H	1	And those expectations, they become embedded in specific symbolic markers that are embedded in language.
3788960	3814240	539	H	0.7	And something that the thing that it was strongly evoked in my mind when you talked of tolerance to insecurity is that as far as documented history goes, Europeans well, Indo Europeans, they are pretty strong on the idea that things have a nature and they act lawfully.
3814680	3819760	540	H	0.89	And their nature and their laws, they somehow correspond to linguistic categories.
3819920	3829240	541	H	0.99991	So I can say stuff like chickens quack, and that's a proper explanation of what are chicken and why they quack.
3829980	3839536	542	H	0.71	And if you look in Chinese philosophy, as far as written history goes, you have a much accent on Wei Wu Wei.
3839588	3845100	543	H	0.9997	So a poor translation would be effortless action.
3846400	3850296	544	H	0.99669	Closer translation would be action without action.
3850488	3864790	545	H	0.99958	So it's something that is quite close to the phenomenology of flow in that you observe yourself doing things and you do not apply a conscious effort to the flow of what you're doing.
3865560	3871332	546	H	1	And that looks like something that is closer to the phenomenology you'd expect.
3871386	3898156	547	H	1	If you apply recursive preactive cognition with less or less heavy or more effectively integrated symbolic concurring like use of language as something that you actually expect to be meaningful and to constrain strongly your actions and marginally, I'd expect, very strongly expect that linguistic categories will map and what you build with it.
3898178	3903420	548	H	0.99972	So, I don't know, self identities, plans, whatever will map cleanly onto what you observe.
3903500	3907570	549	H	0.9999	You will be very anxious about things, because that does not happen usually.
3910020	3924676	550	H	0.96	And yeah, besides grand discourse on interpret traits, which are usually not that constructive sorry, I got lost because I did.
3924698	3930330	551	B	0.93388	Not let me just say one thing before we move off this point.
3931340	3935396	552	B	1	A simple way that language might help is by invoking cognitive flexibility.
3935508	3942844	553	B	0.99975	So oftentimes we think about the management of error being either updating predictions or acting on the world.
3943042	3944072	554	B	0.96415	That's the dyad.
3944136	3951868	555	B	1	Usually what it overlooks is the third one, which is we can also manage volatility by redeploying precision in a better way.
3952034	3963264	556	B	0.99995	So rather than just updating your model to fit the world or updating the world to fit your model, you can just change the set of what matters so that you're not really updating the model and you're not really changing the world.
3963302	3965308	557	B	0.99999	You're just changing the problem landscape.
3965404	3967620	558	B	1	And that's something language allows us to do.
3967690	3976832	559	B	0.69979	It's maybe one of the really amazing things that language allows us to do is we can use language to bootstrap that kind of precision adjustment.
3976896	3980744	560	B	0.99997	So if the train doesn't come on time, we both notice it.
3980782	3980984	561	B	0.97715	Okay.
3981022	3983492	562	B	1	And we feel bad that's perceptual updating.
3983636	3987044	563	B	0.99999	We might go and get a taxi that's active updating.
3987172	3996776	564	B	0.99974	But I might just say to you, wow, look, isn't it lovely that now we get a little bit more time to read our book or to continue our conversation or let's finish our coffee with a little bit of ease.
3996808	3998060	565	B	1	I mean, we get an extra 20 minutes.
3998130	4002012	566	B	1	Now even just saying that redeploys precision over the problem.
4002066	4006690	567	B	0.99998	Space now the train being late isn't volatility in the system.
4007220	4011836	568	B	1	The train being late is signaling to the system that a better than expected slope has been achieved.
4012028	4013136	569	B	0.99816	Isn't that so interesting?
4013238	4018896	570	B	1	The exact same occurrence is either undigestible volatility, right, like you're going to be late.
4018928	4019600	571	B	1	Oh my goodness.
4019680	4026676	572	B	0.99993	Or it's an opportunity for an improvement in the system, which is now you get more time with the person that you're taking the train with.
4026778	4034552	573	B	1	And that was just a matter of linguistic perturbance of the way that precision is being looking at.
4034606	4042750	574	B	0.98121	If you wanted to dig into the research here, I would look up cognitive flexibility and language or coaching cognitive flexibility is such a good point here.
4045520	4050952	575	H	0.81207	So you have a paper by Nick Clark on this specific encouraging role of language.
4051016	4062876	576	H	1	And something it entails is that basically you get like if the active infrastructure is correct, you flexibly predict a flow in the interoceptive proprioceptive exteriorceptive.
4062908	4064864	577	H	0.97107	Is that even a thing space?
4065062	4071344	578	H	1	And that is what builds an integrated experience and integrated cognition and language.
4071392	4073024	579	H	0.99968	It adds another layer of complexity.
4073072	4081016	580	H	0.99987	If you can just talk to yourself in your head, that is another dimension that you can predict and that can be coherent or incoherent with your world.
4081198	4091228	581	H	1	And so that is an extremely powerful encouraging system because I just have to tell a plan to myself and boom, that pushes me, nudges me nicely throughout the plan.
4091314	4097144	582	H	0.99997	But then you can have a different level of meta expectation over how language corresponds to reality.
4097192	4109664	583	H	1	And I'd say a very strong factor of aversion to uncertainty is whether you expect your plans or your linguistic structure to nicely map onto reality because it will not happen.
4109782	4115036	584	H	0.60551	But if you expect strongly that it will be the case, you will have to make it happen somehow.
4115148	4124292	585	H	1	And here you will adapt rigid strategies and you will lose flexibility, but also language necessary for flexibility to be the case in the first place.
4124346	4127960	586	H	0.99687	So it's about coupling between dimension of cognition.
4130540	4130856	587	A	0.99965	Yeah.
4130878	4141256	588	A	0.81	And I would just kind of risk and danger are two things that I've been really interested in across a kind of variety of different contexts.
4141288	4145548	589	A	1	And I would say some of the.
4145554	4161152	590	A	0.99997	Things that have been said like how you can influence the system by externalizing things through language and the different strategies that systems, whatever scale they're on, have minimizing prediction error, minimizing free energy.
4161286	4165344	591	A	1	But also I would just emphasize the importance of external context here as well.
4165382	4172432	592	A	0.99999	So even in the case of a collective like a business, you still have to take into account the environment in which the business is operating.
4172496	4177100	593	A	0.62	And I've been really interested in a particularly extreme example of context.
4177280	4199020	594	A	1	I used to still do some work in philosophy of sport and I've been really interested in dangerous sports and why there seems to be this insane contextual effect where within a very kind of narrow contextual band of sporting practice, people seem willing to take on risks that outside of that context would just be completely insane.
4199680	4215620	595	A	1	And I think this is something that's probably going to come up again in subsequent weeks as well here when we talk about the way that expectations on an individual or a collective basis can be set through other minds.
4219400	4223012	596	A	0.96175	So what somebody else expect myself to do?
4223146	4224710	597	A	0.97	And so on and so on.
4226120	4227780	598	A	0.99764	Darius, you've had your hand up a while.
4227850	4229112	599	A	0.91952	Do you want to jump in?
4229246	4229960	600	Darius	1	Yes, please.
4230030	4236760	601	Darius	0.99068	I'm not sure this is the sort of grand synthesis of any of this, but flow was mentioned.
4236830	4243596	602	Darius	0.99999	As I said, it's a kind of pet topic of mine and something that.
4243618	4245192	603	A	0.99999	We know about flow.
4245256	4262268	604	Darius	1	And this is why it's integrated into this idea of language and agency, is that at least in its original conception, success, mahali, and the sort of qualitative experience associated with flow, you would find stuff like not only the dilation of time, but also the reduction in self consciousness.
4262444	4271188	605	Darius	0.99	And now this is sort of picking up a lot of work that happens at UCL and people like Jeremy Skipper how integrated language is into the sense of self.
4271354	4290510	606	Darius	0.99	And it seems to me, and this is kind of shooting from the hip, that all of these very deep rooted, I guess they're kind of psychotechnologies the self language seem to dissipate at this goldilocks zone, at this point of at this edge of criticality, at this flow state.
4291040	4307068	607	Darius	0.99999	Which makes me think if the flow state is a phenomenological offshoot of being optimally reducing prediction error, what is the kind of role of the concept of the self or linguistic functions?
4307244	4313250	608	Darius	0.99936	Because it seems to me that that becomes a regulatory function when that optimality is reduced, when stuff starts going wrong.
4313940	4319408	609	Darius	0.99336	So I think you can also think about this in the kind of Heideggerian or draythe's sense of just opening a door.
4319504	4321988	610	Darius	0.9999	You only start to represent the door in yourself.
4322154	4326740	611	Darius	0.99988	You only give it the linguistic object of a door when you can't open it.
4326810	4330884	612	Darius	0.99947	When you open a door standard, there is no representation going there.
4330922	4332952	613	Darius	0.99	I mean, you could even argue there's no qualia there.
4333006	4346328	614	Darius	0.99986	So I'm wondering how deep that runs and what we can say about the role of agency, selfhood, maybe even consciousness because they don't seem to be that prevalent, at least from my understanding.
4346504	4348700	615	Darius	1	When we are at the edge of criticality.
4349360	4357390	616	A	1	The suggestion you're making there is it sounds like what you're saying that these things you call them psychotenologies, which I really like.
4357760	4362604	617	A	0.70831	Like language, like certain aspects of self modeling.
4362652	4381480	618	A	0.99993	They are a kind of scaffolding or like a ladder that you then kind of gets kicked away once you reach a certain kind of edge of criticality, like where the performance becomes I don't know what you're performing at such a level that you just don't need those scaffolding.
4382060	4382664	619	Darius	0.9961	Yeah.
4382782	4393800	620	Darius	0.6524	Or the self regulatory mechanisms that we harness when we're not in flow are linguistic or agentic in essence.
4393880	4401340	621	Darius	1	And you don't need that when you're at this edge of criticality.
4402820	4410944	622	Darius	0.67	And I only postulate that because I'm only thinking, how deep does that go?
4411142	4416868	623	Darius	0.99973	Because I know, obviously the active inference framework is trying to tackle in some ways the hard problem as well.
4417034	4431496	624	Darius	0.95	And there are some flotations of the idea, at least within the flow community, about the kind of I don't want to say elimination, but the moderation, the modulation of qualia under flow states.
4431678	4445708	625	Darius	0.99855	So could we also consider that to be a construct which happens when we're not necessarily optimally producing prediction error, a couple of things.
4445794	4451348	626	A	0.40416	So I'm certainly not the person to stop talking about consciousness, so I won't.
4451544	4459292	627	A	0.9945	But some of the readings that I mentioned in the lecture might be interesting for you on this topic.
4459356	4486628	628	A	0.9998	So if we're talking about certain structures that seem very pervasive in our phenomenology and how those structures can sometimes kind of dissolve away and how that might be accounted for under an active inference framework, there's some really interesting work on psychedelics by George Dean and some of George Dean's co conspirators.
4486724	4509004	629	A	1	I know Mark and Sam Wilkinson worked on a paper with George so George Dean's done some work on kind of ego dissolution and certain kinds of experiences related to selfhood, kind of and I kind of don't want to overstep the mark, but I think they fall generally under this kind of rebus model of psychedelic efficacy.
4509052	4517200	630	A	0.99621	So I don't know if people are familiar with this, but this kind of finds natural articulation through predictive processing and hierarchical self modeling and that kind of stuff.
4517270	4520124	631	A	1	I also wanted to really quickly flag on this topic.
4520252	4525284	632	A	0.76712	I'll find the paper and I'll put it up on the coder because I don't think I'll be able to find it quickly enough now.
4525322	4535400	633	A	0.99981	But there was a paper that came out very recently that showed the efficacy of internal self talk on sports performance.
4537660	4555984	634	A	0.99998	They did an experiment with cyclists and they found that when cyclists were allowed to engage in kind of constant self talk with them, like an inner monologue in their head, their performance at cycling was measurably boosted, which I thought was really interesting and kind of relevant here.
4556102	4567716	635	A	0.7946	But it's interesting because it sounds like it might prima facia be in tension with what we were saying about flow states as well.
4567738	4567924	636	A	0.99755	Right.
4567962	4582680	637	A	0.99709	So if the real edge of performance is a place where these structures of phenomenology bleed away, it kind of calls into question, like, to what extent are these psychotechnologies effective and in what way are they effective?
4583740	4587690	638	A	0.76688	There's just a whole kind of universe of really interesting questions there.
4588380	4594620	639	H	0.99995	So, if I may, self food, indirectly will be the central topic of the last two sessions.
4595520	4614344	640	H	0.99998	My position about it is that self food, in a sense, we use all of the time, is a quite high level construct that emerges from the ability we have to compare our activity to a socially embedded model of our activity.
4614492	4626352	641	H	0.98069	So that is something that is quite specific to humans because of their linguistic ability and or because of their tendency to what Thomaslo calls shared intentionality.
4626416	4628970	642	H	0.99024	So the ability to collectively define an.
4631180	4641368	643	H	0.83502	So basically, this is something that enables a very deep, very profound and robust transmission of cultural knowledge and transmission of norms.
4641464	4643980	644	H	0.99999	This is what enables the construction of norms.
4645360	4662784	645	H	0.76482	But it's quite heavy cognitively and it is predictable that if you're busy comparing what you do to what an idealized version of yourself is doing, you're going to invest less creative energy in actually doing the thing that you would if you just did a thing.
4662982	4670870	646	H	0.99997	So I'd say you have a pretty direct entailment of this flow thing from this model.
4675720	4676228	647	A	0.99611	Yeah.
4676314	4676708	648	H	0.97	Yes.
4676794	4677744	649	H	0.99989	This is my conclusion.
4677792	4678390	650	A	0.99958	Sorry.
4680120	4688024	651	A	0.83046	So we've run almost 30 minutes over time and I know Mark's had to go and I'm going to have to go very I think I pretty much have to go.
4688062	4695710	652	A	0.99918	So I just wondered if anybody has any final kind of quick questions or comments, maybe we can move towards wrapping it up.
4698560	4706130	653	Daniel	0.99954	I'll make a few comments, but Ben, you're welcome to leave and other people welcome to stay if they would like.
4707700	4708770	654	A	0.99568	Thank you for.
4712180	4717856	655	Daniel	0.93812	Well, first, just on a logistical note, there was a little bit of lag.
4717968	4736724	656	Daniel	0.533	So I'll encourage everyone who's listening, as well as who's participating, that we eventually plan to, as with all of our live streams, develop a transcript which will be curated and published, and eventually not so far away in the future, that'll be enabled with speech modeling to generate podcast quality audio.
4736852	4739560	657	Daniel	0.92761	So the future will be smooth, we promise.
4740380	4748040	658	Daniel	0.99754	But a few really interesting pieces that I picked out while I was embodying and listening.
4749420	4758028	659	Daniel	0.88931	So, Regina, you opened the discussion with surprise and creativity, and indeed, it sounds like it's going to be attention.
4758124	4764220	660	Daniel	1	How can a framework whose imperative is bounded surprise as opposed to, say, maximized reward?
4764380	4770704	661	Daniel	1	How can a framework whose imperative is surprise, minimization and bounding be used to generate novelty?
4770752	4774224	662	Daniel	1	And I felt like people provided a lot of really cool answers.
4774352	4781884	663	Daniel	0.69	And one other thing it reminds me of is Doug Hofstadter's notion of spectishnish.
4781952	4788692	664	Daniel	1	I don't know, how do you pronounce it, but sphexishness, and it's the specs wasp.
4788836	4798392	665	Daniel	0.96	And so he says, well, forget this whole creativity thing, because when we talk about creativity, it's like some sort of pantheon, like divine status.
4798456	4801116	666	Daniel	0.99	The muses have to be called in.
4801218	4804540	667	Daniel	1	And so then, oh, that's not real creativity, and this isn't real creativity.
4804620	4808108	668	Daniel	0.96336	So instead, he says, well, let's just focus on what would be the opposite.
4808284	4815660	669	Daniel	1	And that would be the rote procedural following, even when there's an opportunity for what we would call creativity.
4815820	4817048	670	Daniel	1	And then there's a continuum.
4817084	4819056	671	Daniel	0.99997	So why does somebody paint that painting?
4819168	4821328	672	Daniel	0.39462	Well, why didn't they invent a new genre?
4821424	4823668	673	Daniel	0.9088	Well, why didn't they invent a new media?
4823834	4839204	674	Daniel	1	And so all activity is existing within this continuum of creativeness, which has many features such as generativity and productivity, but also novelty, but abounded novelty.
4839252	4851824	675	Daniel	0.88607	It's not creative to knock the chessboard pieces off in a way that there might be an elegant chess move who only somebody in a certain cognitive setting could detect the aesthetics of.
4851862	4853330	676	Daniel	0.99932	But I think that was awesome.
4854100	4862370	677	Daniel	1	And then the second piece that really was powerful was what mark's train.
4862900	4883000	678	Daniel	1	I guess the trains don't run on time where Mark is, but that's okay, because he was able to, rather than treat that as an undigestible surprise, that was able to be basically cognitively metabolized into an opportunity for friendship through language as a social medium.
4883500	4888340	679	Daniel	0.98	And then he connected that to cognitive flexibility and coaching.
4888500	4894140	680	Daniel	1	And then I thought about self talk and our inner monologue inner voice.
4894800	4913730	681	Daniel	1	And then Darius, that was very provocative, that we aren't having self talk, potentially not even having a self in the flow, manifold experience of the self or the self talk, or again, potentially even the total actual self as a technology.
4914120	4947576	682	Daniel	0.5	And so then healthy self talk would guide us to the flow and be kind of like a self limiting technology because it would be used in order to not be needed to be used, which is kind of how we would hope adaptive technologies would be versus a maladaptive technology would be something that entrenches its own utilization potentially at the expense of the functionality.
4947768	4949992	683	Daniel	0.9999	Kind of like doom scrolling status.
4950136	4951864	684	Daniel	0.99999	But that's internal rumination.
4951912	4955360	685	Daniel	1	And those are the kinds of things that people have simulated in active inference.
4955700	4958412	686	Daniel	0.99291	So those were some really cool pieces.
4958476	4960000	687	Daniel	0.99964	That was a great discussion.
4961060	4967284	688	A	0.94603	Could I just add something on the topic of creativity that I should have said earlier as well?
4967322	4975024	689	A	0.9946	Because I think it's really relevant to Regina's question and just the topic of creative and novel behaviors in general under active inference.
4975072	5000876	690	A	0.99	I think that whenever we talk about especially artistic creativity, there's a tendency, even for people who are kind of very well burrowed into active inference and activism and these kinds of frameworks from cognitive science, I think there's a tendency to think of creativity as still like it's almost like the last bastion of internal cognitiveist thinking.
5001058	5004780	691	A	0.92179	We think creativity is something that happens in here and bursts outwards.
5004860	5010300	692	A	0.97	And so how does that happen with this kind of whatever cognitive architecture we're positing?
5010460	5020064	693	A	0.99709	But there's really very cool work by I have to give a shout out to Mike Wheeler, who has written some papers on the extended mind and creativity.
5020192	5031896	694	A	0.87	And one thing that's not really come up very much that I didn't get time to talk about in the lecture is this really nice natural marriage between the extended mind and active inference, something that Andy Clark has been working on.
5031918	5035016	695	A	1	And I know he's going to be doing a lot more work on it.
5035038	5055680	696	A	0.87266	But the claim Wheeler makes and some others I think Joanna Zelenska has written a little bit about this as well, is the fact that creativity itself is just as subject to kind of material, the sculpting effects of material environments and sociocultural environments as everything else is.
5055830	5069204	697	A	0.97109	So creativity is not this kind of romantic with a capital R kind of internal process that kind of bursts forth, but creative thinking is just as much extended and embedded as everything else.
5069242	5073940	698	A	0.99	And there's some really great examples in Mike Wheeler's essay.
5074280	5077190	699	A	1	I don't know, is anybody familiar with the band Alt J?
5077640	5079116	700	A	0.89868	They're a British band.
5079168	5081080	701	A	0.99723	They were kind of really big a few years ago.
5081150	5085130	702	A	0.99964	They won the Mercury Music Award because they have a super original sound.
5085900	5089320	703	A	0.99701	So AltJ have this really quiet tinkling.
5089740	5090868	704	A	0.99868	Yeah, they are a great band.
5090884	5091876	705	A	0.79043	They're one of my favorites.
5091908	5101340	706	A	0.98	And they have this really quiet tinky sound that everybody kind of assumed was just the result of some kind of internal genius on the part of the band.
5101840	5114460	707	A	0.99	And as it turns out, AltJ, originally they tried to rehearse as an indie rock band, but they were confined to rehearsing in an apartment block, and they kept getting noise complaints.
5114620	5123200	708	A	1	And so they ended up developing this quiet tinkly sound because it was the only sound they could rehearse that wouldn't get them kicked out of their apartment.
5123360	5139024	709	A	1	And I think this is a really beautiful example of how even the most creative processes that seem, on the face of it, really creative, are in fact just a subject to these external kind of this kind of agent environment system that underpins the whole framework.
5139092	5142750	710	A	0.99757	So that's something that's going to apply to absolutely everything.
5144000	5144748	711	Daniel	0.99998	Awesome.
5144914	5152896	712	Daniel	1	And just the last question, people are welcome to drop off the next section that we're heading into.
5152998	5158988	713	Daniel	0.99826	I'll be doing the lecture that's going to be in August, and it's going to be on collective behavior.
5159084	5167220	714	Daniel	0.99969	So what would people like to learn or focus on about collective behavior?
5177640	5189320	715	Daniel	0.63797	Anyone who hasn't spoken or it can just be a thought question, but I haven't prepared the slides at all, so I'm happy to take suggestions.
5192620	5194590	716	Daniel	0.99427	Yeah, Darius and then anyone else?
5194960	5203260	717	Darius	1	I think what might be interesting is if we're saying that these systems are all in the business of reducing prediction error, of self evidencing.
5203760	5217080	718	Darius	0.85012	Why do we see a diversity why do we see a diversity of social cultures, of norms, of standards at a global scale?
5217260	5232372	719	Darius	0.9905	Why do we not just see some homogeneous way to reduce picture there, which would manifest as the kind of singular culture which is in the kind of business of self evidencing?
5232516	5234250	720	Darius	0.9999	That just kind of popped in my mind.
5236060	5236810	721	A	0.99999	Cool.
5241920	5246024	722	Daniel	0.99855	Anyone else want to give a thought on collective behavior or on any other aspect?
5246152	5247710	723	Daniel	0.99997	Otherwise it's been great.
5248320	5261330	724	H	0.91525	I'd like to make a comment of creativity, but does anyone like at the moment, if you want to make a comment on the next session, I want to put that.
5262900	5264290	725	I	0.57056	Okay, go for it.
5265460	5280890	726	H	0.73298	I'd say that to complement what Ben said, that creativity is intrinsically very hard to model because by definition, creativity is something that brings about something new, let us say.
5281340	5288410	727	H	0.59	And the mathematics we have to describe physics and life, they are not very good at new things.
5289340	5305070	728	H	0.99999	Because the most basic tool you have, the basic way to represent a system that literally everyone uses, is a stead space, which is the least of all possibilities of a system.
5305440	5311404	729	H	0.99998	If you say something is creative, you're likely to think that it means it can bring about new possibilities.
5311532	5316824	730	H	0.74	And this intuition, it conflicts directly with the very basic use of math.
5316972	5317924	731	H	0.99825	Describe it.
5318042	5326960	732	H	0.99982	So it is basically the same issues I was referring to earlier when I talked about the comparison between active inference and an activist.
5327120	5337364	733	H	0.63437	So let's say activity biology inspired model of cognition, and a core concept historically in those circles is autopoiesis.
5337412	5342940	734	H	0.99977	So the ability of the living to self create, literally, this is Greek for self creation.
5343360	5353096	735	H	0.55	And you had a lot of drift and conceptualization and ambiguities that were resolved or not resolved and led to the crisis of framework, blah, blah, blah.
5353208	5357476	736	H	0.99991	But today we talk of autonomy rather than autopoiesis.
5357608	5367090	737	H	1	And we define autonomy as the property for a system of constraints over the activity of a system to reproduce themselves.
5367480	5379712	738	H	0.99	And because we're talking constraints, just the ability to influence causality outcomes, there is no really a prior that dynamics in this space would be conservative.
5379776	5385144	739	H	0.9657	So we have a possibility for constraints to bring about new things and reconfigure themselves.
5385342	5389050	740	H	1	And the notion of Hydrancy ADUs is based on that.
5389500	5400028	741	H	0.58403	It's the ability to, let's say, reconfigure constraints in your environment, and so is the notion of creativity, which would be likely a very close proxy to that.
5400114	5404110	742	H	0.92765	But it's something that we do not know how to present.
5405220	5410316	743	H	0.97	And most of the mathematics that exist are structurally enabled, represent.
5410508	5413330	744	H	0.57	And so, yeah, that's a big one.
5417400	5418390	745	Daniel	0.91263	So true.
5421000	5421860	746	A	0.99515	Michael.
5426600	5427396	747	I	0.99809	Good to be here.
5427418	5428580	748	I	0.99955	Sorry I was late.
5429800	5435320	749	I	0.99963	What comes to mind for me at the know, I mentioned units of collective, like, what is it, a we?
5435390	5436840	750	I	0.69557	Is it a we a pair?
5439420	5440584	751	I	0.99993	What are the units of we.
5440622	5442910	752	I	1	And any thoughts or insights about that?
5444000	5458944	753	I	0.81	The stages of the emergence of formation into a collective from a me to a we, for example, or god, I had one was on the tip of my tongue, and it just escaped me.
5459062	5459730	754	I	0.97	Oh.
5460740	5495740	755	I	0.99985	This idea of precision that I think it was Mark Miller was talking about, or Matt saying at the if there's options in the looking at collective what might be some of the most well understood limiting beliefs about when we use language of collective that keeps us repeating the same blind spots.
5497520	5505310	756	I	1	And how might we think differently about collective so that we escape those predispositions, if you will?
5505760	5506770	757	I	0.83133	Makes sense.
5509700	5511824	758	Daniel	0.64828	They'll do what I can do in.
5511862	5515392	759	I	1	The solo lecture, and I'll look forward.
5515526	5517884	760	Daniel	1	To the conversation where we can unpack.
5517932	5518530	761	Darius	0.51559	It.
5520260	5520812	762	I	0.95476	Exciting.
5520876	5521664	763	I	0.99974	Thank you for doing it.
5521702	5523376	764	I	0.63004	I'm looking forward to it.
5523478	5524336	765	Daniel	0.98618	Yeah, it's awesome.
5524438	5526690	766	Daniel	0.99828	Nathan or David, you want to add anything?
5532170	5533414	767	Daniel	0.86	All right, then.
5533452	5534150	768	Daniel	0.99976	Thank you all.
5534220	5536902	769	Daniel	0.99978	Hope everyone is enjoying the course so far.
5536956	5539414	770	Daniel	0.99945	Thanks, Avel, again for coordinating it.
5539452	5542482	771	Daniel	1	And to Ben for this great section.
5542626	5545320	772	Daniel	1	Now you can put on your student hat again.
5546010	5547750	773	H	0.93	And to you for organizing.
5548650	5549318	774	Daniel	0.99953	Thank you.
5549404	5550214	775	Daniel	0.99987	See you all next time.
5550252	5550840	776	Francisco	0.96196	Thanks.
5551610	5552210	777	B	0.89185	Bye.
5552290	5553080	778	I	0.86621	Thank you.
5554010	5554660	779	Darius	0.96795	Thanks, everyone.
