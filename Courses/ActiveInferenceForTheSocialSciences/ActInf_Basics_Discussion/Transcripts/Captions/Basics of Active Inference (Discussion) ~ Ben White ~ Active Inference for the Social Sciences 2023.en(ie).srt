1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,420
all right July 25th 2023

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,300
and we are in the discussion section

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,639
basics of active inference this is the

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,440
first discussion section that we've had

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,260
for this course so thank you all for

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,320
joining and it's going to be regarding

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,800
the topics that Ben White introduced in

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,640
his recent lecture so everyone will be

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,239
welcome to pop in and introduce

10
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,719
themselves and then I know that Ben has

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,620
some ideas to discuss and many other

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,559
spontaneous and written questions will

13
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,079
come into play so

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,340
I will uh with that exit for now and

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,340
pass to perhaps some of our first time

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,960
live stream guests

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,040
I guess I've already spoken so uh I may

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,560
as well continue so I'm Darius

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,720
um I am Master student I'm just about to

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,119
finish at UCL

21
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,920
and sort of social distributed cognition

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,840
I work in the social cognition lab

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,900
looking at salience regulation and

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,939
attentional mechanisms within social

25
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,540
contexts and but all within an active

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,040
inference framework

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,600
um within the Bayesian brain hypothesis

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,020
framework and yeah it's a sort of recent

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,600
Discovery and Obsession and so I'm sort

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,100
of going to grips with the both the high

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,560
road and the low road

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,880
um and so I've had the opportunity to

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,380
chat to Mark and some other researchers

34
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,700
who have been super informative but

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,680
always looking to learn more and get my

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,880
head around even more of the sort of

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,158
philosophical and mathematical Theory

38
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,079
oh

39
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,320
sounds good

40
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,000
so hey everyone can you hear me

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,560
yep

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,199
I'm Francisco balzan I'm a PhD student

43
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,480
at the University of Bologna Italy

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,800
actually really working on the

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,540
intersection between artificial

46
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,599
intelligence and education and I have a

47
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,040
background in cognitive anthropology and

48
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,959
philosophy of science and

49
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,140
I'm at excellent I'm actually in a

50
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,760
a few years ago

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,220
so I stepped out into the rabbit program

52
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,440
active inference and currently pretty

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,720
much interested in uh

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,819
um multi-scale active inference models

55
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,220
are the scientific technicians so

56
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,200
pretty interested about the agent level

57
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,780
modeling of scientific reasoning the

58
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,340
assumption that might emerge from the

59
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,319
interaction with the scientific

60
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,480
environment so we're referring to

61
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,160
Scientific music construction and all

62
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,379
this type of

63
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,760
top-down environment interactions so

64
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,800
super interested to

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,900
do something from you thank you

66
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,680
thank you very much

67
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,620
would anybody else like to introduce

68
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,159
themselves before we start

69
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,940
thank you

70
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,959
so you can first okay hi hi I'm Regina

71
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,819
Sagi umina I'm from Guatemala and well

72
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,980
I'm not from the social sciences I come

73
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,159
from biology and Neuroscience and um I'm

74
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,900
here because

75
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,519
um I'm working on a project as a

76
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,400
technical operator in this big project

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,900
in DX Escape material mines and I do the

78
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,940
technical part and experiments but I

79
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,580
want to learn the philosophical part

80
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,920
that's the background that you know

81
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,200
makes The Theory of Everything we're

82
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,620
going to you know experiment so I'm here

83
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,060
to learn

84
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,700
um and also I am like you know when you

85
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,299
see the Olympics that you you see all

86
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,340
the swimmers and you always say I wish

87
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,680
there was a normal guy to see how good

88
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,720
these people are so you could compare so

89
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,000
that's me today right I I understand

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,459
half of what's going on but I'm happy to

91
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,299
be here

92
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,220
so yeah hi

93
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,460
oh yeah sorry I'm late um sorry my

94
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,979
name's Lee um I'm a PhD student at the

95
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,500
uh University of New York

96
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,080
um studying systems transformation

97
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,040
um and I'm I'm joining because I'm using

98
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,220
uh perceptual control theory at the

99
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,800
minute to uh to model examples of

100
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,660
effective practice

101
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,240
um in organizations and and I've read

102
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,280
quite a lot of um

103
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,620
active inference papers and I understand

104
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,960
that there's a lot of resonance uh and

105
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,340
overlap between perceptual control

106
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,259
theory and

107
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,540
um active influence although I

108
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,860
understand it's within a predicted

109
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,800
framework and also it's uh it's a kind

110
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,900
of a level of abstraction higher so

111
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,759
you're able to kind of quantify the

112
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,500
difference between

113
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,180
um sort of the the predictive State or

114
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,860
the outcome State and you know in the

115
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,840
current state so what I'm really trying

116
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,139
to understand is how might that level of

117
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,540
abstraction be useful

118
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,460
um in what I'm doing actually because I

119
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,900
understand it's a you know a much more

120
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,600
kind of concurrent Theory and framework

121
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,759
than um then perceptual control theory

122
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,479
yeah very cool

123
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,199
um anybody else

124
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,638
I think there's was that everybody

125
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,220
okay well um was everybody

126
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,139
um present at the has everybody seen the

127
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,780
lecture that I gave a couple of weeks

128
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,100
ago

129
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,800
okay so what I think it might be helpful

130
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,259
then if I kind of very very briefly go

131
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,300
over what what we covered in that

132
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,460
lecture just to kind of jog people's

133
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,080
memories and then we can maybe pick up

134
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,240
some questions from there

135
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,039
um so the lecture last week was on the

136
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,800
basics of active inference and it was

137
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,759
um

138
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,979
intended to be an introduction to the

139
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,539
framework on a very abstract

140
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,759
philosophical level so it left out all

141
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,500
of the kind of mathematics and Technical

142
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,840
aspects of the framework and the

143
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,520
objective really was to lay the

144
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,560
groundwork for future weeks in this

145
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,960
course because

146
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,419
um this is obviously a course on active

147
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,120
inference in the social sciences and so

148
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,680
in the subsequent weeks we're going to

149
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,240
be looking at topics like Collective

150
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,840
Behavior social cognition uh shared

151
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,720
norms and Niche construction and so what

152
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,060
I wanted to do was to put on the table

153
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,840
um

154
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,060
a kind of

155
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,160
fully fleshed out picture of what the

156
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,919
individual agent looks like in active

157
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,440
inference and so to do this

158
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,720
um we looked at uh emotion agency uh

159
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,940
mind so we looked at kind of the role of

160
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,139
action

161
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:02,759
um and perception

162
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,940
um the role of internal representations

163
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,160
um inactive imprints and then as a case

164
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,280
study we kind of we looked at a active

165
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,100
inference based account of addiction to

166
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,360
kind of bring all of these threads

167
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,500
together

168
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,259
um to kind of articulate a lot of the

169
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,520
things that that I'd said in the

170
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,199
previous sections

171
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,639
um

172
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,259
so

173
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,599
I'm I mean the questions here don't have

174
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,340
to be specifically

175
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,560
um Tethered to that lecture I suppose we

176
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,460
can just start with any general

177
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,259
questions about active inference and

178
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,539
philosophy and how active inference

179
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,039
applies to individual agents or if

180
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,300
anybody did want to pick up on any

181
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,220
threads from the lecture then we can go

182
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,580
from there

183
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,319
can I ask something just for the basic

184
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,900
questions yeah of course

185
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,639
um I don't understand because I think

186
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,560
you explain it later but how

187
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,220
how does creativity and

188
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,919
science in general enters active

189
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,180
imprints

190
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,880
how does trying to be creative and not

191
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,060
put doing what you predict enters this

192
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,900
like role yeah yeah this is a really

193
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,060
good question and I think um so were you

194
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,599
there have you did you see the lecture

195
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,120
yeah but I remember half of it yeah

196
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,879
that's that's fine but I think uh I

197
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,860
think do you remember the dark room

198
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,740
problem yeah yeah I know that's that's

199
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,740
where the answer is but yeah well that's

200
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,260
it's it's it's it's I think there are

201
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,500
several

202
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,820
interested in that dark room problem

203
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,559
some of them are some of them more

204
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,539
interesting than others and I I tried to

205
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,799
cover I did obviously didn't have time

206
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,740
to cover all of those in the lecture

207
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,440
um but the kind of for those that

208
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,940
perhaps aren't familiar the dark room

209
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,100
problem is um this kind of canonical

210
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,200
philosophical worry

211
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,060
um about predictive processing and

212
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,580
active inference that says essentially

213
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,100
if it's if all we're trying to do is

214
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,399
minimize prediction errors why don't we

215
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,920
um just find maximally predictable

216
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,620
environments and you know why do we not

217
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,420
just lay in a dark room hooked up to an

218
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,820
intravenous trip and enjoy a kind of

219
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,100
error-free Lifestyle

220
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,720
um so I think that's the kind of that's

221
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,100
the question that you're articulating

222
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,240
there

223
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,339
um I just quickly see a hand from Darius

224
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,899
Darius did you want to jump in or is it

225
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,440
a separate question

226
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,120
it's a separate question so I would just

227
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,920
do it in advance but yeah no ignore me

228
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,500
I'll Circle back around in a second then

229
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,660
you're free um I should say actually

230
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,100
um this is the first time I've kind of

231
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,500
shared a discussion like this so I'll be

232
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,180
explicit and say um people should just

233
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,459
feel free to jump in whenever they want

234
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,779
if you want to take the Disco If you

235
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,660
want to kind of um add something or or

236
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,100
kind of build on a question that we're

237
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,920
answering feel free to jump in

238
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,540
um but yeah with it with a dark room

239
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,540
problem the as I as I'm aware the first

240
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,980
answer to that question and this is

241
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,480
something that I did Cover in the

242
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,399
lecture is

243
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,440
essentially a big part of active

244
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,240
inference is to recognize that the

245
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,000
agents are it's a kind of fundamentally

246
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,820
embodied framework okay so what that

247
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,980
that can be kind of cashed out in

248
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,320
various ways but one of the one of the

249
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,120
most important ways is that the the

250
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,580
expected states of the organism or that

251
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,940
the agent are necessarily rooted in the

252
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,160
phenotype of the organism and the the

253
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,440
kind of evolutionary biological needs

254
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,940
that come with having a particular body

255
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,339
so there was a paper that I referenced

256
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,040
in a lecture by

257
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,380
that's three authors on this paper it's

258
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,600
Andy Clark call for assistant and then

259
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,459
I'm forgetting the name of the third

260
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,800
author if anybody can recall

261
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,019
um feel free to drop it in the chat but

262
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,579
this is this is an answer to the dark

263
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,459
room where it builds on that notion of

264
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,680
embodiment and says look

265
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,640
um creatures like us humanism

266
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,220
in the dark room and do nothing and just

267
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,820
uh kind of enjoy the very predictable

268
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,519
March of hunger Thursday Etc but

269
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,620
obviously those particular biology of

270
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,720
the room and so you have this very

271
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,579
fundamental level

272
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,399
um

273
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,579
we have this very fundamental um kind of

274
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,839
basis upon which we have these needs

275
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,040
that need to be met and so we need to

276
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,500
engage in exploratory behaviors

277
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,839
um on the topic of novelty

278
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,220
um because that's because that's the

279
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,079
kind of Base I take that to be a kind of

280
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,820
Baseline answer

281
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,160
um but there are clearly

282
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,899
um kinds of activities and behaviors

283
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,360
that we do engage in

284
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,760
um going beyond the dark room kind of

285
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,760
curiosity play

286
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,880
um creativity engaging in kind of why do

287
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,160
we create works of art and it there's

288
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,680
not an obvious link between those kinds

289
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,660
of behaviors and the kinds of biological

290
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,399
needs

291
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,720
um that are emphasized in the original

292
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,839
answer to the dark room worry

293
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,600
um so in answer to Regina's question

294
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,079
about creativity I think that a good

295
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,720
starting point for this is the section

296
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,959
on aerodynamics that I introduced in the

297
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:13,440
lecture so this was the idea that it

298
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,740
there's this strong connection between

299
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,779
affectivity as a kind of emotional

300
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,560
embodied feeling State and the changes

301
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,940
to the rate in prediction error

302
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,279
minimization so I don't know

303
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,920
um I am now very much uh articulating

304
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,899
Mark's Work here so I don't know if Mark

305
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,540
wants to jump in at any point and do a

306
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,279
much better job than I can

307
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,260
um

308
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,260
yeah I think there's there's certainly

309
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,880
there's certainly work on the horizon

310
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,740
well I know that there are people who

311
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,200
are currently building a series of

312
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,480
artistic pretty that are

313
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,600
that are based on this this idea of

314
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,260
aerodynamics so Mark's paper on play

315
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,899
with Mark andon that I mentioned has

316
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,240
really interesting idea where if you

317
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,639
explain

318
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,740
playful behaviors which are kind of

319
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,540
fundamentally created and very we are

320
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,820
you know it's inherently creative

321
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,160
exercise I think the really interesting

322
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,160
idea that comes out of that is one thing

323
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,200
that we engage in because it feels good

324
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,839
is we we create niches of very

325
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,240
manageable prediction error that we can

326
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,959
then minimize

327
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,060
um so yeah that's playful behavior on is

328
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,160
the kind of the answer to the puzzle of

329
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,959
play so why do we in the puzzle of the

330
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,920
players why do we engage in previous uh

331
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,839
metabolically quite costly

332
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:40,380
um

333
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,920
and they don't have any obvious benefit

334
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,300
and the idea there's that well there's

335
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,420
there's kind of several ideas in there

336
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,800
um but one of them is that it just

337
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,480
literally feels good because minimizing

338
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,880
prediction error feels good to us so

339
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,440
whenever we do better than expect at

340
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,880
minimizing prediction error it feels

341
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,779
good and so I think so obviously I don't

342
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,220
know for sure but I think that any

343
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,560
answer that we give regarding artistic

344
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,019
creativity is going to fall within that

345
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,279
kind of bulk that essentially we engage

346
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,220
um in the part of the creative process

347
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,459
is just constructing those that give us

348
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,359
tasks

349
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,139
games of manageable prediction error

350
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,440
that ideally sit at the boundaries of

351
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,120
our skill capability can I add two quick

352
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,399
things there Ben so just so that was a

353
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,959
great explanation but just to hit two

354
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,600
points a little bit harder one

355
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,639
you might think

356
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,300
um all that matters existing error

357
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,680
that's why it looked a little bit

358
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,480
paradoxical that we also pre

359
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,639
antithetical to our modus operandi which

360
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,680
is to reduce error but when you remember

361
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,139
that for our contradiction error

362
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,180
minimizing system we have a really deep

363
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,339
temporal model we're managing

364
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,519
uncertainty at a big Horizon uh maybe

365
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,620
even multi-generational you know where

366
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,060
we're thinking about our kids or our

367
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,980
kids I mean who knows how deep the

368
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,139
generative model actually runs it turns

369
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,500
out that

370
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,040
that stops developing error minimizing

371
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,600
skills and abilities and just hangs out

372
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,639
in one Micro Niche because that Micro

373
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,740
Niche is going to be upset sooner or a

374
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,480
little bit right I mean it's such a

375
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,459
great example of where we thought we

376
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,040
were in a really set Vector State and

377
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,779
then suddenly it gets jostle then all of

378
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,000
us go oh my goodness like what do we do

379
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,860
we've been bumped

380
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,540
um and uh it turns out that the best air

381
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,959
minimize will be the

382
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,860
responsive to kinds of errors that are

383
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Advanced and it hates those errors are

384
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,560
digestible so that means not too complex

385
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,639
that you can't do anything with it you

386
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,959
can't learn anything from it but also

387
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,279
not so boring that there's nothing to

388
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,380
learn if we hang out if we're sensitive

389
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,240
to and we hang out at the edge of our

390
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,880
capability then we keep developing new

391
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,399
error minimizing abilities which

392
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,199
actually sets us up to be good error

393
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,880
minimizing systems over the long run so

394
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,199
even though we're investing metabolism

395
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,600
now we're getting we're setting

396
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,519
ourselves up to be able to manage you

397
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,899
know especially in the deep end of the

398
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,420
pool Black Swan funds manage uncertainty

399
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,620
that we're not going to be able to

400
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,300
predict the really unpredictable

401
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,040
unpredictable

402
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,720
um that comes from hanging out at this

403
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,240
Edge so part of our curiosity and

404
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,820
playfulness and creativity are going to

405
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,000
be about us making and digesting novel

406
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,820
slopes of volatility I think that's one

407
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,399
that's one really great answer for why

408
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,259
you get playfulness and curiosity out of

409
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,060
this and creativity I'll just drop one

410
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,320
more and we don't have to get into it

411
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,480
too deeply here but here's one other one

412
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,040
that we're thinking of

413
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,019
there's something really special in the

414
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,000
creation of art especially in a public

415
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,980
sphere that I think is so interesting

416
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,600
and that somebody needs to be sort of

417
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,980
looking at this

418
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,959
um we there's actually a new collection

419
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,140
coming out in philosophical Trends B

420
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,199
um on Art and predictive processing

421
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,400
which I think you should check out if

422
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,319
you're interested in these topics

423
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,760
um but the idea that we've been thinking

424
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,260
about is there are ways that we can

425
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,199
bring our generative model out and put

426
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,660
it into a public sphere you can take

427
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,980
something which is typically on the

428
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,020
inside and you can put it outside

429
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,640
and then you can have other error

430
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,640
minimizing systems look at it and Fiddle

431
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,040
around with it and then we can re-imbibe

432
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,059
it

433
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,440
um I mean we're doing this all the time

434
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,120
I mean that's what language allows us to

435
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,559
do and what writing allows us to do

436
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,539
think about maths you're bringing a part

437
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,600
of your predictive understanding you're

438
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,679
laying it out and other predictive

439
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,059
agents can fiddle around with it and

440
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,740
then you can take it back in as part of

441
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,200
your updating your own model and I don't

442
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,539
know how much more I can say here I just

443
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,160
think this is a kind of horizon but I

444
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,360
think there's a really juicy thing to

445
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,660
say here about where real art is like

446
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,700
Tolstoy maybe Leo tostai was already on

447
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,980
this where you put something of the

448
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,100
Creator in the creation and then other

449
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,039
people receive that and then they can

450
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,320
they can um they can do something else

451
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,179
with it and then you're able to sort of

452
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,520
take it back in all under the guise of

453
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,380
sort of minimizing volatility or

454
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,179
understanding volatility

455
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,820
maybe that was a bit deep but uh no that

456
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,080
was really that was pretty good yeah

457
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,400
yeah

458
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,740
um I just didn't so in the chat I just

459
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,320
dropped a link to um

460
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,059
um yeah so somebody just asked about

461
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,400
papers related to hanging out at the

462
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,320
edge of our capabilities I'll do that

463
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,080
right now uh yeah sure awesome papers on

464
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,120
that uh Mark's got a few I already

465
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,220
dropped a link in there to an aeon

466
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,980
article by um some of the old expect

467
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,980
project crew including Mark Kate Nave

468
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,020
George Dean and Andy Clark on the value

469
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,000
of uncertainty which is

470
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,039
I think it's a really good start point

471
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,200
for some of these questions

472
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,380
um just because it's aeon is a kind of

473
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,000
non-academic

474
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,220
um place where you can you know it's a

475
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,020
it's a non-technical introduction and

476
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,700
there's a wonderful example in that

477
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,039
paper of a guy named I think it's Max

478
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,460
Hawkins is that right Mark Max who um

479
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,340
he's a kind of tech guy and he realized

480
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,840
he was getting kind of bored with his

481
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,840
life he inadvertently trapped himself in

482
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,880
a dark room because his life had become

483
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,860
so

484
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,140
wrote and scheduled and systematic he

485
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,580
realized that he would be kind of

486
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,740
incredibly easy to kidnap because he was

487
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,660
in the same place at the same time every

488
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,900
single day and to get he took drastic

489
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,059
action to break out of that dark room so

490
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,080
he he kind of introduced a

491
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,000
randomization algorithm that would it

492
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,220
would kind of choose for him where he

493
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,600
was going to eat where he was going to

494
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,299
go which shows he was going to attend

495
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,740
and this example is a really nice

496
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,080
centerpiece in this article so and I

497
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,700
think yeah I think this is a nice place

498
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,500
to start because it's also grounded in

499
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,720
discussions about epistemic actions as

500
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,760
well because there's also you know as

501
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,640
cool as play and art and creativity are

502
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,980
there's also really really good reasons

503
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,080
that uncertainty is valuable as well

504
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,419
right because

505
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,760
while we might want to exploit all of

506
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,559
the opportunities for kind of

507
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,140
nourishment and valuable predictionary

508
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,539
minimization in our environment there

509
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,179
are of course going to be times where

510
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,919
um those those opportunities are

511
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,500
exhausted and we need to go and explore

512
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,600
different ones and I think there's some

513
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,940
there's there's some stuff in there as

514
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,919
well on epistemic actions within the

515
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,900
context of navigation as well so

516
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,600
sometimes we're going to have to we're

517
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,799
going to have to temporarily move

518
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,840
further away from our Target in order to

519
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,520
minimize our uncertainty about where

520
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,679
we're going so there's lots and lots of

521
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,320
of stuff on the value of uncertainty

522
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,440
um and it kind of it's very much at the

523
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,460
Forefront of some of the really

524
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,440
interesting philosophical applications

525
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,900
of the framework for sure

526
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,140
okay yeah by all means yeah we've got

527
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,059
time you just said something I know you

528
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,740
have a question that is but

529
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,020
with the value of uncertainty it's just

530
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,940
that I'm thinking because I've been

531
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,820
working a lot with The Magicians and

532
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,880
there's a way of using uncertainty as

533
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,240
entertainment and it's very difficult to

534
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,280
understand it's like you know as a

535
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,020
concept for entertainment why would you

536
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,700
like to be in a place where you cannot

537
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,400
you want to predict but you cannot and

538
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,980
you still want to participate in this

539
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,740
activity so for me magic shows it's

540
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,380
gonna break in a little bit

541
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,280
um

542
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,059
yeah I think my I spoke to um

543
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,280
I forget the person's name but there was

544
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,919
a Escape meeting here at Sussex and I

545
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,539
spoke to one of the guys on Xscape who

546
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,340
had been working on Magic

547
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,780
um I don't know if you know who I'm

548
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,860
talking about but I think they have a

549
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,360
book on on Magic

550
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,220
um and I think that's really cool to

551
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,900
think about from a predictive process in

552
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,640
perspective the idea that magic is just

553
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,460
these wonderful kind of violations of

554
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,919
expectations in a certain sense I think

555
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,840
predictive processing provides a nice

556
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,059
really intuitive framework for thinking

557
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,039
about those kinds of things one one

558
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,960
little point there uh Regina just about

559
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,500
again if it feels paradoxical just to

560
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,679
sort of um complexify your view remember

561
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,780
that the this is always happening in a

562
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,159
hierarchical system

563
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,559
so just because you have errors at one

564
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,120
level of the system doesn't mean you're

565
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,340
going to have sort of critical cascading

566
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,340
unbearable errors at higher levels so

567
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,380
that's why it's fun to go to horror

568
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,659
movies so I dropped the paper here also

569
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:28,860
we have a new paper coming out on on

570
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,360
horror movies I'm pretty interested in

571
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,380
this

572
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,880
um but it's the same as the it's the

573
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,260
same as going to the magic show in some

574
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,140
way now the reason why those errors are

575
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,559
are fun is because we're safe in a

576
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,760
theater

577
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,100
um we're with our friends we have lots

578
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,480
of sugar in our system from eating

579
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,520
popcorn and Candy

580
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,400
um we can control the amount of scary by

581
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,419
by you know covering our eyes or like

582
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,480
there's lots of control here and yet

583
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,059
we're getting media that is that's

584
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,919
pinging all of our evolutionarily

585
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,500
ancient error tracking systems so that

586
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,780
we're getting jumps in the physiology as

587
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,460
if there's a bunch of volatility that we

588
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,260
need to manage and yet we're in a

589
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,880
completely safe space which is really

590
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,620
fun for our kind of system because we're

591
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,900
hierarchy LED predictive systems the

592
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,299
high level here isn't jeopardized it

593
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,460
knows I'm in a theater but the low level

594
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,039
stuff is still registering all sorts of

595
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,659
little volatilities but of course they

596
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,000
get squashed they don't Cascade all the

597
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,260
way up

598
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,360
um or or if you're the kind of person

599
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,940
where they do tend to cast all the way

600
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,080
up then you're also the kind of person

601
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,280
who doesn't like going to horror movies

602
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,760
because it kind of scared like you go

603
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,159
home and think oh goodness maybe ghosts

604
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,780
are real and maybe I live with them you

605
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,580
wouldn't be going there then so with

606
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,440
magic it's the same sort of thing

607
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,000
um we know to a certain against so

608
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,220
with errors

609
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,480
I don't know if you've ever seen um

610
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
who does the really extreme magic David

611
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,559
where he like was in a block yeah David

612
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,820
Blaine have you ever seen him he goes to

613
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,020
Haiti where you have a community that

614
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,100
really believes in Magic and he does

615
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,720
some magic and he gets into trouble like

616
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,820
suddenly all the young men are like oh

617
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,880
no no no no that's that's no bueno that

618
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,500
that you're doing this and then he had

619
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,120
to the camera pans back and he goes no

620
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,799
no hold on I'll show you here I'll show

621
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,299
you how it's done it was just a trick

622
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:22,980
I'll just show you outside it's not real

623
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,380
magic because there they're not having

624
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,299
fun with it anymore they're like no

625
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,659
that's like not a good thing to do you

626
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,000
know so it just goes to show that like

627
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,620
um

628
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,600
our our engagement with magic is mostly

629
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,240
a sort of scary play yeah

630
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,820
I think one thing I just kind of sorry

631
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,200
about the seagulls I don't know if you

632
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,059
can hear those there are seagulls going

633
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,159
crazy just outside my window

634
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,220
um one thing I would add is I think um

635
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,159
another aspect to this this part of the

636
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,280
framework wherein you have this value of

637
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,520
prediction error kind of epistemic and

638
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,260
affective emotional value of prediction

639
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,360
error it's one of the kind of key

640
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,320
elements in this notion of uh agency get

641
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,940
in active inference that I think is

642
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,400
really it's gonna be really important in

643
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,380
mind as you go through the further weeks

644
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,159
of this course as well so what

645
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,360
you know like I said in the lecture it's

646
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,980
not necessarily speaking to a quite the

647
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,600
metaphysical question of free will but

648
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,159
it's certainly moving us away from this

649
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,380
picture of of the agent as a kind of

650
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,779
automaton that's just following rules

651
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,760
There's real space here for kind of

652
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,980
individuality and creativity as well

653
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,320
okay Darius has been waiting a little

654
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,760
while so

655
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,460
um let's go over to him happily patience

656
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,900
happily

657
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,360
um yeah I mean this is this question I

658
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,500
guess is deriving from my thoughts about

659
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,059
the meeting of the the high road and the

660
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,799
low road

661
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,480
some of the recent work that's been

662
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,159
coming out on Maxwell ramseed an actual

663
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,600
conversation I had with him which is

664
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,178
that the generative model of the states

665
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,059
so my question given that

666
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:09,740
give it an tall

667
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,320
is regarding the notion of affordances I

668
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,700
think it's natural that as cognitive

669
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,320
scientists and philosophers we take the

670
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,900
perspective intuitively of the agent in

671
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,640
the agent to reading a relationship and

672
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,500
how the agent is in the business of

673
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,840
reducing prediction error I was just

674
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,039
wondering whether

675
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,260
as philosophers

676
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,720
um you and Mark have thought about what

677
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,460
it would what is it like

678
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,380
out for the whole system to be in the

679
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,059
business of producing its uh prediction

680
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,940
error so I'm interested in flow States

681
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,320
um and so for example my thinking is is

682
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,520
that in the canonical example of

683
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,919
Thursday let's say a rock climber the

684
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,419
the climbing ball is also in the

685
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,880
business of losing its prediction error

686
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,700
as to afford the opportunity for it to

687
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,919
be

688
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,260
exploited stealth or themselves are in

689
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,240
the business of reducing uh prediction

690
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,679
now so I'm wondering whether this

691
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,100
expansion of affordances is

692
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,179
bi-directional traditional infinitely

693
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,260
directions better

694
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:15,860
that's an amazing request so um you

695
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,240
uh the Revenge the Axel constant that

696
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,340
somebody uh someone else but I spoke to

697
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,679
Maxwell ramstead last week

698
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,659
um yeah yeah

699
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,360
there's a there's a paper on uh I'll

700
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,580
find it in a second on uh Nishka

701
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,260
instruction

702
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,059
um and

703
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:40,220
um affordances I think it's

704
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,179
the Symmetry between uh a niche and an

705
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:49,440
agent

706
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,000
um very much in like the same vein as

707
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,200
you were just talking about there this

708
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,860
idea that it's not just uh there's not

709
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,020
just this unidirectional kind of fit

710
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,880
between the Asian and the environment

711
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,679
but the even or the niche is actually

712
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,020
modeling generative model of the agent

713
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,179
as well implicitly um

714
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:08,159
so I think the best I can do that

715
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,720
direction of some really interesting

716
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,500
work on that but it's um certainly

717
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,140
it's not it's it's not something that

718
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,460
plays a central role in my thinking

719
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,480
recently

720
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,140
um yeah so we have the participants

721
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,340
Zoom chat

722
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,600
yeah

723
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,340
a variational approach to Niche

724
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,159
construction yeah I don't know if uh if

725
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,179
Mark has anything to add or anybody else

726
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,080
um

727
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,059
which we're thinking yeah

728
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,500
yeah can I just check one thing you

729
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,820
asked I I don't know how much I need to

730
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,340
add here but um did you think that the

731
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,279
wall was reducing free energy relative

732
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,380
to the climber did you say that that's

733
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,659
right so my

734
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,000
so I don't know how that can that be the

735
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,279
case can that be the case the wall the

736
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,340
wall is a thing is maintaining itself

737
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,159
and I mean relative brain self-evidence

738
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:01,320
thing right yeah but but it's not really

739
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,720
a duet of one here it's not like it has

740
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,400
a generative model that's deep where

741
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,440
it's modeling the climber modeling it

742
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,360
like the same way as tango dancers do

743
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,679
the Tango the a Tango Duo are are are

744
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,200
having Cooperative flow States because

745
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,659
each movement opens a Vista of possible

746
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,580
error minimizing opportunities for the

747
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,580
partner who in turn opens of this set of

748
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,200
error minimizing opportunities for the

749
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,360
partner yeah and backwards and forwards

750
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,940
into this ever opening expanse of

751
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,580
affordance capabilities but an inanimate

752
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,080
object in an agent don't really have

753
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,520
that same Dynamic so I was wondering

754
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,440
what you were thinking there so my

755
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,200
thinking was is that this kind of bleeds

756
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,559
into the notion of fluidity of

757
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,940
affordances in the kind of gibsonian

758
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,039
sense and the fluidity of Concepts so I

759
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,679
agree in this in the sense of physical

760
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:51,360
self-evidencing it needs to model the

761
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,380
rain it needs to model the physical

762
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,320
environment so as to maintain itself but

763
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,679
what about as it's a it's a it's

764
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,220
because

765
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,200
so a sheer rock face is not a climbing

766
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,580
wall and that's because it doesn't

767
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,260
self-evidence as a climbing wall it

768
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,820
doesn't offer the affordances to be

769
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,440
climbed that's why I was kind of

770
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,240
referring to which is that affordances

771
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,000
change based on the on the agent Arena

772
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,960
relationship right your cause

773
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,340
affordances change whether it's working

774
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,200
or broken down similarly the climbing

775
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,820
will changes whether it's got footholds

776
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,440
handholds or whether it's just a sheer

777
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,120
rock face that was my thinking it seems

778
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,980
slightly spooky it seems slightly spooky

779
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,840
to me that we'd think of the Wireless

780
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,600
self-evidising in that way I think I

781
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,039
think the language that we tend to use

782
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,860
because Julian kivocene Eric reidfeld

783
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,779
um you know the Bloomberg and folks

784
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,880
often use the idea of affordances and

785
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,500
Fields of affordances in the active

786
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,779
inference way

787
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:47,880
um the the radical end of the pool there

788
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,039
is typically that the affordances don't

789
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,600
only happen on the agent side but rather

790
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,059
happen from a dynamic of the changing

791
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,940
volatile environment and the generative

792
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,399
model of the agent and that their their

793
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,220
collaborating in Dynamic ongoing ways

794
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,380
such that the affordances are emergent

795
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,480
between them that's certainly that

796
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,820
certainly seems right to me the the idea

797
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,200
to push it a little bit further and

798
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,000
think about the wall self-evidencing

799
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,100
it's a it's a I think it's a step too

800
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,779
spooky for me

801
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,820
um I think I would I would feel safer

802
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,220
safer a little bit closer to thinking

803
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,500
about yeah the affordances are changing

804
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,020
relative to the Dynamics of the wall

805
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,100
um but I don't know what it would mean

806
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,919
for the wall to be evidencing

807
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,539
the climber or itself yeah there's uh

808
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,179
just to kind of that's instead a ton of

809
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:39,659
thoughts well

810
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:44,360
a little longer on um

811
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:47,100
affordances because there's this really

812
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,059
nice distinction in their work between

813
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:52,980
uh what they call well I'm not sure if

814
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,480
they I think I think that the term

815
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,419
landscape of affordances is a little bit

816
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,980
older but they make this distinction

817
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,080
between a landscape of affordances and a

818
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,700
field of affordances

819
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,700
and I think the reason this is it's

820
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,200
really important to get on the table is

821
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,419
because it this distinction is kind of

822
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:12,720
directly targeting the dynamic shifting

823
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,200
very affective nature of affordances so

824
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,179
on the one hand you have this landscape

825
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,000
of affordances that is relatively static

826
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,399
so so right now my landscape of

827
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,340
affordances is is Brighton

828
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,899
um and that's the landscape of

829
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,220
affordances in that sense it's not

830
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,419
really going to change very rapidly

831
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:32,220
unless I kind of jump on a plane and go

832
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,200
somewhere else but the field of

833
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,080
affordances has this thoroughly kind of

834
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,799
normative affective character to it so

835
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,200
depending on my internal State at any

836
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,940
given time depending on my expectations

837
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,700
or my desires say my field of

838
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,799
affordances is going to shift very very

839
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,320
rapidly and it's so not just not just

840
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,179
predicated on my internal state but also

841
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:56,640
kind of contextual cues as well so if

842
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,899
something were to happen in the

843
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:00,120
environment that was afforded very high

844
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,919
Precision waiting then that's likely to

845
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,520
shift my feel affordances significantly

846
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,480
um

847
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,820
I think that the reason that I'm kind of

848
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,700
emphasizing this to darius's point is

849
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,380
and and kind of building on what Mark

850
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,480
said it it doesn't seem like this

851
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,100
distinction at least would apply from

852
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,140
the perspective of the perspective of

853
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,080
the wall say because this kind of

854
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,779
affectivity and normativity just isn't a

855
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,840
feature of the world's experience of the

856
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,940
world and also to kind of run with that

857
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,399
the I mean affordances perhaps you could

858
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,440
say a bit more about how you would kind

859
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,840
of think about this Darius because

860
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,700
affordances are kind of opportunities

861
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,220
for actions okay so it's they're they're

862
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,100
kind of uh I I like that there's some

863
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,480
debate about this but I like to think of

864
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,159
them as like a relational property

865
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,899
between of like this you have the

866
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:50,519
skilled capabilities of an embodied

867
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,260
agent and then you have some feature of

868
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,419
the environment so I think when you're

869
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,220
thinking in from the perspective of the

870
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,840
wall you have the features of the

871
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,340
environment because you have the

872
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,860
embodied characteristics of the agent

873
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,200
are kind of playing that role but it's

874
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,600
not clear to me what the the kind of

875
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,520
skilled capabilities of the wall is it

876
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,440
so yeah if you could just say a bit more

877
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,859
about that yeah I mean it may be the

878
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:15,540
case as you pointed out that actually

879
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,520
the the technical term affordance as

880
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,260
being obtuse faction has misplaced her

881
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,320
okay so I can see I again this is a lot

882
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,659
of this I've been formulating having

883
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:27,780
read this very new paper by um Ramsey

884
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,219
and colleagues on Bayesian mechanics of

885
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:31,440
physics of them by beliefs where he

886
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,960
really Rams home this point that the

887
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,060
system the generative model is the

888
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,739
system of the kind of statistic uh

889
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,839
stochastic differential equations across

890
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,460
the state space so across the mark of

891
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,560
blanca across the particle with its

892
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,080
Market blanket and the external States

893
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,179
and that is the system which is in that

894
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,639
system itself is in the business of

895
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,619
reducing free energy so it's not just

896
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:55,500
the active inference agent yeah the

897
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,420
whole system yeah which is embedded in

898
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,740
the whole system of other things and so

899
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,940
that was my general thinking is that

900
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,580
yeah just on the prerequisite that these

901
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,640
systems exist just on that aprily Axiom

902
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,820
there has to be some kind of self

903
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,859
evidencing of that system itself so

904
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,140
maybe affordances is the wrong word I

905
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,960
yeah yeah that might be the trick right

906
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,180
there as soon as you provoke affordance

907
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,000
yeah you're provoking phenomenology and

908
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,200
so now we're not talking just about

909
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,180
statistical variations now we're talking

910
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,460
about lived experience that might be

911
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,320
that might be the the linchpin right

912
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,300
there I think I think that is right yeah

913
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,980
and I and I would say I think Darius

914
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,420
you're absolutely on the right track and

915
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,000
you're in I mean there is this ambiguity

916
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,740
about affordances but aside from that I

917
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,760
think you're absolutely right I mean

918
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,720
it's

919
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,960
I it's just nonsensical to think about

920
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,140
an agent's absent an environment under

921
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,020
active inference you have to it it is

922
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,820
this agent environment system in its

923
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,440
totality that's minimizing free energy

924
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,359
they have to be they have to be taken

925
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,099
together as one and I know Abel you've

926
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:57,960
had your hand up for a little while

927
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,040
though do you want to is there something

928
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,640
you wanted to add

929
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,760
yep uh do you hear me well we do I do

930
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,680
anyway okay

931
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,060
so

932
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,800
um about the references World Arena

933
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,000
foreign season

934
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,640
um basically the symmetry of hydroxine

935
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,740
environment is a property of active in

936
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,839
France well of the financial principle

937
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:22,320
so if you buy a friendly principle and

938
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,320
you also buy that it entails that agent

939
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,960
have affordensies or any proximal notion

940
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,980
then you also buy that rolls as uh

941
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,359
forenses

942
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,579
so there are basically three position

943
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,680
you can have on that

944
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,800
one is that active inference is correct

945
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,780
well a [ __ ] affordances and they do

946
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,300
self-villiancing which I would not go

947
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,260
with

948
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,720
another uh option is that you have

949
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,700
basically um Devol in the details so for

950
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,079
example Maybe

951
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,300
the adjunct environment is not the wall

952
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,540
it's something that is broader like Gaia

953
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,420
system whatever and it just happens it

954
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,540
includes the wall but it is not the wall

955
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,780
and it does do self-balancing

956
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,940
and the third is that active inference

957
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,460
is wrong uh we don't have affordances

958
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,859
based on whatever is the follow

959
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,380
presentation of active in France

960
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,020
and I would go in that direction

961
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,720
of this phenology phenomenology stuff so

962
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,160
we have a

963
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,920
I I would say philosophical evidence in

964
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,200
the sense that they are denying this

965
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,760
would lead to nonsense but the

966
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,339
information is based on observation

967
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,880
and some system do observing much more

968
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,400
actively than others and maybe it's a

969
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,500
good thing to have in your formalism I'd

970
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,359
say uh so um you have maybe a stronger

971
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,099
case for uh the way uh if

972
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:57,480
are constructed in the quantum

973
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,420
formulation of the fep if there is such

974
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,760
a thing which like Chris Fields someone

975
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,000
who we should Baseline believe claims

976
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,900
there is

977
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,119
because then you have formalization

978
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,940
which is not in terms of Dynamics per C

979
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,260
so causal constraints but observation

980
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,079
and indirectly phenomenology maybe you

981
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,520
have something that is stronger there

982
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,480
but

983
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,780
right now the uh link oh and yeah sorry

984
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,780
there is actually a bunch of people who

985
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,140
have a quite good hold on science which

986
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,740
are the

987
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,220
SE

988
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,520
based on the ecological activity and

989
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,800
commission on one hand and between

990
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,960
cognition and the metabolism the

991
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,400
constitution of the living thing that

992
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,320
cognites on the other

993
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,540
and one of their

994
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,839
definition of agency cognition pick one

995
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,060
entails

996
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,339
um

997
00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:01,020
interactional asymmetry I think is the

998
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,259
word

999
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,300
that maybe something we would need to

1000
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,640
translate into active inference well

1001
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,280
into the fep for active inference to

1002
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,220
have a strong grip over this affordance

1003
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,060
thing until then we have a kind of hand

1004
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,119
waving way it relates it to

1005
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,940
more conceptual approaches uh that are

1006
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,680
related to an active and ecological

1007
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,400
approach to psychology and um

1008
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,339
yeah the formalism lags basically behind

1009
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,339
the concept for now

1010
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:41,760
sorry for the long talk

1011
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,180
no that was great much appreciated

1012
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,160
this um

1013
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,560
anybody else want to come in on uh

1014
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,020
question of affordances because I know

1015
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,260
um affordance has played a fairly

1016
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:59,000
substantial role in the lecture so

1017
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,599
anybody

1018
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,700
the questions related to affordances or

1019
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,440
you know action perception affordances

1020
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,079
then Now's the Time

1021
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,079
yeah I do have one but it's not well

1022
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,400
structured yeah

1023
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,800
I've been thinking about for the last

1024
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,680
months because I I started to deepen the

1025
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,140
artificial intelligence field up coming

1026
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,400
from a Humanities background and

1027
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,560
philosophical background so I'm mixing

1028
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,260
many things in this period

1029
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,119
mainly following the the active

1030
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,700
inference as a as a Crosser between many

1031
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,260
disciplines that and this is very

1032
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,780
beautiful about the framework and I was

1033
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,760
super curious about the um the question

1034
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,220
proposed by Darius and I was then

1035
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,200
thinking about

1036
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,540
now we're actually facing a

1037
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,940
a new environment and a new landscape in

1038
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,940
which we're like interacting with the

1039
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,119
term

1040
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,079
comes the next turn actually generating

1041
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,940
over revolutionary time and

1042
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,740
synchronizing

1043
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,339
a logical alien agencies operating

1044
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:13,200
within our

1045
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,660
landscape and field of performances

1046
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,520
um so I think there's

1047
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,800
a lot of really interesting work to

1048
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,200
potentially be done there I will take

1049
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,060
the opportunity to shamelessly plug a

1050
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,339
pre-print that Mark and I have released

1051
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:29,520
recently where um we one thing so one

1052
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,839
thing that I'm really interested in that

1053
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,640
I can kind of speak with some confidence

1054
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,280
on is the fact that I I do think there's

1055
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,680
a point at which the theory of

1056
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,300
affordances or the language of

1057
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,359
affordances starts to break down

1058
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:45,359
legit

1059
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,700
so the preprint that I'll show around

1060
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,020
is looking at and um ambient technology

1061
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,460
specifically so this is technology that

1062
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,640
you the whole kind of impetus behind its

1063
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,040
design and conceptualization is that the

1064
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,839
user doesn't have to actually do

1065
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,660
anything so it precedes the user

1066
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,820
pragmatically and epistemically it knows

1067
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,500
what kinds of things you want it to do

1068
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,000
and it just does them in the background

1069
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,660
and it works by shifting kind of it it

1070
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,760
subtly shifts the material environment

1071
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,800
such that it impacts your field of

1072
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,320
affordances in real time

1073
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,480
and and the argument that we make in

1074
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,920
that paper is essentially that the

1075
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,420
affordancers approach doesn't really

1076
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,460
work for this and that we need to kind

1077
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,500
of think again so

1078
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,660
um yeah I mean I think that that might

1079
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:37,079
be it but like

1080
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:40,140
how to conceptualize generative AI for

1081
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,880
example under the affordances framework

1082
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,380
I'm not sure I don't know anybody that's

1083
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,000
done any work on that but it would be it

1084
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,079
would certainly make a really cool

1085
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,320
project

1086
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,460
you are making it better and right now

1087
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,099
when was that

1088
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,680
you are making it right now I know

1089
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,380
because you sent me the paper to review

1090
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,339
oh yeah

1091
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,200
thank you thank you so um we were

1092
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,720
looking at we so we uh

1093
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,480
or early stages of a a paper on the role

1094
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,119
of um generative AI in classrooms

1095
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,099
um so from the perspective of

1096
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:19,380
thinking about what kinds of affordances

1097
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,859
generative AI represent in a in a

1098
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:24,240
learning environment

1099
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,859
um particularly we're kind of applying

1100
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:27,720
active inference to classroom design and

1101
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,640
looking at it from the different

1102
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,099
different uh the angles of different

1103
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,800
um educational and pedagogical theories

1104
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,359
um but it's um

1105
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:38,819
very early today with us

1106
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:40,740
yeah this is I suppose it probably

1107
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,960
depends on your view of generative in

1108
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,220
general I mean it depends whether you

1109
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,800
would consider it a real cognitive agent

1110
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,060
or not

1111
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,859
I think I think some people are more

1112
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,660
inclined to think of it as you know this

1113
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,760
thing this is a thing that has agency it

1114
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,300
has real understanding it has like

1115
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,579
um you know and other people are maybe

1116
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:00,960
less inclined to think of it in those

1117
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,760
terms and I think that might be that

1118
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,740
might bear significantly on on how you

1119
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,020
think of it

1120
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,700
yeah that's super cool that basically

1121
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,460
the last project you mentioned is very

1122
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,680
very in line with my PhD project right

1123
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,380
now because my main PhD project is our

1124
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,660
European findings and it's about the AI

1125
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,640
for personalized education and I'm

1126
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,560
trying to follow it through the the

1127
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,119
active in French framework from a

1128
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,220
multi-level perspective

1129
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,160
so yeah very cool yeah we should we

1130
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,240
should probably talk more about that

1131
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,540
yeah

1132
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,980
okay uh Darius

1133
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,079
yeah I wanted to ask I mean this may be

1134
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,599
directed more marks I know this is kind

1135
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,359
of his work in terms of

1136
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,720
um slopes of uncertainty and about doing

1137
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,280
better than expected at reducing

1138
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,380
prediction error over time

1139
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,819
I was wondering kind of how the

1140
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:56,400
architecture of that is built into the

1141
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,160
into the particle into the into the

1142
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,140
genitive model because we have the kind

1143
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,480
of for me there's I don't know if it's

1144
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,660
an hour and out sort of conflict but we

1145
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,400
have these kind of implicit priors that

1146
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,440
we're going to fulfill certain

1147
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,300
expectations or minimize prediction now

1148
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,060
regarding certain things right so

1149
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,460
homeostatic priors or happiness

1150
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,160
well-being whatever it is but then your

1151
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,540
claim is that we have a higher order

1152
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,400
beliefs the higher order predictions

1153
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,980
that over and above that I also need to

1154
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,560
become I also need to do well better

1155
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,780
than expected a reducing prediction

1156
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,440
error over time so is there a it's still

1157
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,180
quite fuzzy in my mind but is there a

1158
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,300
kind of potential conflict there between

1159
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,240
the general priors that the system has

1160
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,319
and then go actually in a sense

1161
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:47,640
violating those Expectations by going

1162
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,740
over and above them which itself

1163
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,660
constitutes an expectation how do you

1164
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,800
kind of resolve that tension

1165
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,780
yeah that's interesting

1166
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,460
um but this is very much in Ben's

1167
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,599
wheelhouse too

1168
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,700
um Ben and I have been working on slopey

1169
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,940
stuff for uh almost as long as I've been

1170
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,859
doing

1171
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:09,980
um

1172
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:19,220
um

1173
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,579
active charge

1174
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,500
what was his original paper called we'll

1175
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,700
get it we'll get it up they do a really

1176
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,500
good job of showing technically where

1177
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,359
this sits within

1178
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:33,359
um uh the parametric model

1179
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,819
um Laura senved Smith's paper on

1180
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:38,819
metacognition also does this by showing

1181
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:41,040
you have these you have these depths of

1182
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,319
modeling where models above are modeling

1183
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,420
models below okay and optimizing over

1184
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,280
those models below so we have some good

1185
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,099
computational backbone for thinking

1186
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,720
um for not only thinking that this is

1187
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,859
the case but

1188
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:56,099
beginning to express how it does the

1189
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:57,720
work it does

1190
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,339
um so let's let's leave that for digging

1191
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:01,260
into it though technically on sort of on

1192
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,839
our own let me say sort of a at a higher

1193
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,060
more abstract level still hopefully it's

1194
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,380
useful

1195
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,380
um it's not weird to think that this

1196
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,060
kind of anticipatory system is not only

1197
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,099
making predictions about the world but

1198
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,900
it's also

1199
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,420
um part of what it's predicting is how

1200
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,060
fast or slow how efficient it is in

1201
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,339
particular contexts at resolving certain

1202
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:25,440
kinds of errors that that's a perfectly

1203
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,819
fine thing to think that we're also

1204
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:30,540
predicting slopes of Engagement

1205
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,400
and then and then all we're saying then

1206
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,980
is system also pays attention to when

1207
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,540
those expectations are breached it's

1208
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,520
learning from those breaches that's that

1209
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,599
should just be the bread and butter for

1210
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,060
what the system does anyway so Precision

1211
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,220
is a second order is a second order

1212
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,980
process in much the same way Precision

1213
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,099
is about how well uh how how reliable

1214
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:53,400
are lower level predictions

1215
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,520
um and then using that

1216
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,240
um that amount to toggle how impactful

1217
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,700
either errors or predictions are so

1218
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,020
we've already got baked into the system

1219
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,359
right from early days this idea that the

1220
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:07,560
system is not only making predictions

1221
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,319
but monitoring its own predictive

1222
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,160
processing regimes and then toggling uh

1223
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,500
based on how reliable those those

1224
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,420
substreams are

1225
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,339
um all we're adding here is

1226
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:21,480
um you know when we first when we first

1227
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,280
thought about those mechanisms one thing

1228
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,480
that can happen this is just good for

1229
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,380
everybody who's interested in active

1230
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,640
inference because I bump into this with

1231
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,319
my students all the time

1232
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,180
when we say something like Precision

1233
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,040
waiting

1234
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:32,940
um

1235
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,800
a tendency to think it's the same

1236
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:40,680
so we go to find what is precision like

1237
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,619
where's the biological instead or I

1238
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:46,140
guess Precision waiting when we actually

1239
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,240
get into a bio system and we look for

1240
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,460
these things the truth is precision is

1241
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,020
going to be weighted in lots of

1242
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,160
different ways I mean that's the real

1243
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,440
Frontier of This research is to actually

1244
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,180
find how these things are instantiated

1245
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,380
and the answer is going to be

1246
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,880
multifarious I mean it's going to be

1247
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,960
you're going to have Precision

1248
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,220
adjustments happening throughout the

1249
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,780
system in lots of ways it could be

1250
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,520
synchrony and asynchkenies and

1251
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,680
desynchranies between systems it can be

1252
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,480
neuromodulatory chemicals it can be

1253
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,579
structural structural

1254
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:14,280
um uh shapes within the brain I mean

1255
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,859
Precision is going to be set in in lots

1256
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:19,800
of different ways so

1257
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,000
um

1258
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,599
uh uh all all that we're pointing out

1259
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:27,540
here is is that one of the ways that

1260
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,880
Precision is being set one of the ways

1261
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,819
that the system is tracking how

1262
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:35,220
efficient it is and then upping or

1263
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,760
lowering the amount of impact

1264
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,700
um error signals or predictions have is

1265
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,200
that it's happening in an embodied way

1266
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,560
so we've looked over to the effect

1267
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,339
Active search and and lo and behold

1268
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:51,720
there are all these signatures that we

1269
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,280
were looking for for this kind of for

1270
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,220
this part of the Machinery so

1271
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,140
um yeah so not weird that the system is

1272
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,819
tracking its own regularities and

1273
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:01,500
adjusting that was baked in right from

1274
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,400
the beginning

1275
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,440
how it does that

1276
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,180
that's one of the Frontiers it's going

1277
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,040
to happen in lots of different ways lo

1278
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,920
and behold affect the Dynamics the shoe

1279
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,380
fits they look like they do that stuff

1280
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,300
and then you bring it to the lab and you

1281
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,980
go back to like reward prediction error

1282
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,740
research and sure enough neuromodulatory

1283
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,619
chemicals reward systems are tuning

1284
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,359
affective Dynamics relative to better

1285
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:26,400
than and worse than slopes of

1286
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,740
uncertainty management that's exactly

1287
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,180
what we would expect given the

1288
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,400
computational model

1289
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,619
um so then it's an easy it was an easy

1290
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:36,720
next step to start saying well look

1291
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,640
there's one of the way

1292
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,440
it's a Precision that there's one of the

1293
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,700
ways that after

1294
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,300
effects

1295
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,020
[Laughter]

1296
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:48,680
system now just notice there

1297
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,059
and now the only thing the affect the

1298
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:52,619
system is doing we never want to say we

1299
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:54,119
never sort of we're careful not to be

1300
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:56,700
reductionist to say oh affect is always

1301
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,500
aerodynamics I don't think that's right

1302
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,359
I think it's that aerodynamics are

1303
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,700
expressed in part effectively and they

1304
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,440
have this impact on the system

1305
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,940
um that we can that we that we've known

1306
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,220
about for a long time even from just a

1307
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,260
reward prediction error um literature

1308
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,839
does that help or was that a bit is that

1309
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:14,040
okay

1310
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:18,900
yeah yeah yeah uh yeah uh just to just

1311
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,819
to add two two things really quickly

1312
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:23,220
there um because I know time is kind of

1313
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,480
catching up with this uh I would

1314
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,579
emphasize as well like just as a kind of

1315
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,859
General point the one of the things I

1316
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:29,940
really like about the work on

1317
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,160
aerodynamics and affect is it has this

1318
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,640
nice kind of broad capture of the kinds

1319
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,200
of affectivity that agents can

1320
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,819
experience so we're not just when we

1321
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:40,500
talk about affectivity we're not just

1322
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,079
talking about full-blooded emotions or

1323
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:45,839
even just moods but um we're talking

1324
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,940
about what is it one of the things I

1325
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,619
kind of Drew attention to in the lecture

1326
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:51,000
was Matthew ratcliffe's work on

1327
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,040
existential feelings which I think is

1328
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,440
just such a um that the connection

1329
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,119
between active inference and

1330
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,099
phenomenology that you find in some of

1331
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,500
this work is just insanely powerful and

1332
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,000
it's one of the things that really drew

1333
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,160
me into the framework

1334
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,160
um the second thing just build

1335
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,800
um

1336
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,819
one thing that I don't think I mentioned

1337
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:13,680
in the lecture is uh active inferences

1338
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,300
it has been described as a

1339
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,940
quintessentially metacognitive framework

1340
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,760
so you have kind of built into the

1341
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,280
architecture you have expectations over

1342
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,319
expected so you have kind of predictions

1343
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:28,380
about predictions and this has proved to

1344
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,220
be

1345
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,900
um just you know again just phenomenally

1346
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,700
useful for thinking about certain

1347
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,000
aspects of phenomenology as well so

1348
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,920
um yeah I think that these are these are

1349
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,300
like real strengths of the framework

1350
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:47,660
okay

1351
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,480
um I don't know how we're doing for time

1352
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,420
are we are we strictly limited on or can

1353
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,900
we we are not as far as I know

1354
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,500
Danielle

1355
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,400
well

1356
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,319
um I can probably do I'm definitely do

1357
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:05,640
another 15

1358
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,619
um if anybody has any more questions

1359
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:09,240
and people I should say as well we're

1360
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,619
not that doesn't mean that we're all

1361
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:12,300
held captive

1362
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,640
um to my time frame so if people if

1363
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,200
people do need to leave within the next

1364
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,520
five or ten minutes that's absolutely

1365
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,619
fine but um I'm certainly happy to to

1366
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:21,000
carry on if anybody has any more

1367
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,319
questions or comments

1368
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,160
um if if no one else has got any I would

1369
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,680
quite like to go back to uh earlier in

1370
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,760
the discussion you were talking about

1371
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,819
the value of uncertainty

1372
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:38,640
um because uh

1373
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,160
in organizations in which I'm working

1374
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,000
with

1375
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,099
uh we often have conversations about

1376
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:47,339
uncertainty and what we find is over

1377
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:48,900
time there tends to be a drift towards

1378
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,240
risk aversion so we're working with a

1379
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,400
large uh International construction

1380
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,859
company at the minute and that they used

1381
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:58,800
to have a culture in which innovation

1382
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,760
um uh was uh was quite well embedded and

1383
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,280
and over time it's kind of drifted

1384
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,079
towards very very risk-averse culture

1385
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,900
where actually rather than learning

1386
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,280
through the process and being able to

1387
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,440
tolerate uncertainty you know around

1388
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,720
opportunities and you know what can be

1389
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,400
accomplished and that kind of the

1390
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,500
valence that comes with uh the intrinsic

1391
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,420
reward I suppose of being able to reduce

1392
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,660
uncertainty about capabilities to a

1393
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,800
situation where they're trying to

1394
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,059
anticipate

1395
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:29,640
all of the risks up front before they

1396
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,859
even get involved in the project so you

1397
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:33,420
know there's some kind of valence switch

1398
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,140
market and you mentioned um David Blaine

1399
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,020
earlier you know and something about the

1400
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,700
context you know there was a switch in

1401
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,859
valence from yeah this is this is a kind

1402
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:46,200
of a play this is a safe thing to do to

1403
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,059
actually know this is you know this has

1404
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:50,520
real consequences so I'm just kind of

1405
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,900
I'd like to explore that a little bit

1406
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,940
more actually if anyone's got kind of

1407
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:59,000
any insights or papers or comments

1408
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,859
yeah so I think that's a really

1409
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:03,420
interesting question actually and I I

1410
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,800
think um

1411
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,260
so it seems like

1412
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,480
one of the things one of the things

1413
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,920
we've been talking about is this

1414
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,020
connection between uncertainty

1415
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,000
prediction over minimization and

1416
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,940
affectivity and individual agents and it

1417
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,559
sounds like what you're asking is like

1418
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:23,880
how does that translate to uh like

1419
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,099
collectives so yeah one of the things

1420
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:27,420
about active inference that we're going

1421
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,280
to see in subsequent weeks is how it

1422
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,119
scales up to kind of larger systems like

1423
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,760
companies or you know groups that are

1424
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,740
trying to achieve some kind of shared

1425
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,940
goal

1426
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,980
um how do you how does the value of

1427
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:43,440
uncertainty translate onto like how is

1428
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,020
it scalable in that sense right is that

1429
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,660
does that be a fair kind of

1430
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,000
yeah I I guess so

1431
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,760
um I I guess it's um

1432
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,680
I mean I

1433
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,260
so uncertainty often when it's talked

1434
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,300
about uncertainties talked about as risk

1435
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,280
which is you know I suppose is you know

1436
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,160
predictions or anticipation of uh

1437
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,720
outcomes that we don't want right

1438
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,599
whereas there's also positive

1439
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,819
uncertainty right you know which is you

1440
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:13,440
know I suppose you know simply stated

1441
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,599
opportunities you know through curiosity

1442
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,960
you know what might we be able to

1443
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,099
achieve you know this kind of novelty

1444
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:21,839
seeking I guess that you know new

1445
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,480
opportunities that we haven't exploited

1446
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,819
um and they're just you know in the kind

1447
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:29,579
of organizational systems uh you know I

1448
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:31,319
think there are various pressures that

1449
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:33,900
cause it but but over time you see these

1450
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,900
cultural shifts towards uh you know a

1451
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,700
very very kind of risk-averse you know

1452
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,079
where you know where the valence is

1453
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,839
obviously quite negative you know you

1454
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,119
know quite an unpleasant feeling for

1455
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:47,540
people and yeah yeah

1456
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,859
this is good this this is right at the

1457
00:56:49,859 --> 00:56:51,420
heart of my current work

1458
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,640
um I'm really interested so you know we

1459
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,099
just had a big stint where active

1460
00:56:56,099 --> 00:56:57,599
inference models were starting to be

1461
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,280
used in computational Psychiatry

1462
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,559
especially for pathological disorders so

1463
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:03,540
addiction depression disassociative

1464
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,480
disorders OCD PTSD

1465
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,339
um it's a really it's quite a it's a

1466
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:11,099
quite um a sexy framework for thinking

1467
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:12,599
about some of the ways the cognitive

1468
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:14,460
system breaks down in the sort of new

1469
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,720
move right now I mean we have a

1470
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,800
collection coming out right now in

1471
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,359
Neuroscience of Consciousness is to

1472
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:19,559
think about these things in terms of

1473
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:20,700
okay

1474
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,099
if we are predictive systems and we have

1475
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:25,260
a sufficiently rich model of how that

1476
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,780
system works in a particular Niche what

1477
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,359
sorts of what sorts of um what sorts of

1478
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:32,160
ways can we intervene on that system in

1479
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,839
order to have positive outcomes rather

1480
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,280
than just modeling what the negative

1481
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,500
outcomes are and I hear that a lot in

1482
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,760
what you're saying now so I'm just going

1483
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,460
to drop one link for you there this is

1484
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,260
Casper hasp again

1485
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,000
um wrote a little a very small paper

1486
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,319
with a nice little model called

1487
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,420
sophisticated affective inference gives

1488
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,579
it a little bot that tends towards

1489
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:51,980
catastrophe

1490
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,660
catastrophizing the future if it's given

1491
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:58,680
if it's given like fun medium fun medium

1492
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:03,119
fun dangerous over time uh it tends to

1493
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,480
it tends to expect the dangerous one

1494
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,940
um uh like after 10 000 iterations it

1495
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,559
basically lives in the worst possible

1496
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,960
scenario which is a nice little this is

1497
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,420
my wife

1498
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:17,220
this is this is most people today you

1499
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,800
know so the question is um I want to

1500
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,020
know given them all model why does that

1501
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,940
happen and what can we be doing to

1502
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,300
intervene and um part of the answer is

1503
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,359
going to be we need to become more

1504
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:32,220
tolerant of uncertainty that's one of

1505
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,420
the things that the system can be better

1506
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,180
or worse at so this just takes the

1507
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,740
computational modeling and then looks to

1508
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:38,640
things that we already know about

1509
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,040
emotional regulation that that's that's

1510
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,140
part of the story

1511
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,940
um so

1512
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,559
um we've done a little bit of work on

1513
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,420
this with our predictive dynamics of

1514
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,040
happiness and well-being and Ryan Smith

1515
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,780
is definitely doing work on this with

1516
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,760
active inference and well-being

1517
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,200
um so definitely check that out if

1518
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,299
you're if you're interested here

1519
00:58:57,299 --> 00:58:58,040
um

1520
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,299
I'll just flag one interesting thing

1521
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:02,460
here that relates just to what we were

1522
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,079
just talking about about layers of

1523
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,400
modeling

1524
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,400
one way you gotta let's say two ways

1525
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,260
there's two ways that a system and it's

1526
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,940
probably gonna be lots but the two that

1527
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,500
come to mind that A system can become

1528
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,020
more tolerant uncertainty is one

1529
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,160
exposure

1530
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,799
so this is why exposure therapy might be

1531
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:22,200
useful for our kind of a system you want

1532
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,660
to expose the system to volatility at

1533
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,520
the lower and middle levels of the

1534
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,880
hierarchy and have it turn out okay so

1535
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,200
that this one of the things that the

1536
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,420
system can come to predict is not only

1537
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,760
you know particular outcomes but it can

1538
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,220
also predict how much error is involved

1539
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,500
in particular outcomes so for instance

1540
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,980
when I used to give a pro talk I was

1541
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,260
always really nervous

1542
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,640
um and I don't know if that ever really

1543
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,579
went away but I've had so much exposure

1544
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:52,859
to the anxiety of giving a professional

1545
00:59:52,859 --> 00:59:55,020
talk that basically I don't notice it

1546
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,700
anymore but if you were to ask me at the

1547
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,200
beginning of my talk

1548
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,780
Mark right now what's your phenomenology

1549
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,880
and I sort of meditatively looked I'd

1550
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,280
probably say yeah I'm nervous but if you

1551
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,599
hadn't have said that and you was like

1552
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:08,280
hey what's up I've been like oh yeah I'm

1553
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,839
great like it's all good I don't even

1554
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,579
notice it anymore that's because the

1555
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:14,720
system knows that I have errors

1556
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,460
but as soon as I start talking they drop

1557
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,799
away and because I know the arc that

1558
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:21,540
evens error in the system it becomes

1559
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,920
non-newsworthy it's no longer

1560
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,299
interesting volatility to be tracking

1561
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:27,059
that's just from exposure okay so what's

1562
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:28,920
happening is you're having errors at a

1563
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,540
lower middle level that a higher level

1564
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:33,059
is now modeling saying when we come here

1565
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:34,920
we should expect this Arc of error same

1566
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,319
thing when you work out like real gym

1567
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:41,000
routes they can feel good

1568
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,559
the legal system right but at the higher

1569
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:51,900
level it's now learned not only that

1570
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,240
that has a natural Arc but that that's a

1571
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,799
good sign at a higher level so now

1572
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:57,900
you're getting a positive you're getting

1573
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,720
positive prediction error slope high and

1574
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,540
negative prediction air slope low okay

1575
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:08,099
so one is exposure two you can model

1576
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:10,740
your own responses this is something Ben

1577
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:13,500
and I work on with um horror movies

1578
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,680
um uh you can you can you can take an

1579
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:20,160
active role in mindfully observing your

1580
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,359
own reactions to volatility and um this

1581
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:26,280
comes up in our paper on horror we've

1582
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,420
already dropped the link today if you

1583
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,680
want to check it out something really

1584
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,420
special happens when the system models

1585
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,119
its own reaction to volatility it starts

1586
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:35,099
to learn that um even reactions to

1587
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:37,680
volatility uh don't need to be um they

1588
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,000
don't need to be compounded up into

1589
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,280
dangers that it's okay it's okay to be

1590
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,020
uncertain at certain levels of the

1591
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,540
system so how that translates into

1592
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,700
business I'm not sure other than I know

1593
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,520
tolerance to uncertainty is a marker of

1594
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,220
business success and

1595
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:57,299
um I suspect the framework in a fit lots

1596
01:01:57,299 --> 01:01:59,760
of mindfulness mindfulness work about

1597
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,520
learning to tolerate uncertainty

1598
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,260
is there anything about

1599
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,960
um the role of language in kind of

1600
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,660
modulating those metacognitive oh it's

1601
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,900
good if I'm I Was preparing an answer on

1602
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,119
that specifically and I was nervously

1603
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:18,020
waiting for an opportunity

1604
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:20,400
so

1605
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,079
um

1606
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,400
like meta in terms of evolutionary

1607
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,440
cognitive archeology we don't know when

1608
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,079
language emerged but we do know that's

1609
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:33,480
uh let's say an encouraging semantic

1610
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,040
system so

1611
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,020
you can build things in language and you

1612
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,760
can expect things in the world to

1613
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,920
correspond to things in language

1614
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,200
so for example if you that's abstract as

1615
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,819
I say it's abstract but you can for

1616
01:02:44,819 --> 01:02:48,020
example have a self-identity

1617
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,059
French I'm a French

1618
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,220
and I communicate with the expectation

1619
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,740
that are underneath with other people

1620
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,420
and that means we're communicate our

1621
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,280
nose so so we have specific expectation

1622
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,720
of what we will

1623
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,720
do and those expectations they become

1624
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,240
embedded in specific symbolic markers

1625
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,760
that are embedded in language

1626
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,540
and uh something that uh like this thing

1627
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:16,140
that it was strongly evoked in my mind

1628
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,059
when you talked of three words to answer

1629
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:19,500
that is that um

1630
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,540
as far as documented history goes

1631
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:27,900
uh Europeans well indo-europeans they

1632
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,079
are pretty strong on the idea that

1633
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:34,280
things of a nature and they act lawfully

1634
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,260
and their nature and their laws they

1635
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,059
somehow correspond to linguistic

1636
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:42,140
categories so I can say stuff like

1637
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:45,420
chickens quark and that's a proper

1638
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,540
explanation of what are chicken and why

1639
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,040
they quack

1640
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,040
and if you look in Chinese philosophy as

1641
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:56,280
far as written history goes you have a

1642
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,200
major Accent on

1643
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,540
way way so

1644
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,540
um a poor translation would be uh

1645
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,079
effortless action

1646
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,119
closer translation would be uh action

1647
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:10,440
without action

1648
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,680
so it's a form it's something that is

1649
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,079
quite close to the phenomenology of flow

1650
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,900
in that you observe yourself doing

1651
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,960
things and you do not apply a conscious

1652
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,280
effort to the flow of what you're doing

1653
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,220
and that looks like something that is uh

1654
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,380
closer to the phenomenology would expect

1655
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:33,180
if you apply you know recursive

1656
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,420
proactive condition with less or less

1657
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:39,059
heavy or more effectively integrated

1658
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:39,720
um

1659
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,359
symbolic occurring like use of language

1660
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:44,160
as something that you actually expect to

1661
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,260
be meaningful and to constraints from

1662
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:47,700
your actions

1663
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:52,879
and marginally I'd expect very strongly

1664
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,160
do you expect that linguistic categories

1665
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,619
will map and what you build with it so I

1666
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:00,240
don't know self-identities plans

1667
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,000
whatever will map cleanly onto What You

1668
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,280
observe you will be very very unsure

1669
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,660
about things because that does not

1670
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:09,059
happen usually

1671
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:10,020
um

1672
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:14,280
and yeah um besides uh Grant discourse

1673
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,280
on interpreter preference traits which

1674
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,680
are usually not that constructive

1675
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,180
I'd

1676
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,040
um

1677
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,079
yeah sorry I got lost because I did not

1678
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:27,540
I that's a speech tonight can I let me

1679
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,400
just say one thing before before we move

1680
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,460
off this point uh a simple way that

1681
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,319
language might help is by invoking

1682
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,660
cognitive flexibility so

1683
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,099
um oftentimes we think about the

1684
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:39,839
management of error being either

1685
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,180
updating predictions or acting on the

1686
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,040
world those are the that's the dyad

1687
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,020
usually what it overlooks is the third

1688
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:48,059
one which is we can also manage

1689
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:51,059
volatility by redeploying Precision in a

1690
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:52,020
better way

1691
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,880
so rather than just updating your model

1692
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,440
to fit the world or updating the world

1693
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,359
to fit your model you can just change

1694
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:00,180
the set of what matters so that you're

1695
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,859
not you're not really updating the model

1696
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:03,240
and you're not really changing the world

1697
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,380
you're just changing the problem

1698
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:06,540
landscape and that's something language

1699
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,700
allows us to do it's maybe one of the

1700
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,619
one of the really amazing things that

1701
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:13,079
language allows us to do is we can use

1702
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:15,359
language to bootstrap that kind of

1703
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,700
precision adjustment so if the train

1704
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,700
doesn't come on time we both notice it

1705
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,680
okay and we feel bad that's perceptual

1706
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,140
updating we might go and get a taxi

1707
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:28,140
that's active updating but I might just

1708
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,460
say to you

1709
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,440
um wow look isn't that isn't it lovely

1710
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,640
that now we get a little bit more time

1711
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,079
to read our book or to continue our

1712
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,460
conversation or let's finish our coffee

1713
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,319
with a little bit of ease I mean we get

1714
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:39,539
an extra 20 minutes now even just saying

1715
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:41,819
that redeploys Precision over the

1716
01:06:41,819 --> 01:06:44,700
problem space now the train being late

1717
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,220
isn't volatility in the system

1718
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,440
the train being late is signaling to the

1719
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,819
system that a better than expected slope

1720
01:06:50,819 --> 01:06:52,859
has been achieved isn't that so

1721
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:55,319
interesting the exact same occurrence is

1722
01:06:55,319 --> 01:06:58,020
either undigestible volatility right

1723
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,520
like you're gonna be late oh my goodness

1724
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,559
or it's an opportunity for an

1725
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,299
improvement in the system which is now

1726
01:07:03,299 --> 01:07:05,160
you get more time with the person that

1727
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,260
you're um taking the train with and that

1728
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,599
was just a matter of linguistic um

1729
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,359
perturbance of the way that Precision is

1730
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:14,460
being deployed so I if you're looking at

1731
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:15,900
if you wanted to dig into the research

1732
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,400
here I would look up cognitive

1733
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,099
flexibility and language or coaching

1734
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:21,900
cognitive flexibility is such a good

1735
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,260
point here

1736
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,440
um

1737
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,260
so the uh you have a paper by any clerk

1738
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,660
on uh this specific and current role of

1739
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,400
language and something it entails is

1740
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,099
that basically you got like if the

1741
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:36,900
active influence picture is correct you

1742
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,180
will flexibly predict to flow in the uh

1743
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,140
interceptive proprioceptive

1744
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,579
exterosceptivist not even a thing space

1745
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:47,039
and that is that is what Builder

1746
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,720
integrating experience integrated you

1747
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,339
know cognition

1748
01:07:50,339 --> 01:07:52,740
and language it adds another layer of

1749
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,180
complexity if you can just talk to

1750
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,799
yourself in your head that is another

1751
01:07:55,799 --> 01:07:57,960
dimension that you can predict and that

1752
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,299
can be coherent or incoherent with uh

1753
01:08:00,299 --> 01:08:01,260
you won't

1754
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,599
and so that is an extremely powerful and

1755
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,039
current system because I just have to

1756
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,980
like tell a plant to myself and boom

1757
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:10,859
that uh pushes me nudges me nicely for

1758
01:08:10,859 --> 01:08:12,900
the plan but then you can have a

1759
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,700
different level of meta expectation over

1760
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,399
how language corresponds to reality and

1761
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:20,819
I'd say a very very strong factor of you

1762
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:22,620
know a version of coincidentally is

1763
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:25,020
whether you expect your plans or your

1764
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,479
linguistic structure to nicely map them

1765
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,460
to reality because it will not happen

1766
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,799
but if you expect strongly that it will

1767
01:08:31,799 --> 01:08:34,020
be the case you will have to make it

1768
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:36,600
happen somehow and here you will adapt

1769
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,179
rigid strategies and you will

1770
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:42,000
like lose flexibility but also language

1771
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,679
and sorry for flexibility to be the case

1772
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,238
in the first place so it's about

1773
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:49,698
coupling between dimension of cognition

1774
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,799
yeah and I would just uh just kind of

1775
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,020
this

1776
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:58,080
risk and danger are two things that I've

1777
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,060
been really interested in across a kind

1778
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,799
of variety of different contexts and I I

1779
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:04,339
would say

1780
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,420
some of the things that have been said

1781
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,698
like the kind of how you can

1782
01:09:08,698 --> 01:09:11,279
influence the system by externalizing

1783
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,839
things through language and the

1784
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:14,640
different strategies that systems

1785
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,279
whatever scale they're on have

1786
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:19,799
minimizing prediction error

1787
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:22,140
um minimizing free energy but also I

1788
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,640
would just emphasize the importance of

1789
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,560
like external context here as well so

1790
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,179
even in the case of like a collective

1791
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:29,819
like a business you still have to take

1792
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:31,319
into account the environment in which

1793
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:33,479
the business is operating and I I've

1794
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:35,040
been really interested in a particularly

1795
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,439
extreme example of context

1796
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,198
um I used to do still do some work in

1797
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:42,479
philosophy of sport and I'd be really

1798
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,060
interested in dangerous sports and why

1799
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,819
there seems to be this insane contextual

1800
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:50,640
effect where within a very kind of

1801
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,279
narrow contextual band of sporting

1802
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,140
practice people seem willing to take on

1803
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:57,420
risks that outside of that context would

1804
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:59,820
just be completely insane

1805
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,920
um and I think this is something that's

1806
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,840
probably going to come up again again in

1807
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,600
uh you know subsequent weeks as well

1808
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,280
here when we talk about

1809
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,920
um the way that expectations on an

1810
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,260
individual or a collective basis can be

1811
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:18,840
set but through other Minds uh like

1812
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,840
patient so what somebody else expect

1813
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,920
myself to do and and so on and so on

1814
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,659
uh Darius you've had your hand up a

1815
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:30,000
while do you want to jump in yes please

1816
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,739
I'm not sure this is the sort of grand

1817
01:10:31,739 --> 01:10:35,400
synthesis of any of this but um

1818
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,800
hello was mentioned as I said that's the

1819
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,060
kind of

1820
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:39,840
um

1821
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,920
at topic of mine and something that we

1822
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,020
know about flow and this way it's

1823
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,400
integrated into this idea of language

1824
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,659
and agency

1825
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:50,960
is that at least in its original

1826
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,219
conception of success mahali and the

1827
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:54,360
sort of qualitative experience

1828
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,120
associated with flow you would find

1829
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,400
stuff like not only the dilation of time

1830
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,140
but also the reduction in

1831
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:02,520
self-consciousness

1832
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,800
and now this is sort of picking up a lot

1833
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,179
of work that happens at UCL and people

1834
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:09,000
like Jeremy Skipper how integrated

1835
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,400
languages into the sense of self

1836
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,280
and it seems to me and I you know this

1837
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,440
kind of shooting from the hip but all of

1838
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,800
these very deep-rooted I guess they're

1839
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,719
kind of psycho Technologies the self

1840
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:25,560
language seem to dissipate at this

1841
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,320
Goldilocks zone at this point of at the

1842
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,120
at this edge of criticality at this Flow

1843
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:30,960
State

1844
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,719
which makes me think if the flow state

1845
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:38,340
is a phenomenological offshoot of being

1846
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,080
or you know optimally reducing

1847
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,000
prediction error what is the kind of

1848
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,540
role of the concept of the self or

1849
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:48,179
linguistic functions because it seems to

1850
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:49,500
me that that becomes a regulatory

1851
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,600
function when that optimality is reduced

1852
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,179
when soft starts going wrong

1853
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:55,320
um so I think you can also think about

1854
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,880
this in the kind of hydrogarian or

1855
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,880
Dreyfus sense of just opening a door you

1856
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,440
only start to represent the door in

1857
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,659
yourself you only give it the linguistic

1858
01:12:03,659 --> 01:12:06,600
object of a door when you can't open it

1859
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,400
when you open the door

1860
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,320
standard there is no representation

1861
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,940
going there I mean you could even argue

1862
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,380
there's no quality out there so I'm

1863
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,420
wondering how deep that runs and what

1864
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,679
the kind of

1865
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:18,780
what we can say about the role of agency

1866
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:22,199
selfhood maybe even consciousness

1867
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:24,300
um because they don't seem to be that

1868
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,040
prevalent at least from my understanding

1869
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,980
when we are at the edge of criticality

1870
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,840
the the suggestion you're making there

1871
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:31,800
is um

1872
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,360
it sounds like what you're saying that

1873
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,500
these

1874
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,120
thing you call them psycho Technologies

1875
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,219
which I really like uh you know like

1876
01:12:38,219 --> 01:12:41,159
language and uh and and self-mod like

1877
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:42,900
certain aspects of self-modeling they

1878
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:46,020
are kind of scaffolding uh or like a

1879
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:48,480
ladder that you then kind of gets kicked

1880
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,000
away once you reach a certain kind of

1881
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,620
edge of criticality like where the

1882
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,580
performance becomes

1883
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,040
you're performing at such a level that

1884
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,540
you just don't need those those

1885
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:01,920
scaffoldings

1886
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,960
yeah or or

1887
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,620
the self-regulatory mechanisms that we

1888
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,920
harness when we're not in flow are

1889
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:14,280
linguistic or agentic in essence and

1890
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,620
once yes once you saw you you don't need

1891
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:19,739
that when you're at the sort of yes when

1892
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:22,260
you're at this edge of criticality

1893
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:25,620
um and I you know I only postulate that

1894
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,780
because I want I'm only I'm only

1895
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:31,739
thinking how deep does that go because I

1896
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:33,360
know obviously the the active inference

1897
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,219
framework is trying to tackle in some

1898
01:13:35,219 --> 01:13:37,080
ways the hard problem as well

1899
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,080
and there are some flotations of the

1900
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,460
idea at least within the flow Community

1901
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:44,699
about the kind of

1902
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:47,040
I don't want to say elimination but the

1903
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,460
moderation the modulation of qualia on

1904
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,980
the flow States so could that could we

1905
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:57,239
also consider that to be an a construct

1906
01:13:57,239 --> 01:13:59,040
um which happens when we're not

1907
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,800
necessarily

1908
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,659
optimally you know reducing prediction

1909
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:06,179
error yeah so a couple of things I so

1910
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:08,580
I'm certainly not the person to start

1911
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:11,640
talking about Consciousness so I won't

1912
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,980
um but I would just um

1913
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,020
I one of some of the readings that I

1914
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,880
mentioned in the lecture might be

1915
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,280
interesting for you on this topic so

1916
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,500
if we're talking about

1917
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,460
certain structures that seem

1918
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:29,600
very very pervasive in our phenomenology

1919
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,420
and how those structures can sometimes

1920
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:35,100
kind of dissolve away

1921
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,560
and how that might be accounted for

1922
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,659
under a active inference framework

1923
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:41,699
there's some really interesting work on

1924
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:44,520
psychedelics by George Dean and some of

1925
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,040
George Dean's co-conspirators I know I

1926
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,020
know Mark and Sam Wilkinson worked on a

1927
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,179
paper with George so George Dean's done

1928
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:53,520
some work on kind of ego dissolution and

1929
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,699
certain kinds of experiences

1930
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:58,500
related to selfhood

1931
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,780
um kind of and I

1932
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,340
kind of don't want to overstep the mark

1933
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,540
either but I think they kind of come

1934
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,219
they fall generally under this kind of

1935
01:15:05,219 --> 01:15:09,120
Rebus model of um psychedelic efficacy

1936
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,380
so I don't know if people are familiar

1937
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,179
with this but this kind of finds a

1938
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:13,679
natural articulation through predictive

1939
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:15,000
processing and hierarchical

1940
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,159
self-modeling and and that kind of stuff

1941
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:19,380
I also wanted to really quickly flag on

1942
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,840
this topic I'll find the paper and I'll

1943
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,760
put it up on the coder because I don't

1944
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:24,900
think I'll be able to find it quickly

1945
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,699
enough now but there was a paper that

1946
01:15:26,699 --> 01:15:28,860
came out very recently

1947
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:31,679
um that showed the efficacy of

1948
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,500
um internal self-talk on sports

1949
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,820
performance

1950
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:38,400
so there were so they did a they did an

1951
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,199
experiment with cyclists and they found

1952
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:43,560
that when you um when cyclists were

1953
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,080
allowed to engage in kind of constant

1954
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,820
self-talk with them so like in a

1955
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,679
monologue in their head their their

1956
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,420
performance at cycling was like

1957
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,820
measurably boosted which I thought was

1958
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,560
really interesting and kind of relevant

1959
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,540
here so but it's it's interesting

1960
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:00,320
because it kind of just kind of

1961
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:05,100
uh it sounds like it might primaphasia

1962
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,659
be in tension with what we were saying

1963
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:08,400
about flow States as well right so it's

1964
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,340
if if the real edge of performance is is

1965
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:12,780
a place where these structures are

1966
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:16,080
phenomenologic phenomenology bleed away

1967
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,940
um it kind of calls into question like

1968
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,040
to what extent are these psycho

1969
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,659
Technologies effective and in what way

1970
01:16:21,659 --> 01:16:23,460
are they effective and

1971
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,440
yeah there's like yeah just a whole kind

1972
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,940
of universe really interesting questions

1973
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,140
there

1974
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:31,440
so if I may uh sell food indirectly will

1975
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,020
be the the central topic of the last two

1976
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,100
sessions

1977
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:38,239
my position about it is that it's

1978
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:42,300
selfful in a sense we use all of the

1979
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,280
time

1980
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:47,159
is quite high level of construct that

1981
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:49,260
emerged from the ability we have to

1982
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,780
compare our activity to a

1983
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:54,120
socially embedded mother of our activity

1984
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,640
so that is something that is quite

1985
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,219
specific to humans because of their

1986
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:01,860
linguistic ability and or because of

1987
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:04,920
their tendency to um what tomasello

1988
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,780
calls the share intentionalities for the

1989
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,760
ability to collectively Define a neck

1990
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:09,739
plants

1991
01:17:09,739 --> 01:17:12,960
and so basically this is something that

1992
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,600
enables a very deep very um

1993
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,739
profound and robust transmission of

1994
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:20,820
cultural knowledge and transmission of

1995
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,679
norms this is what enables the

1996
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,179
Consortium of norms

1997
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:25,380
uh

1998
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:29,460
uh but it's quite heavy cognitively and

1999
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,800
it is predictable that if you're busy

2000
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,159
comparing what you do to what's another

2001
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,600
idealized version of yourself is doing

2002
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,239
you're gonna invest less Creative Energy

2003
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:40,800
in actually doing the thing that you

2004
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,020
would if you just you know did a thing

2005
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:45,719
so I'd say you have a pretty direct

2006
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:49,260
entitlement of the uh this flow thing

2007
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:52,640
from this model

2008
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:59,880
yeah yes this is my conclusion sorry

2009
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,100
um I think so we've run uh almost 30

2010
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,440
minutes over time and I know uh Mark's

2011
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,000
marks had to go and I'm gonna have to go

2012
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,480
very I think I pretty much have to go so

2013
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,800
um I just wondered if anybody has any

2014
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,960
final kind of quick questions or

2015
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,699
comments maybe we can move towards

2016
01:18:14,699 --> 01:18:17,299
wrapping it up

2017
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,820
um I'll I'll make a few comments but

2018
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,920
then you you're welcome to leave and

2019
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,780
other people welcome to stay

2020
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:27,000
um if they would like

2021
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,699
So yeah thank you

2022
01:18:29,699 --> 01:18:31,699
yeah yeah

2023
01:18:31,699 --> 01:18:35,219
well first um just on a

2024
01:18:35,219 --> 01:18:37,199
logistical note there was a little bit

2025
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:40,199
of lag so I'll encourage everyone who's

2026
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:42,320
listening as well as who's participating

2027
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,780
that we eventually plan to as with all

2028
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:46,980
of our live streams develop the

2029
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,840
transcript which will be curated and

2030
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,940
published and eventually not so far away

2031
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:53,040
in the future that'll be enabled with

2032
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,320
speech modeling to generate podcast

2033
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:58,380
quality audio so the future will be

2034
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,239
smooth we promise

2035
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:03,960
um but a few really interesting pieces

2036
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,360
that I that I picked out while I was

2037
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,060
embodying and listening

2038
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:11,400
um sir Regina you you opened the

2039
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,320
discussion with the disc with uh

2040
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:16,800
surprise and creativity and indeed it

2041
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,880
sounds like it's going to be attention

2042
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,460
how can a framework who's imperative is

2043
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,860
bounded surprise as opposed to say

2044
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,679
maximized reward how can a framework of

2045
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,480
his imperative is surprise minimization

2046
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,780
and bounding be used to generate novelty

2047
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:32,820
and I felt like people provided a lot of

2048
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:35,460
really cool answers and one other thing

2049
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,400
it reminds me of is uh Doug hofstetter's

2050
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:42,360
notion of spec fetishness I don't know

2051
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,000
how do you pronounce it but s p h e x i

2052
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,260
s h n e s s and it's the specs wasp and

2053
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,719
so he says well forget this whole

2054
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:53,820
creativity thing because when we talk

2055
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:55,320
about creativity it's like some sort of

2056
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,620
you know Pantheon like Divine status and

2057
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,900
abuses have to be uh you know called in

2058
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,640
and so then oh that's not real

2059
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,020
creativity and this isn't real

2060
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,699
creativity so instead he says well let's

2061
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:08,280
just focus on what would be the opposite

2062
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,980
and that would be the road procedural

2063
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,380
following even when there's an

2064
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,760
opportunity for what we would call

2065
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,100
creativity and then there's a Continuum

2066
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,960
so why does somebody paint that painting

2067
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,239
well why didn't they invent a new genre

2068
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:23,520
well why didn't they invent a new media

2069
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,820
and so all activity is existing within

2070
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,580
this continuum

2071
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:32,580
of creativeness which has many features

2072
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:35,280
such as generativity and productivity

2073
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,360
but also novelty but abounded novelty

2074
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,340
it's not creative to to knock the

2075
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,699
chessboard pieces off in a way that

2076
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:46,500
there might be an elegant chest move who

2077
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,300
only somebody in a certain cognitive

2078
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:51,780
setting could detect the Aesthetics of

2079
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:54,120
but I think that that was awesome

2080
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,880
um and then the second uh piece that

2081
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,120
really was was powerful was what

2082
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,960
Mark Mark's train the I guess the trains

2083
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,840
don't run on time where Mark is but but

2084
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,940
that's okay because he was able to

2085
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:10,620
rather than treat that as an

2086
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,900
undigestible surprise

2087
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,400
that was able to be basically

2088
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,820
cognitively metabolized into like an

2089
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,800
opportunity for friendship

2090
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,460
through language as a social medium

2091
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:26,460
and then he connected that to cognitive

2092
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:29,219
flexibility and coaching and then I

2093
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:31,920
thought about self-talk and our inner

2094
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,860
monologue inner voice

2095
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:37,739
and then there is that that was very um

2096
01:21:37,739 --> 01:21:40,020
provocative that like we aren't having

2097
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,420
self-talk potentially not even having a

2098
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:45,140
self in the flow

2099
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:48,060
manifolds the experience of a cell for

2100
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,280
the speech self self talk or again

2101
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,380
potentially even the total actual self

2102
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:56,159
as a technology and so then like

2103
01:21:56,159 --> 01:22:00,600
healthy self-talk would guide us

2104
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,820
to the flow

2105
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,980
and be kind of like a self-limiting

2106
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,480
technology

2107
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,580
because it would be like used in order

2108
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:11,280
to not be needed to be used

2109
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,500
which is kind of how we would hope

2110
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,560
Adaptive Technologies would be versus a

2111
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,360
maladaptive technology would be

2112
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,460
something that

2113
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:23,699
um entrenches its own utilization

2114
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:26,460
potentially at the expense of the

2115
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:28,800
functionality kind of like Doom

2116
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,260
scrolling status but that's internal

2117
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:32,760
rumination and those are the kinds of

2118
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,260
things that people have simulated in

2119
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,699
active inference

2120
01:22:35,699 --> 01:22:37,860
so those were some really cool

2121
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:41,100
pieces that was a great discussion

2122
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,080
could I just uh just just add something

2123
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,020
on the topic of creativity that I

2124
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,400
should have said earlier as well because

2125
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,800
I think it's really relevant to Regina's

2126
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,080
question and just the topic of

2127
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,880
creative and novel behaviors in general

2128
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,100
and the right of inference I think that

2129
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:57,960
whenever we talk about especially

2130
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,860
artistic creativity there's a tendency

2131
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:04,080
even even for people who are kind of

2132
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,080
well very very well burrowed into active

2133
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:10,080
inference and and activism and these

2134
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,520
kinds of Frameworks from cognitive

2135
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,080
science I think there's a tendency to

2136
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,239
think of creativity as as still like

2137
01:23:15,239 --> 01:23:17,520
it's almost like the last Bastion of

2138
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,120
internal cognitivist thinking like you

2139
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,739
you think creativity is something that

2140
01:23:22,739 --> 01:23:25,199
happens in here and bursts outwards and

2141
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,239
so how does that happen with this kind

2142
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:29,580
of whatever cognitive architecture we're

2143
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:32,219
positing but there's really very cool

2144
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:34,500
work by uh have to give a shout out to

2145
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,880
Mike wheeler

2146
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,219
um who has written some papers on the

2147
01:23:38,219 --> 01:23:41,820
extended mind and creativity and one

2148
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:43,440
thing that's not really come up very

2149
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,820
much that I didn't get time to talk

2150
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,440
about in the lecture is this really nice

2151
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,360
natural marriage between the extended

2152
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,340
mind and active inference um something

2153
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:52,080
that Andy Clark has been working on and

2154
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,179
I know he's gonna going to be doing a

2155
01:23:54,179 --> 01:23:56,520
lot more work on it but the claim

2156
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:59,400
wheeler makes and some others um

2157
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,800
I think Joanna zelinska has written and

2158
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,239
written a little bit about this as well

2159
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:05,580
is the fact that creativity itself is

2160
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:08,940
just as subject to kind of uh material

2161
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:11,460
in but the the the sculpting effects of

2162
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,679
material environments and socio-cultural

2163
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,260
environments as everything else is so

2164
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,540
create creativity is not this kind of

2165
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,820
romantic with a capital R kind of

2166
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:23,280
internal process that kind of bursts

2167
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,159
forth but it's creative thinking is just

2168
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:28,679
as much extended and embedded as

2169
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:30,060
everything else and there's some really

2170
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:33,239
great examples in in Mike Wheeler's

2171
01:24:33,239 --> 01:24:34,440
essay

2172
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,880
um I don't know is anybody familiar with

2173
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,620
the band Alt J

2174
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:39,960
there are British band they were kind of

2175
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,699
really big a few years ago they won the

2176
01:24:41,699 --> 01:24:43,620
Mercury music award because they have a

2177
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,900
super original sound

2178
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:49,080
so Alt J have this really quiet tinkling

2179
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,060
uh yeah they are a great band they're

2180
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:53,040
one of my favorites and they they have

2181
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,620
this really quiet pinky sound that

2182
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:57,719
everybody kind of assumed was just the

2183
01:24:57,719 --> 01:24:59,880
result of some kind of internal genius

2184
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,860
on the part of the band

2185
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:04,920
and as it turns out Alt J originally

2186
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,440
they they tried to rehearse as a as an

2187
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,960
indie rock band but they were confined

2188
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,600
to rehearsing in an apartment block and

2189
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,179
they kept getting noise complaints and

2190
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:17,219
so they ended up developing this quiet

2191
01:25:17,219 --> 01:25:19,380
tinkly sound because it was the only

2192
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,000
sounds they could rehearse that wouldn't

2193
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,760
get them kicked out of their apartment

2194
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,900
and I think this is a really beautiful

2195
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:27,120
example of how like even the most

2196
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,580
creative processes that seem on the face

2197
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:31,980
of it really creative are in fact

2198
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:34,560
just a subject to these external kind of

2199
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,020
this kind of agent environment system

2200
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:39,360
that underpins the whole framework so

2201
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,080
it's

2202
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,520
that's something that's going to apply

2203
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,980
to absolutely everything

2204
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:46,860
awesome and just the last question

2205
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:50,640
people are welcome to to drop off

2206
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,560
um the next section that we're heading

2207
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,080
into I'll be doing the lecture that's

2208
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,719
going to be in August and it's going to

2209
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:00,719
be on Collective Behavior so what would

2210
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:01,800
people

2211
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,820
like to learn or focus on about

2212
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:09,080
Collective Behavior

2213
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:20,760
anyone who hasn't um spoken or or it can

2214
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,820
just be a thought question

2215
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,800
but I haven't prepared the slides at all

2216
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,420
so

2217
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:31,100
I'm happy to take suggestions

2218
01:26:32,699 --> 01:26:34,980
yeah Darius and then anyone else

2219
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:37,860
I think what might be interesting is if

2220
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:40,080
we're saying that these uh systems are

2221
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,280
all in the business of producing

2222
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,280
prediction error of self-evidizing why

2223
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:48,120
do we see a diversity of

2224
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,880
um why do we see a diversity of social

2225
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,239
cultures of norms of

2226
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:58,020
um standards at a global scale why do we

2227
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:00,300
not just see some

2228
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:01,219
um

2229
01:27:01,219 --> 01:27:05,760
homogeneous way to reduce picture there

2230
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,280
which would manifest as a kind of

2231
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:10,860
singular culture which which is in the

2232
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:12,900
kind of business of self-eviducting that

2233
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,860
just kind of popped to my mind

2234
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,500
cool

2235
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,580
anyone else want to give a thought on

2236
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,080
Collective Behavior or on any other

2237
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:28,320
aspect otherwise it's been great

2238
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,060
I would like to make a comment of

2239
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:33,060
creativity

2240
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:37,320
so but uh does anyone like it's romantic

2241
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,940
if you want to make a comment on the

2242
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:43,099
next session I don't want to put that

2243
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:50,719
Ben said that creativity is

2244
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:54,300
intrinsically very hard to model because

2245
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:56,100
uh by definition

2246
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,620
uh creativity is something that brings

2247
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:01,260
about something new let us say

2248
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:04,679
and the mathematics we have to describe

2249
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:07,380
physics and life they are not very good

2250
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:08,960
at new things

2251
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,020
because the most basic tool you are the

2252
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:15,719
basic way to represent a system that

2253
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:19,440
literally everyone uses is a state space

2254
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,580
which is uh the list of all

2255
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:25,440
possibilities of a system

2256
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,780
if you say something is creative you're

2257
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,940
likely to think that it means it can

2258
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,219
bring about new possibilities and this

2259
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:34,320
intuition it conflicts directly

2260
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:37,139
with the very basic use of math to

2261
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:40,020
describe it so it is basically the same

2262
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:42,659
issues I was referring to earlier when I

2263
01:28:42,659 --> 01:28:44,100
talked about the comparison between

2264
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:47,639
active in France and an activist so

2265
01:28:47,639 --> 01:28:49,020
let's say uh

2266
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:51,659
activity biology inspired model of

2267
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:54,600
cognition and a core concept

2268
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,420
historically in those circles is

2269
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:58,679
autopoiesis so the ability of the living

2270
01:28:58,679 --> 01:29:01,679
to self-create literally this is Greek

2271
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,420
for self-creation

2272
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:06,060
and you are the a lot of drift and

2273
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,580
conceptualization and ambiguities that

2274
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:11,340
were resolved or not resolved and led to

2275
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:12,960
the crazies of frame of blah blah blah

2276
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,260
but today we talk of autonomy rather

2277
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:18,480
than autopoiesis and with the final

2278
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,360
autonomy as uh the property for a system

2279
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,120
of constraints over the activity of a

2280
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:28,199
system to reproduce genitals and because

2281
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:30,420
we're talking constraints

2282
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:33,120
uh just the ability to influence causary

2283
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,440
outcomes

2284
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:38,280
there is no really a prior that Dynamics

2285
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,020
in this space would be conservative so

2286
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:42,000
we have a possibility for constraints to

2287
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,800
you know bring about new things and

2288
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,440
reconfigure themselves and the notion of

2289
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,620
hydrogen she had used is based on that

2290
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:51,480
it's the ability to let's say

2291
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,920
reconfigure constraints in your

2292
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:53,880
environment

2293
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:57,300
and always the notion of creativity

2294
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,580
which would be likely a very close proxy

2295
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:02,639
to that but it's something that we do

2296
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:05,179
not know how to prevent

2297
01:30:05,179 --> 01:30:08,040
and most of the mathematics that exist

2298
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:11,100
are structurally enabled represents and

2299
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:14,400
so yeah that's a big one

2300
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,638
foreign

2301
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,540
Michael

2302
01:30:24,179 --> 01:30:28,199
uh I uh good to be here sorry I was late

2303
01:30:28,199 --> 01:30:31,440
uh what comes to mind for me at the

2304
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,719
collective you know I mentioned units of

2305
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:35,880
collective life what is it a wee is it a

2306
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,520
we Affair and uh you know but you know

2307
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,440
what what are the what are the units of

2308
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,179
we and any thoughts or insights about

2309
01:30:42,179 --> 01:30:46,199
that uh the the stages of the emergence

2310
01:30:46,199 --> 01:30:50,340
of formation into a collective uh from a

2311
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:53,940
me to a weed for example or um

2312
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:57,000
uh because I had a one that was on the

2313
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,920
tip of my tongue and it just escaped me

2314
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,540
oh

2315
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,940
um you know this idea of precision that

2316
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:05,100
um that I think it was Mark Miller was

2317
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,020
talking about or Matt

2318
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:11,420
um saying um you know uh

2319
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,520
at the uh

2320
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:21,900
if there's actions

2321
01:31:25,219 --> 01:31:28,500
what might be some of the most well

2322
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,860
understood limiting beliefs about when

2323
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,780
we use language of collected that keeps

2324
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:37,500
us repeating the same blind spots um uh

2325
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:40,199
and how might we say differently about

2326
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:43,199
Collective so that we we escape those

2327
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:45,719
predispositions

2328
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:49,159
make sense yeah

2329
01:31:49,159 --> 01:31:52,560

2332
01:31:58,860 --> 01:31:59,760
