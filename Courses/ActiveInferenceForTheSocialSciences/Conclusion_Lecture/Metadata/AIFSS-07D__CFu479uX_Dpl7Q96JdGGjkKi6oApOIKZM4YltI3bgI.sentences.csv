3930	4480	1	A	0.65241	You.
6530	7134	2	B	0.99993	Hello.
7252	8494	3	B	0.69342	Welcome, everybody.
8692	22026	4	B	0.74172	It's November 1, 2023, and we are in the closing discussion section for this first instance of active inference for the social sciences.
22218	23690	5	B	0.74211	It's been a journey.
23850	28720	6	B	0.99841	I'm sure we'll have many fun things to talk about and explore today.
29050	38760	7	B	0.98696	So Avil, please take it from here and maybe give an overview of what we're going to do and talk about today.
41210	48374	8	A	0.71518	Okay, so this is the conclusion session of our course on active inference for the social science.
48502	55770	9	A	0.99996	We have talked extensively about active inference, maybe less extensively about for the social science parts.
56110	65790	10	A	0.99817	So the goal of the session would be basically to assess what we talked about and how it is relevant or not to the practice of social sciences.
68070	72418	11	A	0.62262	Basically, this is a discussion session, so there is no clear plan.
72504	91998	12	A	0.99923	But I'd like to address how formally active inference accounts for agency and normativity and identity as a kind of integrated phenomenon, how it can compare or add to our ground or clash with, I don't know, sociological and political.
92034	96022	13	A	0.52551	Model of agency and of social evolution and of et cetera, et cetera.
96086	121058	14	A	0.99978	All the topics that we addressed, which are numerous and discuss about the plausible future for active inference, what it can be used to, maybe what it will be used to, certainly how it may change and how it's relevant to yes, that is the crux of it.
121224	131720	15	A	0.96427	We have brought in Alexey, who is a philosopher interested in social ontology, specifically the study of social kinds, which is from Kairos Research.
132250	136118	16	A	0.99	And I do not know who Colin is, but he's with us.
136204	137270	17	A	0.99768	Hi, Colleen.
139050	140706	18	A	0.99603	So how should we proceed?
140738	141590	19	A	0.7888	Danielle?
142270	143420	20	A	0.98543	What do we do?
144590	156140	21	B	0.99992	If you'd like, maybe pose a specific question or prompt, which could be preceded by a statement, and then we can all hear everyone's voice on that.
157710	169054	22	A	0.69694	Okay, so a good question would be ActInf inference describes agency and relativity and identity as a kind of integrated phenomenon.
169182	174340	23	A	1.0	I think we should go over how precisely it works.
178230	179574	24	A	0.55354	So, yes, let's do that.
179612	184930	25	A	1.0	I will find some, do you say, illustration?
185010	186274	26	A	0.99999	That will make it easier.
186402	189560	27	A	0.99905	But let's hear people's thoughts on that, please.
193180	196520	28	C	0.99237	Can you pose your question just a tad more clearly?
197020	203960	29	B	0.99967	How are agency, normativity and identity addressed separately and together in active inference?
209050	210600	30	B	0.8266	Mao, go for it.
212810	218402	31	C	0.82806	So I think we like to look at things in terms of interrelations.
218546	223658	32	C	0.99897	In active inference, nothing is defined by itself, it's defined in relation to other things.
223824	233020	33	C	1.0	And this definition in relation to other things also defines the types of constraints that will be pushed on the thing, which is separate from other things.
233970	244506	34	C	0.99988	Once you have this, you necessitate these interrelationships to be formative ontological and fundamentally contextual.
244618	251982	35	C	0.99987	So no relationship is perfectly reproducible across a different context.
252046	259010	36	C	0.99973	It will take on a hermeneutics or semantics, given the exact context of the spatial temporality of the entities.
260330	262354	37	C	0.50755	Those are some first thoughts.
262402	266760	38	C	0.99998	Does anybody have big objections to what I just said.
273100	273850	39	C	0.99947	Okay.
276320	277260	40	B	0.99632	Yeah, please continue.
277330	277852	41	B	0.99988	Sorry.
277986	279864	42	C	0.9997	Let's start with the concept of agency.
279912	284124	43	C	0.99997	For instance, agency is just action selection, right?
284162	286712	44	C	0.9998	So agents are modeled.
286776	293020	45	C	0.99998	They have a generative model and they use it to predict sensory inputs based on possible actions.
294640	300160	46	C	0.95642	They chatted, select those to minimize the difference between predicted and sensory inputs.
300740	302980	47	C	0.99989	So they're just trying to minimize free energy.
303050	308864	48	C	1.0	And this minimization is fundamentally due to the relationship of constraints in their environment.
308912	327736	49	C	0.99999	So let's imagine that I am an individual who sorry, I saw a comment and I didn't so yeah, so you have an individual that tries to exert control over the environment.
327848	341712	50	C	1.0	Now, if you scale this in nested structures, you can try to think of power structures and how agency within those power structures is modulated by the different kinds of constraints that are both embedded within the environment itself.
341766	357296	51	C	0.99991	Within the materiality of the environment and also within the normative aspects of the nested structures which pull and push an individual within certain paths through some kinds of deontic cues.
357328	373480	52	C	0.99982	So that's how you get to the notions of encoding agents beliefs and preferences about the world within the generative model through a form of normativity, which is just a higher precision over a specific type of outcome or mapping.
373820	385980	53	C	0.98141	So your prior beliefs here come from different layers in the hierarchy and these act as what we call culture or normativity.
386320	388272	54	C	1.0	I could stop here if you want to say something.
388326	407092	55	A	0.94135	Apple so I agree with what you said at a high level conceptual scale, but I think it's important to be clear about what formally governs the statement because what we are formally is much more limited than what we agree the interpretation could be.
407226	411460	56	A	0.98067	So can you see the screen I'm sharing?
412940	416484	57	A	0.97932	Can you see the mouse doing AIDS?
416612	417288	58	C	0.65147	Yeah.
417454	418168	59	A	0.68442	Okay.
418334	435612	60	A	0.9973	So at core, active inference is a framework that provides geometry for that is not a very straightforward way to put it, but what we have is a system with a space of state and we have a flow of the system.
435666	443216	61	A	0.84	A flow is a function that basically tells you where specific point goes with time.
443398	459008	62	A	1.0	And what active inference says is that given yes, given specific patterns of DEMICAL coupling and of statistical repurposes, we have agent like behavior.
459184	476190	63	A	0.99989	So the simplest kind of the basic requirement of active inference of the French principle, which is a core motivation for active inference, is that you have a limical system, so something with states and a flow and some noise because we need noise to get information.
476560	485550	64	A	0.99	And it has a boundary in the middle of it that statistically separates the external internal states.
485920	497968	65	A	0.99992	By statistically separate, I mean that every information about what's going on on there that is in there, it disappears when condition on there.
498054	502544	66	A	0.86093	So of information I have about this that I could read here, I can also read there.
502742	505216	67	A	1.0	And that's subtly different from the coupling.
505248	509748	68	A	0.99978	But this is formalism, let's not get too much into this.
509914	515112	69	A	0.54	And then you have more complex behavior when you can partition sensory inactive states.
515166	519480	70	A	1.0	And your particle, it can do things in this specific context.
521420	529836	71	A	0.99969	Basically we can write a geometry for the fluctuation of the system and this geometry entails belief over external states.
530018	550232	72	A	0.99989	So these internal states, it knows thing in a sense about what's going on out there through its coupling through sensory and active states and the flow it has internally, the way its internal states move, they entail a displacement of their belief.
550316	554976	73	A	0.72	And this displacement happens to be near optimal given Bayes constraints.
555008	556180	74	A	0.99963	Blah blah blah.
556520	571768	75	A	0.52	And the real interesting stuff happens in the case of strange particles, which are particles where as you can see, there is no direct effect from actions, active states to internal states.
571934	579548	76	A	1.0	The only action you have is mediated by sensory and external states, in this case the active states themselves.
579634	585230	77	A	0.65091	So the policy of an agent, it becomes the subject of beliefs of the agent.
585600	591052	78	A	0.83	And if it becomes the subject of beliefs, you can have statistical inference.
591116	594300	79	A	0.99776	This is the crux of this framework.
594460	601312	80	A	1.0	And if you can have statical inference, you can have like quite complex multilevel stall inference over reward actions.
601456	606288	81	A	1.0	And those are basically what we call decision taking or what we call planning.
606464	632236	82	A	0.99961	So what we have here is formal architecture that can derive the kind of complicated agency, semantic, not only agency, but agency that is embedded in a specific conceptual framework that is relative to this specific structure of an agent and their environment and the coupling in between.
632338	635672	83	A	0.99999	All that is traced back basically to dynamics.
635816	646960	84	A	0.99985	So we have a proof of existence that in a world that everything is dynamics, we can have agency, we can have complex decision making under the form of inference over one's own actions.
647780	656804	85	A	1.0	And then you have complications to apply it directly, of course, because the world is likely not in its barest form a limical system.
656842	665672	86	A	0.54813	It does not have a list of states that are okay, there is not a list of states that are possible and that's it.
665726	670232	87	A	1.0	And there is one coupling that takes those states to themselves and nothing can change ever.
670286	672410	88	A	0.98701	This is not likely to be the case.
673180	682556	89	A	0.9996	But we have a minimal model of agency that is purely physicalist, that is purely based on the causal relationship in the most minimal way we can possibly represent it.
682578	684030	90	A	1.0	And this is quite huge.
684560	694208	91	A	1.0	And this gives us a very strong prior over what is the stuff that agency is made of.
694294	702832	92	A	0.83	And the stuff that agency is made of, at least higher order agency that we think about here in the social context is belief over oneself.
702976	705936	93	A	0.97	And so to control actions is to control belief of oneself.
705968	724004	94	A	1.0	And this is this duality this dual aspect of statistical organization as a complex cognitive agent that is, in my opinion, at the moment, given the capabilities of modeling and formalism.
724052	748850	95	A	0.75675	We have the core contribution of active inference to social sciences written large psychology, neuroscience like sense of social stuff because it gives you very strong prior over what agency is made of and the kind of stuff that can exist out there in the social world and the kind of dynamics that bring about its stuff.
750440	761988	96	A	0.96272	But there is a quite big bridge to be made between the pure chemical system, formalism of active inference and the kind of topology evolution that happens out there.
762074	768650	97	A	1.0	And I do think there is high level of precaution to be taken when we talk about this kind of stuff.
769580	777960	98	A	1.0	And yes, does anyone want to react or agree or disagree violently?
778040	782380	99	A	1.0	Because I just attacked the common creeds.
786930	791714	100	C	0.81177	Not sure I perceived an attack perhaps from what I understood of what you said.
791752	800050	101	C	0.99998	Basically you have information geometry, it formalizes a belief space in a sort of geometric manifold.
801910	812822	102	C	1.0	The points represent possible belief systems that an agent can have and the distance between the points in the space can be interpreted as a measure of how different two belief systems are.
812956	831040	103	C	1.0	And this is necessarily tugged by the priors given by the environment which also push the agent to act in a certain way given the type of thing that it is, in order to maintain itself, given the actions that it knows it has available.
833010	844500	104	C	0.76	And this becomes normative because of the strength of the attractors within the belief space which become the geometric landscape, basically.
845590	854734	105	C	0.99991	So we can sort of model the attraction through the curvature of the space around the attractor.
854862	867100	106	C	0.67	And so a high curvature means a strong normative force which pulls the agent to adopt a certain, I like to say social scripts because that's what I've worked on but any sort of policy and or phenomenology norm.
867870	880430	107	C	1.0	And so in this context, the agent's agency is kind of complicated because it's both the ability to sort of navigate the landscape to move closer or further away from the attractors.
880770	905240	108	C	1.0	And so the degree to which an agent has agency is a degree to which it doesn't go necessarily directly towards the attractor, but has some degree of reflexivity over its own action space in order to navigate the different kinds of factors that may be available to it.
905610	920198	109	C	0.99968	So we could see that the momentum would be affected by personal experiences, education, innate tendencies or even the tendency to resist or yield to social pressures.
920294	922986	110	C	1.0	I could go on, but I know that a you have your hand up.
923008	924620	111	D	0.95733	So why don't you go?
927390	933166	112	D	0.35076	OK, I guess Avel could answer before I talk a bit.
933268	940030	113	D	0.99621	So I was just trying to have my hand raised before talking.
940100	946034	114	D	0.65063	So if Avel wants to answer you and afterwards I can talk, I'm OK.
946072	950260	115	A	1.0	I don't have anything specific to okay, okay.
951350	962470	116	D	0.99755	So you talked about the dual aspect of statistical organization of complex agents and you said that it was a core contribution of active influence to social sciences.
964250	980640	117	D	0.99998	Can you dig a bit on that and just articulate it a bit more so we could grasp it better and then I could ask questions.
982050	983760	118	A	0.99995	Do I still share my screen?
984130	984830	119	A	0.61284	Yes.
984980	998660	120	A	0.99973	So basically what we have in here is a formalism that deals from very basic dynamics like just web space and there is stuff that pensive space.
999110	1003540	121	A	1.0	Zero level physical representation of literally anything can go there.
1003850	1013682	122	A	0.99	And from there we build a model of first self organization, not quite that agentive self organization.
1013746	1020214	123	A	0.99997	Let us say something that can build a specific stable ecology and maintain itself in this ecology.
1020262	1021914	124	A	0.99999	That is what we have here.
1022112	1048798	125	A	1.0	And then given the lack of coupling between active and tone states, we can build sensitively, more complex stuff that can implement higher order beliefs about themselves and what they do and do decision making that is conditioned on information they have about themselves and qualification under the form of beliefs over their own action.
1048974	1053146	126	A	1.0	And as such, this is just math.
1053278	1060518	127	A	0.99805	This says nothing about the world in and of itself until we claim it corresponds to things in the world.
1060604	1072826	128	A	1.0	And we can claim that this is a basic conceptual model that maps well onto acculturation, basically socialization engagement with the cultural world.
1073008	1090646	129	A	1.0	Because then we can account of the human ability for very wide open ended learning as something that comes from there, as something that allows us to infer things about ourselves and then develop complex policies and neck them blah blah, blah.
1090778	1113650	130	A	1.0	And because to my knowledge there is no competing model that accounts for anything near that competition, I should not talk of competition, but the odd models of cognitive organization and culturation that exists that are trying to ground themselves in physics like an immigrant system.
1113720	1115410	131	A	0.99952	They are just talking about dynamics.
1115710	1120422	132	A	0.80873	They are specifically avoiding talking about anything like content or semantics.
1120566	1125930	133	A	0.95036	So they factor this piece of math as a monopoly on building semantics from the ground.
1126430	1131354	134	A	1.0	And what it tells you is that agency and identity and relativity is all the same phenomenon.
1131402	1136320	135	A	0.97983	It's conditioned by self belief basically that is constructed in this specific way.
1139170	1144690	136	A	0.91997	How to say because this is the only way that we can account for higher order agency.
1145350	1158470	137	A	0.99958	Then at least I would argue we should have a strong priors for a series of agency, either mechanical or conceptual that vibe well with that picture.
1158890	1160854	138	A	0.99943	So this is the claim I'm making.
1160972	1165240	139	A	0.98	I guess I went into too much detail, so I hope this is enough.
1166670	1173660	140	D	0.93071	Okay, so I have some, maybe not questions, but some points to make now.
1174030	1174940	141	D	0.99998	Thank you.
1176190	1191914	142	D	0.99957	So from what I see here, we could put the active inference paradigm into the individualistic methodological individualism framework in sociology.
1192042	1202578	143	D	0.99978	So the idea is that you try to model an individual and then when you have the good way to model the individual, you can generalize to what everyone is doing.
1202744	1219978	144	D	0.99993	So for instance, if I'm working on something in a certain way, then I could generalize about that and say, okay, sociologically I have this constraint to work on this stuff.
1220144	1225834	145	D	1.0	And then not like everyone is doing that, but it could go like that.
1225952	1237534	146	D	0.99956	But what is interesting here is that it's not only about one individual, but also that, for instance, let's take the external states.
1237732	1250898	147	D	0.99688	You could say that external states here are other agents, and also that, okay, so you have the active states and the internal states.
1250984	1256374	148	D	0.99991	So we could say that your internal states are totally influenced by another agent.
1256492	1261720	149	D	0.99994	So we could do something like that with two individuals, I guess.
1262090	1273820	150	D	0.99995	So one is one of the agent here and the other drives the internal states of the model because they are really influential on yourself.
1275550	1297522	151	D	0.55902	So there are some limitations about this kind of way of thinking because in general, in sociology or in sociological sciences, what you would like to say is that there are some agents at a higher level than only individuals such as you and I.
1297656	1309526	152	D	0.9995	So the trick could be to say that some states, for instance, or some firms are agents foreign by themselves.
1309708	1314310	153	D	0.99807	So you have agents which are not individuals or persons.
1318410	1336702	154	D	1.0	I don't understand what you're trying to say, Avel I was just trying to react to your slide because I don't see how it connects with my own work here yet.
1336756	1337962	155	D	0.99	Oh, I'm talking to Mao.
1338026	1339520	156	D	0.62891	Okay, nice.
1341410	1352820	157	D	0.50824	So yeah, if Mao, you have something to say about what I just said, about how we could have, let's say, two active agents trying to talk together?
1355850	1364226	158	C	0.99949	Yeah, we have such simulations that already exist over various kinds of scales.
1364258	1374026	159	C	0.99998	We have two agents coordinating that are animals like birds singing, and over time coordinating over the song they're going to sing.
1374208	1389070	160	C	0.99999	We have several models of leader follower, where you have two agents starting from relatively the same point, but one agent developing more confidence and therefore developing a dynamic of leader follower with the other agent.
1389140	1403300	161	C	0.99839	This is work that's possibly going to be followed by Francesco Balzan, who is working on models of education and how maybe the teacher and student dynamic may be cast under these terms.
1403610	1411650	162	C	0.6921	I've done work with Axel Constant and Maxwell Ramstead in terms of active inference in social scripts.
1411730	1413602	163	C	0.96754	That's what Ava was mentioning.
1413666	1426342	164	C	0.92	And this notion that through the cues of the environment, your own model is shaped both by the environment which includes other people, and the way in which you self evidence within this environment.
1426406	1431070	165	C	0.99993	So for instance, there's two ways we can understand your question.
1431140	1442974	166	C	1.0	First, we can say that minimizing free energy is basically an agent that has a form of autonomy and it's constantly updating its model to align with the environment.
1443022	1452530	167	C	0.99997	So by virtue of doing this, it's not fundamentally individual, but each agent has its own model of the world.
1452600	1464118	168	C	1.0	Each agent reflects a perspective, a very unique moment in spacetime that will incur some errors relative to others.
1464204	1472778	169	C	0.99999	So it's not that they necessarily interpreted things wrong, although they might have, but because their perspective is slightly off from somebody else.
1472864	1477020	170	C	0.92098	There's necessarily a degree of incommunicability in this sense.
1478030	1483386	171	C	0.99993	So here, self evidencing really entails that identity.
1483498	1493470	172	C	0.79964	You create a sort of identity here through the fact that you may have different preferred states from somebody else based on your values, belief, your social conditioning.
1493550	1499250	173	C	0.99999	But again, these beliefs and values and social conditioning have been shaped.
1500550	1504120	174	C	0.85444	Again, we're talking about these trove of attractors by other people.
1505530	1523180	175	C	1.0	And so we try more and more to challenge this notion of individualism by emphasizing the relational aspect of identity, which means that identity is not pre established but continuously formed through the interactions with other agents.
1523630	1543518	176	C	1.0	And again, if we go back to information geometry, the geometry of the information space influences how agents perceive their paths towards minimizing free energy and affect their choices, which again give you the possibility to understand how agents might be very strongly pushed by other agents.
1543684	1554758	177	C	0.99526	Let's imagine an agent that has more power than you and is trying to influence you to do something, someone that has very high charisma or someone who has the power to say destroy your life.
1554844	1566200	178	C	0.99956	You are more likely to shape your beliefs to align with, and therefore we can understand individualism under a very different light here.
1566730	1568540	179	C	0.11984	Avel, do you want to add something?
1569710	1572406	180	A	0.94541	Colleen is waiting to speak since moments.
1572438	1573226	181	A	0.94051	So let's hear.
1573248	1574010	182	E	0.7196	Colleen.
1578460	1581384	183	F	0.98577	Hi, can you hear?
1581422	1588924	184	F	0.49845	Okay, I just wanted to pick on a couple of things that Maha was talking about just now.
1588962	1607980	185	F	0.99	And in her talk it seems that you seem to be saying that for social conditioning and the way in which we are socialized, the importance of social scripts appears to be greater than the influence of individual upon individual.
1608150	1615328	186	F	1.0	And that's interesting because it's not something that we would tend to think as individuals that we are integrating with scripts.
1615504	1628120	187	F	0.99997	In fact, the whole idea of seeing a script as something which is social was something that I find that probably most people would find a rather strange idea off the top of our heads.
1631020	1633244	188	F	0.99999	Is that a fair assessment of what you're trying to say?
1633282	1647772	189	F	1.0	And the other thing I wanted to ask about was a few times in talks recently and here today, I've heard people talking about identity and the active inference view of identity.
1647916	1657830	190	F	0.92835	I'm not sure that I really understand what identity means within an active inference framework as distinct from just our internal model of who we are.
1658840	1665300	191	F	0.99998	Is there another idea that we're thinking of here?
1665450	1672036	192	F	0.59	And more particularly, the word identity has a lot of baggage and usage in current contemporary society.
1672228	1674232	193	F	0.99992	Are we using it in a different way?
1674366	1677272	194	F	1.0	And if so, how is it different?
1677406	1686190	195	F	1.0	And potentially, how does that give us insight and the ability to engage with the ongoing discussions in society in a potentially fruitful way.
1690840	1702824	196	C	0.95576	So I think I lost you for the last part of your question, which seemed to be about the difference between our conception of identity and the conception generally used.
1703022	1704170	197	C	0.99036	If that's correct.
1709740	1711400	198	A	0.75976	You'Re muted Colin.
1714750	1715162	199	F	0.96902	Sorry.
1715216	1720410	200	F	0.99948	Yeah, I was referring to the concept of identity as used in society.
1723230	1723642	201	C	0.99997	Right.
1723696	1735642	202	C	0.99499	So, I mean, I'm not going to speak to every use of the term identity because it's a very useful term that's used in law, that's used in physics, it's used in sociology and psychology.
1735706	1736960	203	C	0.99999	So it's used a lot.
1737810	1748066	204	C	0.99997	All I can do is explain roughly how we consider identity formation and then if you have a specific definition in mind for a specific field, we can maybe tackle that one.
1748088	1750980	205	C	0.9945	Does that sound okay?
1751530	1752278	206	F	0.90369	Yeah.
1752444	1757830	207	F	1.0	To be clear, I was thinking specifically about identity as determined by group membership in sociology.
1759930	1760680	208	C	0.57543	Okay.
1762490	1764918	209	C	0.99857	So I'm going to tackle social scripts first.
1765084	1773286	210	C	0.88596	Yeah, I'm going to tackle social scripts first and then I'm going to come back to identity because I think it fits plea.
1773318	1774490	211	C	0.99391	I've worked on that as well.
1774560	1786938	212	C	1.0	I know that Daniel and Avel have some work that relates to this as but so your first question was on the importance of social scripts and what it means for cognition, if I understood correctly.
1787114	1794990	213	C	0.99996	So from an internalist perspective, social scripts are cognitive structures.
1795150	1800382	214	C	0.99992	They guide behaviors, they're acting like brackets.
1800446	1802600	215	C	0.99991	We use the word constraints a lot.
1806090	1810498	216	C	0.79497	It's not a perfect guide because no semantic marker is a perfect guide.
1810594	1813394	217	C	0.99997	Everything is up for some degree of interpretation.
1813522	1824246	218	C	0.53275	It's just that there are some interpretations that are so strongly linked to some degree of embodiment that they sort of anchor the rest of our semantics.
1824358	1827246	219	C	0.99994	So, for instance, I can't stop breathing if I wanted to.
1827268	1828042	220	C	0.6	I can't.
1828186	1831614	221	C	0.52	I will stop, but eventually my body will restart on its own.
1831812	1845554	222	C	1.0	And so there's such kinds of natural laws here that create these bottom layer guidelines that can then be sort of derived to infer other things.
1845592	1858386	223	C	0.58	And social scripts are just representational, social extensions of these constraints given a historical context.
1858578	1862520	224	C	0.99358	So they model and.
1870090	1872230	225	A	0.99542	Did Mal drop or did I drop?
1873930	1875706	226	D	0.85	I guess it's they're given to you.
1875808	1880300	227	C	0.91739	Like somebody will actually tell you what to do and show it to you.
1880750	1882282	228	C	1.0	And sometimes they won't be.
1882336	1884146	229	C	0.9999	Sometimes they're just things you observe.
1884198	1889546	230	C	0.99998	Sometimes there's things you infer because you made a connection between a weak script and another weak script.
1889578	1896206	231	C	0.99998	So if you see something that resembles a chair in a room, you infer that, you have the affordance to sit on it.
1896228	1897654	232	C	0.99997	So that's a form of script.
1897722	1900974	233	C	0.87	And then you see other people doing the same and the script sort of cements.
1901102	1918520	234	C	1.0	And so now you associate this to another part of a sequence, and this becomes something that allows you to temporalize and basically leverage your B matrix in order to exist in the world in a way that doesn't cause friction with other people.
1918890	1920882	235	C	1.0	This also gives you action triggers.
1920946	1925610	236	C	0.99994	There are things you see in the world that now tell you this is the thing you should do now.
1925680	1931994	237	C	0.99987	So there's this sort of recursive loop that's very inactive, that pulls you in a direction.
1932042	1935658	238	C	0.99939	So the attractor isn't just a state, it's a path.
1935754	1937710	239	C	0.97	You're going to go down a path.
1938610	1941360	240	C	0.99756	So for now, does that answer the first question?
1943410	1943774	241	A	0.99994	Yes.
1943812	1944014	242	F	0.99932	Thanks.
1944052	1945010	243	F	0.42249	It's helpful.
1946070	1948820	244	C	0.99364	Okay, go ahead.
1949590	1950482	245	A	0.99998	Thank you.
1950616	1962710	246	A	1.0	To get back on the like, you talked about an active loop, and I think that's a critical thing to underline, which is that the engagement with the world is a cyclic process, a circular process.
1962780	1965590	247	A	0.9998	It construct its own conditions.
1969310	1981522	248	A	0.99347	There is no measure of power of structure versus power of agents because the structure is embedded in the agents and the agents are embedded in the structure.
1981686	1989150	249	A	0.99423	So I'd like to share my screen again to give some detail over what this entails.
1991490	1992554	250	A	0.97598	Good window.
1992682	2000130	251	A	0.99999	You should see a PDF with a tiny man personal montaigne and loops.
2001190	2003380	252	A	0.99971	Is it okay?
2004790	2005490	253	F	0.96649	Yes.
2005640	2006194	254	A	0.8	I see.
2006232	2006820	255	A	0.93898	Yes.
2007130	2018870	256	A	0.99768	So this is a presentation I did recently about the Unification Church, which is like when you want to be published, you say new religious movement, but you can say cult.
2018940	2031370	257	A	0.99263	It works, which originated, I think, in Japan and is now spread between Korea, Japan, and it says mostly we don't have numbers, but it seems to be the places where it's most implanted.
2031730	2057270	258	A	0.99	And it was very remarked because of the personality cult around the Reverend Moon, the founder, and the very overt exorcist practices of the cult, like asking you for the equivalent of ten years of salary at the time to take your ancestors from hell and put them in paradise by giving money to Reverend Moon specifically.
2058010	2088670	259	A	0.97	And they were the topic of very aggressive and excessive anticult movement in the they are becoming a bit noticed again by vice, not only vice, but notably vice, because you have very strange things like mass MAGA weddings with people waving rifle and that is very strange organization.
2089410	2096340	260	A	1.0	And at the time you had very moral panic, we say now, around the cult.
2097670	2111234	261	A	0.99203	You had basically a model of influence that was that evil people would brainwash you and then you were commanded by the cult and or Soviet secret agents from afar, and they could say to you, horse.
2111282	2115186	262	A	1.0	And this triggered homocydal mania in which you blah, blah, blah.
2115218	2127980	263	A	0.98494	So things that are unnaturalistic, I will say, and notably in reaction to the immoral panic, you had a movement biologists of religion that would try to understand how exactly the cult worked.
2128350	2137390	264	A	0.99	And the most famous sociologist to do that was Aileen Barker, if I remember, was she warned the money she was coming.
2137460	2146274	265	A	0.99973	So you can question her methodology, but she seems to have done the most thorough and well received analysis of them.
2146312	2152126	266	A	0.99497	So it's quite important thing and she questions that there is such a thing as brainwashing.
2152238	2169000	267	A	0.99945	There is construction of a specific social context that you have to comply to if you want to come, but they can force you, they do not have the capability to torture you and make you into RC radio community thing that does not work.
2169450	2180790	268	A	0.98	And so I forgot the name of the so David Frank Taylor explains the influence of the church in terms of choreography of total participation.
2180870	2191280	269	A	0.98919	So basically you have a very huge, very emotionally investing ritual that you just have to take part in to be a member of the community.
2191650	2203810	270	A	1.0	And if you are a member of your community, you will be helped, you will be loved, you will be supported, you will be constantly encouraged in a slightly coercive way to invest more of your time and money and whatever in the organization.
2204390	2211430	271	A	1.0	And if you don't, then all the support just leaves because you're a traitor.
2212730	2227660	272	A	0.99298	You have treason of the true parents who was kindly out of this own arts trying to save you like Jesus did, but better because Jesus failed by not having children.
2228190	2231420	273	A	0.9999	That is very dramatic thing to say and that is what they said.
2231730	2239390	274	A	0.28	And because of the way the organization is set up, you cannot possibly question that.
2239540	2241790	275	A	0.99972	Questioning is not accepted.
2242130	2245650	276	A	1.0	There is no private time in which you can privately question yourself.
2245720	2253442	277	A	0.82202	You are always engaged with people who are either formally or informally depending on your seniority watching you.
2253576	2273434	278	A	1.0	And so you have basically a context that makes it very easy to align with the cult values and it just happens that those values they entail self sacrifice for the organization but also for new members and total deference to the cult and its leadership and anything they tell you to do.
2273632	2282506	279	A	0.99049	So it's not kidnapping, but it's also not exactly free consent to a specific context.
2282698	2293498	280	A	0.99	And from a purely, I don't know what to say mechanical perspective they can make you agree when you are there, but they cannot make you go there.
2293684	2303662	281	A	0.99762	So a question is how precisely they can elicit compliance away from the direct context of the choreography of participation.
2303806	2311970	282	A	0.88	And there is like simple answer in my sense, which is that we have a coherent sense of identity.
2312130	2322058	283	A	0.99999	We can hardly think of ourselves as a good money 1 minute and then step out of the meeting and not think of ourselves as a good money.
2322144	2323514	284	A	0.99997	That doesn't make sense.
2323552	2324922	285	A	0.99665	Either we are or we are not.
2324976	2335760	286	A	1.0	At least most people tend to have one integrated sense of themselves as someone who is embedded in a specific social context and has specific norms and they are in such way.
2336370	2351570	287	A	1.0	And so the coherence of self identity, it provides a key coupling between your public and your private beliefs, what you are expected to do in social context and what you will effectively do and perceive the world as privately.
2351910	2361394	288	A	0.99	And this I would say in the example of the Munis, but in other rhetorical examples like the emergence of nationalism.
2361522	2382214	289	A	0.99887	It is a very straightforward confirmation that indeed coherence of self identity, like the coherence between what you do and what you think of yourself as doing, is a very important process in the structure of societies, generally speaking, at least contemporary societies.
2382342	2383978	290	A	0.99962	Maybe it was not the same before.
2384064	2390720	291	A	0.52	And so I do not think the context in which it's mobilized, of course it changes, but the mechanism, I don't think it's new.
2391250	2401102	292	A	0.98	And I'd like to get back on Alex's point that sorry, a's point that the approach we have is individualistic.
2401166	2413686	293	A	1.0	I do not think it is the case because if we are correct, there is a landscape of sociocultural affordencies constraints, things world out there and we engage with it.
2413708	2420902	294	A	1.0	And there are mechanism that makes this landscape not necessarily identical but very coherent between individuals.
2421046	2431426	295	A	1.0	And those mechanism are language and the material symbolism developing ritual, which is also symbolism, also meaningful, but maybe less than language.
2431478	2432400	296	A	1.0	I don't know.
2433010	2464306	297	A	0.53	I just mean that the mechanism is the same and the interculturally robust practice of role taking and shared essentialities of trying to do stuff together given a specific model of the attribution of tasks within the shared goal and so these are human invariants and all would be pretty good candidate to force the integration of a common model of material and cultural niche.
2464498	2487674	298	A	0.66	And so I think that there is a pretty coherent, social material niche, and I think that we all engage with it and we all modify it, and we maybe do not perceive it as the same, but there is still a strong enough constraints on the coherence of this landscape between individuals for it to make sense as a specific entity.
2487802	2498142	299	A	0.98	And then the proper explanatory scale of what we do is not the individual minds, it is landscape that we happen to experience because of our individual minds.
2498286	2512022	300	A	0.99327	So by the plateau academia of Stanford on Holism basically Holism is a theory where you agree that there are explanations that are not mediated by individual states.
2512156	2516502	301	A	1.0	And I say there are explanation that are not inherited by individual states.
2516636	2527180	302	A	1.0	And not only that, but I can point to organization that control people while being absolutely not worried about individual states only creating a circumstance and then allowing them to engage with it.
2527550	2540830	303	A	0.99	And that would be compelling, in my opinion, to say that the model we have is maybe not Holist, maybe a secret third thing that is multiscale but certainly not individualist, at least in the sense that you are mobilizing.
2541650	2542640	304	A	0.9975	Thank you.
2543010	2544882	305	A	1.0	I talked more than I wanted.
2545016	2549060	306	A	0.83076	So Mao, you were raising your hands.
2549510	2551474	307	C	0.94	I am, but I think Lorena wants to go.
2551512	2553250	308	C	1.0	I will go after Lorena.
2555750	2556760	309	E	0.99775	Hey, guys.
2557290	2567350	310	E	0.99932	Yeah, I think that goes directly into the idea that coming back a little bit to the point that identity they were talking before.
2567500	2582662	311	E	1.0	And if you think about the model that we have, we have the external states and different agents, they are always actually very local and situated in the same local constraint local environment.
2582726	2583002	312	E	0.99953	Right.
2583056	2591482	313	E	0.99991	So your external agent is going to be part other agents are going to be part of your external states and you are part of theirs.
2591546	2592014	314	D	0.99986	Right.
2592132	2611782	315	E	0.99999	So the idea of laying down a path and creating a specific type of dynamic that react to the same type of input that you are receiving and driving this dynamic will generate this sort of embeddedness right.
2611836	2615480	316	E	0.9994	Because you do have the same.
2617690	2618054	317	D	0.89	Or.
2618092	2622086	318	E	0.83948	No, it's not necessarily the same, but they're very close to each other, they're very approximate.
2622118	2622410	319	E	0.79664	Right.
2622480	2637338	320	E	0.99824	So the idea of a dynamic here, if you think about describing that in terms of like, in terms of the dynamics, you do have very different Lawrence butterflies, for instance.
2637434	2640058	321	E	0.99996	Each one goes through the same type of route.
2640234	2642830	322	E	0.99971	However, they're not identical, but they are very similar.
2642980	2651998	323	E	0.56598	They are doing something very similar and that similarity sort of constrains, again the construction of that environment.
2652094	2662258	324	E	0.99998	So if you think about symbols and roles and types of environment that you find, they're going to be as concrete as something else that you find in your environment.
2662354	2680422	325	E	0.70124	Constraining and pushing you towards the same direction or at least a very similar you can describe dynamically in a very similar type of geometry if you like, or this attractor will drive the very similar type of path.
2680486	2687618	326	E	0.79278	Will describe this similar type of path which goes exactly to the Avel.
2687654	2689120	327	E	0.99932	Can you go back to that?
2693410	2700740	328	E	0.89	The other figure that you have, the one with the environment as well made by yeah, that one.
2701110	2703218	329	E	0.54773	So exactly.
2703304	2718520	330	E	0.99996	That creates a dynamic that they can be then forgotten in a way that will be described through a specific mark of blank that will develop agents together.
2718910	2734270	331	E	0.51934	We push them constraining, they're going to be constrained together and they're going to have a constructive kind of role in this very embedded normativity.
2735650	2736960	332	E	0.92519	But yeah, you go.
2738770	2739520	333	C	0.99989	Thanks.
2740210	2740574	334	C	0.9528	Yeah.
2740612	2748254	335	C	0.99988	So I think there's a nice way to tie all this as well to the internal nature that we seem to be dispelling, but we're not.
2748372	2753262	336	C	1.0	We have to talk about specifically in what ways internality is cast here.
2753396	2759094	337	C	0.99	And I like to think of the effect of self esteem here.
2759212	2777818	338	C	0.99999	Self esteem to me is the degree of fitness relative to your perception of how well you're managing to exist within these constraints and interpret them in a way that gets other people to validate and minimize the friction that you're getting from other people.
2777904	2782634	339	C	0.99304	So it aligns with the concept of sociometer theory.
2782682	2785310	340	C	0.67359	It taps into this notion of cultness.
2786450	2812470	341	C	0.99985	So if you consider that there's effective states that enable an individual to track and respond to discrepancies between self perception and social expectation through these effective states such as anxiety or positive affect, we can see that there's a dynamic nature and self organization of self esteem which is continually shaped and reshaped by experiences and interactions.
2813690	2816226	342	C	1.0	And so under active inference.
2816258	2830970	343	C	0.99999	We can formalize this by saying that a model that is more precise effectively captures the hierarchical structure of the moment to moment variation of more stable traits, such as what we consider to be selfish.
2832530	2846606	344	C	0.97	And so basically we can see that identity and group membership here are fundamentally related to the effective experience of being fit for the group membership.
2846718	2855940	345	C	1.0	And so once you're there, you can grow in social cohesion and this will lead you to potentially try to maintain the group.
2856390	2874858	346	C	0.99993	It will lead you to try to justify the beliefs of the group such that you have a form of confirmation bias, but also you maintain the epistemic reality of this group, the symbolic reality of this group, which would be more costly to destroy than to actually support.
2874944	2878086	347	C	0.99968	It's also integrated into your self esteem.
2878118	2886720	348	C	0.99999	Therefore, destroying the group would mean admitting that you are potentially not fit for the environment, that you are potentially some degree of wrong.
2887810	2894974	349	C	1.0	And so this leads us to the possibility that if someone has low self esteem, what do they do?
2895092	2906222	350	C	1.0	They can either stay in this group and accept that they are unfit for the group, and they would try to remove themselves to some extent from the group to avoid all that friction.
2906366	2918422	351	C	1.0	Or they can try to join a different group, one which will support your beliefs about the world if your beliefs are too far from where the group you're supposed to belong to currently is.
2918476	2929562	352	C	1.0	And this is where we get to these subclusters forming these little subgroups that potentially can even become sometimes violent and sometimes really not.
2929616	2942400	353	C	0.99999	Sometimes it's just some tumblr group, but it has power because it gives the individual this feeling, this valence of now being fit to a group that supports their model.
2955610	2959720	354	C	0.95712	So I wanted to give a space to talk.
2960970	2962360	355	D	0.99886	Yes, thank you.
2963690	2972310	356	D	0.99645	So I would like to go back a bit on what I said about individualism.
2972470	3005558	357	D	0.99822	So, yeah, I agree that I was wrong about associating active inference with individualism, because what is interesting here is that there is an individuality through active inference which emerge from the collective, and you can justify or describe individual actions, or else through the landscape, as you did just now, and then go the other way around.
3005644	3017820	358	D	0.99802	So here we seem to grasp the interaction between the individual and the group and vice versa, which is what I found interesting here.
3021390	3022186	359	D	0.64624	Okay.
3022368	3028480	360	D	0.98485	Moreover, there is what the individual adds to a group.
3030130	3031390	361	D	0.69	I see that here.
3031460	3041034	362	D	0.99995	It seems to be captured as we take the individual as how to say that a unique perspective.
3041162	3050660	363	D	0.99997	This is what you said before now, that each person is a perspective, a unique one.
3051030	3055458	364	D	0.9	And yeah, it's not all what I wanted to say.
3055544	3066262	365	D	0.82607	Also, Lorena, you talked about the beliefs that exist, and I think this is one interesting thing also in active inference.
3066326	3092726	366	D	0.91306	It's that we take belief as a material thing that influences us and that we can also influence or create in a way even independently of if it's right, wrong or whatever we judge it is like what we talked about with the Moon sect and the Unification Church.
3092858	3101598	367	D	0.57465	So there are people with crowns and we say that they are the big boss and we have to deal with it or to go away from the landscape.
3101774	3102930	368	D	0.99914	From the landscape.
3103010	3118074	369	D	0.99	And yeah, it was like that in the social world, indifferently of if the person is really like the chief of the cults or not because they said they were and people were just following them.
3118112	3132320	370	D	0.99989	So in the end it happened to create a landscape in which one person is the person who has power.
3134290	3136590	371	D	1.0	I don't know what to say more about all of this.
3136660	3145070	372	D	0.74	I guess I agree with what you said just before, that's it.
3154830	3161290	373	A	0.99951	So maybe we should move to challenges and opportunities of active inference.
3163490	3171054	374	A	0.99681	So two points, I think I just put them out there.
3171092	3172270	375	A	0.9996	You can react.
3173750	3191240	376	A	1.0	I think that one ActInf inference may give us computational models or even thorough grounded conceptual models of social organization, specifically the semantic dimension to social life.
3191930	3212000	377	A	1.0	And I also think that in its current formulation, within the Mikhail system theory, it is inept to represent parent evolution because Mikhail system entail the formulation of a set of states that do not change through time and a mikol flow that does not either change flu time.
3212450	3226378	378	A	0.99991	So there are opportunities to apply the model to the framework to grounded, meaningful, semantically complete models of revolution.
3226554	3240440	379	A	0.99996	But this model, if they are conformed evolution, they will not really vibe well with the math that we invoke to say our computational model are meaningful and that's like rise and array of questions, I guess.
3240970	3245350	380	A	0.92597	So does anyone want to react to these two statements?
3273980	3277880	381	F	0.54217	Could I go sorry, could I make a comment?
3280780	3291564	382	F	1.0	More specifically, I'm interested in the ways in which the ideas of active inference impact on the way we think about society and the way society works.
3291762	3304080	383	F	0.76	And I can see from my reading and from listening to the discussion that there's a very rich due lexicon in vocabulary set of concepts for the thinking within active inference thought.
3304150	3307836	384	F	1.0	And as we just commented, it's quite heavily mathematical.
3307868	3325156	385	F	0.99998	So the barrier to entry for the full active inference worldview, over time these ideas will permeate out into the mainstream and they will change the way people think and talk about society.
3325348	3342664	386	F	0.99288	I'm interested in the ways people who've studied a bit more than I have see potentially how this will change the way society works or the way that we have discussions or envisage society more widely than just an academic discussion.
3342712	3356270	387	F	0.99846	Obviously, maybe the questions are a bit too big.
3358560	3361452	388	A	0.73	I think everyone is just waiting for the other to talk first.
3361506	3363150	389	A	0.64956	Mao talked first.
3365680	3382704	390	C	0.52866	So I think I want to tackle a little bit what you said about the open ended nature, the open ended evolution in of state spaces.
3382752	3393240	391	C	0.99996	Basically, I think under the path formulation, this open endedness is actually just a perceived open endedness.
3393580	3402440	392	C	0.99743	It's just a function of the timescale being considered and the motion along that timescale.
3405840	3409390	393	C	0.99	I think we can go a little bit more into depth about this.
3411040	3413260	394	C	1.0	I think it's a very large topic.
3413600	3423452	395	C	0.99983	Effectively, if we go into quantum formulations, there's some degree of irreducibility, and anything above that is historically contingent.
3423516	3430064	396	C	0.70481	So obviously some Markov blankets will dissolve and reform and dissolve and reform.
3430112	3437220	397	C	1.0	And through this dissolution and reformation, you get a new potential for mapping of observation to states.
3437290	3439700	398	C	0.99995	So there's always that possibility.
3441420	3454360	399	C	0.99322	But I think some challenges for active inference that are coming is, for instance, the complexity of social behavior.
3458160	3463340	400	C	1.0	We can extend active inference to capture the nuances of social interactions.
3463920	3468492	401	C	0.99999	But effectively, active inference is about abductions.
3468556	3471250	402	C	0.99998	So it's the best guess for now.
3472260	3483780	403	C	0.69	And it requires for us to put into the models what we think are useful variables, what we think are the right variables.
3484200	3491430	404	C	1.0	And it's possible that we're always going to fall just a little bit short.
3492440	3502392	405	C	0.99999	We can either throw a bunch of data at a problem and be like, well, okay, well, just remove the noise, only pick up the signal, and figure out what's happening.
3502446	3505388	406	C	0.99998	But that's no better than big data and deep learning.
3505474	3516616	407	C	0.99969	So we have to figure out a way to move forward and understand the variables of interest and do this across scales.
3516728	3530112	408	C	0.99996	So identify the priors that take over at a given moment, but they won't take over even if they're higher in the hierarchy at another moment, because in this hierarchy, you've actually switched states like you've moved.
3530256	3535456	409	C	0.98	And this is only predictable once you've understood the effect of those priors.
3535648	3539430	410	C	0.88	And you can't just consider that you have the priors to begin with.
3541660	3549992	411	C	0.97618	So, yeah, as far as integration with existing theories, I think we have a nice opportunity ahead of us.
3550126	3553396	412	C	0.99572	It's basically what you said, Colin.
3553508	3571564	413	C	1.0	I think we're going to be able to more and more, through the alignment of certain kinds of language and the formalism under that language, we're going to be able to pull more and more theories and find what's at the core of the connection between these theories.
3571692	3586900	414	C	0.99931	Active inference is supposed to be scale free, so it describes or it is possible to help us describe the phenomena basically from sociology and literature to biology.
3587400	3610700	415	C	0.92819	So if we understand this, we understand that there's a possible touch point, a convergence of all these fields that are tapping into the same ideas or into some connecting points that allow us to understand how we maybe do away with these different fields, remove the silos, and come back together with something that feels more integrative.
3612080	3615020	416	C	0.99992	But then again, we're back to the computational limits, obviously.
3615090	3632192	417	C	0.98095	Like, if I want to compute the prediction for an entire country, what is the granularity level at which I should compute the right variables and if we understand that individuals are formed by the group, et cetera, do I just do a mean field over the entire group?
3632246	3637380	418	C	1.0	In which case am I losing out on some of the variables that may actually impact the outcomes?
3637720	3642200	419	C	1.0	I think these are the key questions that remain to be answered to some extent.
3647480	3650292	420	A	0.99983	So I agree with what you said.
3650346	3650950	421	D	0.68	Now.
3653960	3664708	422	A	1.0	I agree that we can't represent things and not somehow not cut anything relevant to the thing when we model or we represent.
3664884	3672988	423	A	1.0	The point of it is to have a more compressed way to engage with the thing, with our knowledge of the thing, than the actual thing.
3673074	3675070	424	A	0.99998	So we will just cut information.
3675680	3679128	425	A	0.99999	That is the point of modeling or representing.
3679304	3691024	426	A	1.0	And maybe in a very simple system such like just say perfect gas model in physics, there is information we can cut and lose nothing.
3691142	3701312	427	A	0.99973	We can cut information about which particle is where, because the different particles of the same atom as at this scale, the same properties.
3701376	3705636	428	A	0.99999	So we don't really care what atom does what.
3705738	3715064	429	A	0.99881	But in the case of human societies, we have patterns of engagement and the specific information that is accessed by a specific agent is important.
3715262	3720270	430	A	1.0	And whatever we choose to cut for a model, it will be relevant at some point.
3720640	3731790	431	A	1.0	At least it will probably be if the information we cut is not specific to a bunch of agent that will die of car accidents or something.
3732480	3738336	432	A	0.99981	If any kind of information, any type of information we may want to abstract out will be relevant somewhere at some point.
3738438	3741644	433	A	0.96425	So yeah, we are dealing with complex systems.
3741692	3743616	434	A	0.99971	We are not going to model everything.
3743798	3771900	435	A	0.98305	But it is a huge deal that active inference is capable to fill in the semantic content from dynamics, either from the dynamics of component systems, say neural dynamics and biological dynamics, or dynamics of a social context with the modeling of axe inference agent as things that navigate the world and make inference and stuff.
3772050	3779900	436	A	1.0	And to my knowledge, we do not have any other theory that makes the bridge between just dynamics and semantics.
3780560	3792364	437	A	0.99999	We have other neurological cognitive neuroscience people who talk about dynamics a lot and how we can bring back the activity of cognitive systems to dynamics.
3792412	3798672	438	A	0.99998	But usually it is in a way that insists that we should just look at the dynamics.
3798736	3806788	439	A	0.99998	We don't really need to worry about the semantics or if we need to worry about the semantics, they somehow reduce to the dynamics.
3806884	3810970	440	A	0.79	The dynamics is what exists and is important and what we should worry about.
3811660	3835984	441	A	0.66	And so another framework that is relevant to just study evolution of norms or presentation or mental content in a context, I cannot think of one, one that is thoroughly grounded at least that attempts to thoroughly ground itself in mathematics, mathematical physics, there isn't another one.
3836182	3838192	442	A	1.0	And so that is a huge deal.
3838326	3856210	443	A	0.98698	But there is a very important problem, which is what I said and you said, and we're grown, which is that the periness in the path integral formulation, in earlier formulation in the FEP, it is illusory, it is about like it.
3856540	3863764	444	A	0.97545	So maybe to give a bit of context, the path integral formulation of the FEP is just when you do the FEP.
3863812	3883180	445	A	0.99623	So the bit of math we make a huge deal about and we apply it not to the dynamics of a particle per se, like how it affects the particle at point T, but how it affects pathes of a particle for mathematic reasons.
3883340	3887152	446	A	0.81143	Reframing a problem in path integral formulation is a huge deal.
3887286	3892476	447	A	0.77236	It is what makes the difference between a Newtonian, you push something and it moves.
3892588	3898080	448	A	1.0	And full fledged quantum gorge theories that underwrite all of contemporary physics.
3898820	3902996	449	A	0.97385	So yes, path integral formulation is a huge deal.
3903098	3908890	450	A	0.99936	But to write it, you still need to write an emulator space, like to make the list of all things that are possible.
3909500	3930684	451	A	0.99	And if you think that this is a correct model of the world and a complete model of the world, and this is everything there is, you have to agree either that cause do not exist or that there is a place in the primoldo wave function that existed before universe did, before time did.
3930802	3939164	452	A	0.99993	There is a place where cones lies and I think cause exists and I do not think cause are basic properties of quantum mechanics.
3939292	3942284	453	A	0.99805	So cos must have happened along the way somehow.
3942412	3945120	454	A	0.99	And to represent that mean to represent open endedness.
3945620	3950176	455	A	0.8428	So we need open endedness in math and the FEP is not one ended.
3950208	3954656	456	A	0.77	And structurally it's very hard to account for open ended evolution.
3954848	3968756	457	A	0.83	And at a more prosaic level, when we look at engagement with social dynamics, with the social world, we look at open endedness because there is always integration of norms, there is always a loss of information, but also that is constructive of new norms.
3968868	3971452	458	A	0.99433	There is no, like, writing happen at some point.
3971506	3983260	459	A	1.0	And then we did things differently, changed the structure of cities, it enabled administration to exist as a non trivial power society that actually mattered its organization.
3983700	3986176	460	A	0.65	And yeah, so new things happen.
3986278	3992016	461	A	0.84	And if we want to look at social engagement, it is critical to look at how new things happen.
3992118	3994980	462	A	0.99	And currently the FEP doesn't do that in active inference.
3995480	3997108	463	A	1.0	I don't think it does that.
3997274	4002208	464	A	0.89165	Maybe it can at a computational level without grand from all pretension.
4002304	4004452	465	A	0.76507	Maybe, but I did not see it.
4004506	4008136	466	A	1.0	And that's a big challenge that we have ahead of us.
4008238	4013290	467	A	1.0	And by we I mean everyone, not just ActInf in front of people, everyone should tackle that at some point.
4020350	4022654	468	A	0.36169	Daniel, you were raising your hand.
4022852	4026000	469	B	0.99713	I'll add just a few notes to Colin's question.
4026530	4035586	470	B	0.99991	Certainly it's something that we all ask ourselves and many viewers and participants in the ecosystem ask like, so what then?
4035768	4044062	471	B	0.99999	What does it really mean for active inference to be applied to or by or in the social sciences.
4044126	4062342	472	B	0.99941	So I think that's a big open question, certainly one that's not only addressable by one perspective or even with words alone, but I think there's a few key pieces especially that differentiate it from just the broader or adjacent project of quantitative social science or formal social science.
4062486	4067260	473	B	1.0	The question we should seek after is what does active inference bring in?
4067630	4080638	474	B	0.99	And again, probably many ways to say it, but we know for an active inference agent, as a scale free statement, free energy can be bounded by changing the world or changing the mind.
4080724	4098674	475	B	0.99989	So having continuity of social systems with all other systems, spatial, temporal, arbitrary, material and so on, gives a continuity and an interoperability that without a scale free first principles approach, is essentially not even on the radar.
4098722	4100422	476	B	0.99997	So that's one massive piece.
4100556	4112806	477	B	1.0	And then I think where that begins to bear or modify fruit is essentially the scientific and professional development of cognitive engineering.
4112998	4128538	478	B	0.99997	Understanding that the cognitive constraints and scaffolds scripts, all of these tasks implicitly and then more recently, explicitly and most recently quantitatively, informally, are examples of cognitive engineering.
4128634	4151330	479	B	0.99997	So whether it's a stop sign and what that comes to mean in different social locations or language as a complex phenomena, these are examples of cognitive engineering in the same way that building a stack of rocks is both an example of material engineering and cognitive engineering through semiotics.
4151490	4170518	480	B	1.0	And now when the scientific process, the professional process, enters into this reflexive and relational posture through active inference, that is kind of a saddle point into a different dynamic, I believe.
4170624	4171630	481	B	0.79565	Lorena.
4179900	4182090	482	B	0.96557	Lorena unmute and then go for it.
4183740	4187512	483	E	0.98009	Yeah, I just make one comment upon what is that?
4187646	4205568	484	E	0.99985	Keep in mind that active inference can understand beliefs and signs and this kind of semiotics as material and concrete because constraints, they constrain the evolution of the system, like how the system complexifies, right.
4205654	4211760	485	E	1.0	And the constraints has this material effect on the dynamics.
4212100	4215408	486	E	0.99997	You cannot really believe that.
4215494	4218720	487	E	1.0	Of course belief is materialized as a table.
4218800	4219588	488	E	0.94	Of course not.
4219674	4229280	489	E	0.99826	But for the system in terms of constraining and understanding how things scale up and how they complexify, they have that kind of role.
4229440	4249900	490	E	0.99	And that helps to understand a little bit what Velvet was bringing about how you can bring new values and parameters for the dynamics that are being described by the mathematics of external and internal free energy principle updating.
4250480	4260576	491	E	1.0	And that is a way of tackling this novelty for this kind of thinking over time.
4260598	4270470	492	E	0.99133	But you don't have a proper account on how to predict what is going to constrain the system next.
4271160	4271910	493	E	0.84751	Right?
4277650	4278110	494	B	0.66069	Yeah.
4278180	4279406	495	B	0.52048	Mao, go for it.
4279428	4283730	496	B	0.75	And then we'll all kind of give a closing round.
4284070	4285010	497	B	0.74225	Thoughts?
4287030	4292180	498	C	0.99813	Okay, well, there was a question in the chat at one point.
4292650	4296600	499	C	0.65	I just wanted to potentially address the question if that's okay.
4298570	4311530	500	C	0.99879	So the question was, so would the generative process of modeling the social system enclose multiple agents on one Markov blanket or I assume inside or under one Markov blanket.
4311870	4316934	501	C	0.8042	So we like to think of active inference as nested in hierarchical.
4317062	4332226	502	C	0.5821	That's one thing that Maxwell Ramstead definitely pioneered, where each agent has its own mark of blankets, but there is a higher level Markov blanket that encloses the social system in play.
4332408	4342826	503	C	0.99995	So individual agents can interact with each other and the environment, but the social system as a whole also interacts with the broader environment.
4342958	4357494	504	C	1.0	And this is where semantics and semiotics come into play and the narratives around certain groups start shaping how they can interact with the other groups which have a perception of these narratives.
4357542	4360410	505	C	0.88891	So there's in group and out group dynamics.
4362510	4371550	506	C	0.9969	So it's a little bit akin to how cells within an organism have their own boundaries but are also part of a larger organism.
4373970	4378910	507	C	0.99462	So, yeah, I think that does that answer the question from the person who asked?
4378980	4379600	508	C	0.99854	That.
4382930	4383546	509	B	0.49125	Does.
4383668	4384340	510	B	0.99841	Nice.
4385030	4395750	511	B	0.97904	So perhaps A and Colin, feel free to give in your marks and then we'll pass around the instructors.
4399310	4402314	512	B	0.99887	It can be as long or as short as you like.
4402512	4402922	513	D	0.98432	Okay.
4402976	4404940	514	D	0.68	May I go first?
4405550	4429938	515	D	0.92957	So I would like to say that the key issue we are trying to grasp is that effective in France has social and political implications due to its scale free structure and how we can apply it to the social world.
4430104	4445834	516	D	0.99985	Then there is the self referential question that happens, which is what is the structure of active inference as a social construction itself and a political construction itself?
4446032	4461130	517	D	1.0	And what are our own like, our own what is our own political power and social power in this social and political world?
4461200	4471266	518	D	1.0	And this is the factor like thing that is going on because afterwards, what is my own social and political implication in this thing?
4471448	4495420	519	D	1.0	And the more you get your own agency and the agency of active inference, the more it becomes like a lot to process and the more you grasp your own agency and the power you have and the responsibility you have.
4496110	4501180	520	D	1.0	I guess this is one of the key points we are trying to get here.
4503310	4508154	521	D	0.68115	Yeah, I guess that's the point I wanted to make.
4508352	4520514	522	D	1.0	And to finish with that, the game we are trying to play is to try to found our own blind spots in this game.
4520632	4528980	523	D	0.92576	Like what is the limit of the model and does it have a self referential limit or not?
4532250	4533320	524	D	0.58537	That's it.
4536250	4542758	525	F	0.99972	Yeah, I would endorse that and I feel the same way.
4542844	4551210	526	F	1.0	I found that my reading just in the last year or so of active inference ideas, I found it very empowering.
4551710	4559834	527	F	1.0	The ideas of active inference in relation to the individual mind are quite well developed.
4559882	4569280	528	F	1.0	And it's very empowering to be able to look at yourself through the active inference paradigm and understand the thought processes that is you.
4569590	4571234	529	F	0.99562	It's a very empowering thing.
4571352	4589890	530	F	1.0	And as I was saying just recently, starting to look at the idea that we can incorporate an active inference concept of the way the social world around us is structured, which is part of that paradigm too, I think is potentially more empowering.
4589970	4606746	531	F	0.9998	But it's early days yet, but I look forward very much to a more developed world where people have discussions with each other, not just about what I'm thinking and how I think, but how I think about society and how we think about society together.
4606928	4610410	532	F	1.0	And it's embedded within that paradigm.
4610490	4615502	533	F	1.0	I feel that's potentially something which is very empowering and I look forward to it.
4615636	4620530	534	F	0.95	And thank the speakers all for their contributions to this series of talks.
4624460	4626036	535	B	0.99996	Thank you, Colin.
4626228	4641500	536	B	0.98287	So, with the exception of Ben, whose lecture and contribution kicked off this course and were excellent, also we have the others of the instructors here.
4641570	4648480	537	B	0.97428	So how do each of you want to kind of conclude this chapter?
4654530	4654942	538	B	0.96662	Yeah.
4654996	4657054	539	B	0.92837	Mao, then.
4657092	4657498	540	B	0.77913	Lorena?
4657514	4658350	541	B	0.46604	Raphael?
4658930	4659342	542	C	0.98772	Yes.
4659396	4694510	543	C	0.87	I think of entities which are the capability of interacting to maximize the information they gather from the environment such that as a whole, they can self evidence to maintain the phenotypes they believe to be similar to their own.
4694580	4711810	544	C	0.92	And therefore themselves and how this leads to over time, the sedimentation of norms and activities and eventually the reference to these norms and activities through the semantics and the scripts.
4712490	4735318	545	C	0.9	And effectively how this leads us to all the complexities of language and how we may now be at the point where we have simulacra that represents nothing, we just have these shells of representations and these shells of semantics which potentially have lost their anchoring in reality.
4735414	4738058	546	C	0.99941	So I think that was the through line of the course.
4738144	4746926	547	C	1.0	I hope we made a good case for it and how active inference allows us to model this entire path not only across scale, but across time as well.
4747108	4749760	548	C	0.99895	So, yeah, that's how I think I'm going to close.
4754350	4755930	549	E	0.97609	Yeah, I think this is me now.
4756000	4779338	550	E	0.93777	Yeah, I really like the story as well that we are building throughout the whole course, starting with a very general idea of what is active inference with Ben and then trying to build up this collective notion how we contain information in a certain way that it's always synchronized.
4779434	4786446	551	E	0.99649	So this is always sort of meaningful that can be described in certain ways by the mathematics of active inference.
4786558	4797990	552	E	0.98	And then understanding these questions, the hard questions that we're asking now, like how we can bring new variables, how can bring novelty into the system, which is something that we don't have an answer yet.
4798140	4810282	553	E	0.99137	But I find that it's really cool that we don't hold back in asking that because I think that's the next step for active, like understanding how complexification comes about.
4810336	4811740	554	E	0.99999	How can we describe that?
4812670	4816542	555	E	0.55228	Yeah, and thanks, Avel and Daniel, for putting this together.
4816596	4820670	556	E	0.83222	It was pretty cool and I hope you guys also have enjoyed.
4823250	4826110	557	B	0.99893	Thank you, Lorena AFO.
4828630	4830750	558	A	0.79783	So thank you, Lorena.
4830830	4831700	559	A	0.78701	You're welcome.
4833270	4857318	560	A	1.0	I think I put finger on something quite deep as usual, which is that if we want to have a coherent theory of nature that is not based on just here are the things that can be and we will draw dynamics on that that is compatible with operating evolution.
4857494	4869230	561	A	0.99995	We need to address self referentiality, we need to address recursion and the possibility for recursive individuation of physical beings.
4869730	4879698	562	A	1.0	And that's tough and that's very tough because the basis of representation is just I list array of things I want to represent and I represent that.
4879864	4890110	563	A	0.99971	But if things can just happen that are new and that are by definition not in the field of possibilities that preexisted, then we are fucked.
4890190	4892120	564	A	0.99999	There is no way we can represent that.
4892730	4914122	565	A	1.0	And there is a family of approach in quantum information theory that tries to tackle that how to draw physics without being rolling in a specific set space and just I'd like to explain the history of that.
4914176	4936980	566	A	0.9988	So the math it draws from algebraic topology, so we study surfaces, but not by studying surfaces, by studying transformation within those surfaces, but then we remove those surfaces and we keep only the transformation over what, I don't know, but somehow we can, I guess reconstruct coherent mathematical entity from that.
4937350	4943206	567	A	0.98	And I'd like us to take a look at how this look, what the math look like?
4943388	4946774	568	A	0.93831	So can we see the screen?
4946972	4953270	569	A	0.61096	Okay, so this is the structure of the quantum information formulation of the FEP.
4953710	4960460	570	A	0.9878	These are dimension of interaction between system A and system B.
4961230	4965234	571	A	0.99999	What defines the scope and the mode of this interaction?
4965382	4966526	572	A	0.99	I don't know.
4966708	4974858	573	A	1.0	And this is a cocon diagram that represents an agent together with the representation that he develops.
4975034	4980834	574	A	0.99	And I could tell you the words that correspond to the thing within this diagram, but I do not know what they mean.
4980872	4983314	575	A	0.99998	So it would be a hard thing to do.
4983512	4992822	576	A	0.98	And the math that is capable to tackle the self versatility like maybe because I do not see any proof that it actually does.
4992876	5012060	577	A	0.99994	In fact, it's not tractable for humans and I exclude mathematical physicists from humans there because of the sheer abstractness of what is going on and because of the lack of any abuse reference that from anything we intuitively understand in this.
5012430	5038834	578	A	0.65	And the work that we have to do if we want this to move forward and to have a self coherent theory of social evolution is to somehow entangle from that concrete meaning things that apply to the world and conversely, use the way that we can think of it as concrete interaction in the world to further specify the mathematics and prove that it is actually self coherent and applies to stuff.
5038952	5046722	579	A	1.0	And this is a big work in fact and this is kind of exciting.
5046786	5054632	580	A	1.0	I guess what I wanted to say is ActInf in France is dead.
5054696	5056380	581	A	0.99884	Long live active inference.
5060110	5060618	582	B	0.88772	Great.
5060704	5084286	583	B	0.98889	Well, it was a fun course, and this closing section and slide kind of brought this unity between Chris Fields's quantum work and this social science, which in the disciplinary paradigm are seen as distant or with different systems of interest.
5084468	5089822	584	B	1.0	And you can't get there from here, but in a scale free first principles paradigm.
5089966	5096562	585	B	0.99968	It's not even just that we can hold them side by side, it's that they are more than juxtaposed.
5096706	5110090	586	B	0.99815	So it's been awesome and its own great experience to work with all of the instructors who shared their amazing and youthful and energetic perspectives.
5110670	5115580	587	B	1.0	And we explored new format in a new way.
5116030	5132000	588	B	0.49257	We're going to process the proceedings of the lectures and the discussions, plus any final submitted question and answers through the Syllabus website.
5132550	5137378	589	B	0.99999	Bring that together into an open access publication of some kind.
5137544	5145320	590	B	0.99995	So for people who are interested in that kind of editorial or curatorial work, the active inference journal is for them.
5145690	5161302	591	B	1.0	And then in 2024 and beyond, let's see where active inference is, see where social sciences are, and hopefully, as people are interested in Take it from there.
5161436	5169454	592	B	0.99615	We threw in many fun ideas, but I guess we'll leave it till then to find out.
5169612	5172670	593	B	0.55206	You all right?
5172820	5173840	594	B	0.9999	Thank you, everybody.
5174530	5174890	595	B	0.62422	Bye.
