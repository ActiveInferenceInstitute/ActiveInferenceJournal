3930	38760	00:03	First instance of active inference for the social sciences. Avil, please give an overview of what we're going to do and talk about today. I'm sure we'll have many fun things to talk about and explore today.	Welcome to the first instance of active inference for the social sciences	Inclination for the Social Sciences
41210	277852	00:41	The goal of the session would be to assess what we talked about and how it is relevant or not to the practice of social sciences. How formally active inference accounts for agency and normativity and identity as a kind of integrated phenomenon. If you'd like, maybe pose a specific question or prompt.	Session on active inference for the social science aims to assess relevance	Active Inference for the Social Science
277986	950260	04:37	Active inference says that given specific patterns of DEMICAL coupling and of statistical repurposes, we have agent like behavior. The only action you have is mediated by sensory and external states. What we are formally is much more limited than what we agree the interpretation could be.	Active inference is a framework that provides geometry for that is not a very straightforward	Inference 6, Agency and the French principle
951350	1173660	15:51	So basically what we have in here is a formalism that deals from very basic dynamics like just web space and there is stuff that pensive space. From there we build a model of first self organization. And then we can build sensitively, more complex stuff that can implement higher order beliefs about themselves.	So you talked about the dual aspect of statistical organization of complex agents	The duality of agency and culturation
1174030	1566200	19:34	Avel: We could put the active inference paradigm into the individualistic methodological individualism framework in sociology. You could say that your internal states are totally influenced by another agent. We try more and more to challenge this notion of individualism by emphasizing the relational aspect of identity.	The active inference paradigm challenges individualistic methodological individualism in sociology	Active Inference in Social Networks
1566730	1633244	26:06	The importance of social scripts appears to be greater than the influence of individual upon individual. The whole idea of seeing a script as something which is social was something that probably most people would find a rather strange idea. Is that a fair assessment of what you're trying to say?	Maha says social scripts are more important than individual influence	Social Networks and the Script
1633282	1774490	27:13	The word identity has a lot of baggage and usage in current contemporary society. Are we using it in a different way? And if so, how is it different? How does that give us insight and the ability to engage with the ongoing discussions in society in a potentially fruitful way?	I wanted to ask about the difference between our conception of identity and the conception generally	The difference between our conceptions of identity
1774560	1950482	29:34	From an internalist perspective, social scripts are cognitive structures. They guide behaviors, they're acting like brackets. No semantic marker is a perfect guide. Everything is up for some degree of interpretation.	From an internalist perspective, social scripts are cognitive structures	Social Scripts and Cognition
1950616	2540830	32:30	The engagement with the world is a cyclic process, a circular process. It construct its own conditions. There is no measure of power of structure versus power of agents because the structure is embedded in the agents. The key is to have a coherent sense of identity.	David Frank Taylor describes the Unification Church in terms of choreography	The Life of the Cult
2541650	2748254	42:21	The model that we have, we have the external states and different agents, they are always actually very local and situated in the same local constraint local environment. That creates a dynamic that they can be then forgotten in a way that will develop agents together.	The model that we have, we have the external states and different agents	Anatomy 3, The Interaction of Agents
2748372	2942400	45:48	Self esteem to me is the degree of fitness relative to your perception of how well you're managing to exist within these constraints. Once you're there, you can grow in social cohesion and this will lead you to potentially try to maintain the group. If someone has low self esteem, what do they do?	Self esteem is the degree of fitness relative to social constraints	The dynamic nature of self-esteem
2955610	3145070	49:15	There is an individuality through active inference which emerge from the collective. Here we seem to grasp the interaction between the individual and the group. Moreover, there is what the individual adds to a group. I don't know what to say more about all of this.	I agree that I was wrong about associating active inference with individualism	Inactive Inference and Individualism
3154830	3363150	52:34	ActInf inference may give us computational models or even thorough grounded conceptual models of social organization. More specifically, I'm interested in the ways in which the ideas of active inference impact on the way we think about society and the way society works.	ActInf inference may give us computational models or even thorough grounded conceptual models	Challenges and Opportunities of Active Inference
3365680	3838192	56:05	Active inference is supposed to be scale free, so it describes or it is possible to help us describe the phenomena from sociology and literature to biology. Some challenges for active inference that are coming is, for instance, the complexity of social behavior.	Active inference is supposed to be scale free, so it describes across scales	Inactive Inference and the Complexity
3838326	4285010	1:03:58	The question we should seek after is what does active inference bring in. Currently the FEP doesn't do that in active inference. And that's a big challenge that we have ahead of us. Where that begins to bear or modify fruit is scientific and professional development of cognitive engineering.	The question we should seek after is what does active inference bring in	Cognitive Inference and the FEP
4287030	4402314	1:11:27	A and Colin, feel free to give in your marks and then we'll pass around the instructors. We like to think of active inference as nested in hierarchical. Individual agents can interact with each other and the environment, but the social system as a whole also interacts with the broader environment.	Question: Would the generative process of modeling the social system enclose multiple agents	Does the Social System Have a Single Markov Blanket?

The more you get your own agency and the agency of active inference, the more it becomes like a lot to process. The idea that we can incorporate an active inference concept of the way the social world around us is structured is potentially more empowering.	Effective in France has social and political implications due to its scale free structure	Active Inference at the Conference
4626228	4820670	1:17:06	Mao: How do each of you want to kind of conclude this chapter? Lorena? Raphael? Yes. I think that was the through line of the course. How active inference allows us to model this entire path not only across scale, but across time. And effectively how this leads us to all the complexities of language.	Mao: How do each of you want to conclude this chapter	A Day in the Life of Active Inference
4823250	5174890	1:20:23	If we want to have a coherent theory of nature that is compatible with operating evolution, we need to address self referentiality. The work that we have to do is to somehow entangle from that concrete meaning things that apply to the world. Long live active inference.	If we want to have a coherent theory of nature, we need self versatility	A week in the life of active inference
