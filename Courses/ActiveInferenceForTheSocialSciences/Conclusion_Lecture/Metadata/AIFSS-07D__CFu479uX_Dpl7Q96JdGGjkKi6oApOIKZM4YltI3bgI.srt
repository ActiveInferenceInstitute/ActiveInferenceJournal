1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,134
You. Hello.

2
00:00:07,252 --> 00:00:10,030
Welcome, everybody. It's November 1,

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,994
2023, and we are in the closing

4
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:17,520
discussion section for this

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,846
first instance of active inference for

6
00:00:20,868 --> 00:00:22,958
the social sciences. It's been a

7
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:25,134
journey. I'm sure we'll have many fun

8
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:28,720
things to talk about and explore today.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,534
So Avil, please take

10
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:35,426
it from here and maybe give an overview

11
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:38,134
of what we're going to do and talk about

12
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:41,622
today. Okay,

13
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:44,230
so this is the conclusion session of our

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,322
course on active inference for the

15
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:49,514
social science. We have talked

16
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,414
extensively about active inference,

17
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:54,154
maybe less extensively about for the

18
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:57,642
social science parts. So the goal of the

19
00:00:57,696 --> 00:01:00,110
session would be basically to assess

20
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,054
what we talked about and how it is

21
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:04,766
relevant or not to the practice of

22
00:01:04,788 --> 00:01:05,790
social sciences.

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,766
Basically, this is a discussion session,

24
00:01:10,798 --> 00:01:13,346
so there is no clear plan. But I'd like

25
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:17,006
to address how formally active inference

26
00:01:17,198 --> 00:01:20,086
accounts for agency and normativity and

27
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:22,002
identity as a kind of integrated

28
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:25,558
phenomenon, how it can compare or

29
00:01:25,644 --> 00:01:29,314
add to our ground or clash

30
00:01:29,362 --> 00:01:31,606
with, I don't know, sociological and

31
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:33,882
political. Model of agency and of social

32
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:36,022
evolution and of et cetera, et cetera.

33
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:37,866
All the topics that we addressed, which

34
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:41,258
are numerous and discuss

35
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:43,398
about the plausible future for active

36
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:45,470
inference, what it can be used to,

37
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,174
maybe what it will be used to,

38
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:50,778
certainly how it may change and how it's

39
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:55,758
relevant to yes,

40
00:01:55,844 --> 00:02:00,174
that is the crux

41
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:03,694
of it. We have brought in Alexey,

42
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:06,162
who is a philosopher interested in

43
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:08,514
social ontology, specifically the study

44
00:02:08,552 --> 00:02:11,098
of social kinds, which is from Kairos

45
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:14,194
Research. And I do not know who Colin

46
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:17,270
is, but he's with us. Hi, Colleen.

47
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,590
So how should we proceed? Danielle?

48
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,422
What do we do? If you'd like, maybe pose

49
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:29,690
a specific question or prompt,

50
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,726
which could be preceded by a statement,

51
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:35,014
and then we can all hear everyone's

52
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:38,170
voice on that. Okay,

53
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,762
so a good question would be ActInf

54
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:44,046
inference describes agency and

55
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:46,480
relativity and identity as a kind of

56
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,482
integrated phenomenon. I think we

57
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:53,682
should go over how precisely it

58
00:02:53,736 --> 00:02:54,340
works.

59
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,478
So, yes, let's do that. I will find

60
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:04,262
some, do you say,

61
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:06,274
illustration? That will make it easier.

62
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,758
But let's hear people's thoughts on

63
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:09,560
that, please.

64
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,444
Can you pose your question just a tad

65
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:18,244
more clearly? How are agency,

66
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:21,444
normativity and identity addressed

67
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,156
separately and together in active

68
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:23,960
inference?

69
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,600
Mao, go for it.

70
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,566
So I think we like to look at things in

71
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:39,106
terms of interrelations. In active

72
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:41,030
inference, nothing is defined by itself,

73
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,002
it's defined in relation to other

74
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,494
things. And this definition in relation

75
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,526
to other things also defines the types

76
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:50,522
of constraints that will be pushed on

77
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:52,362
the thing, which is separate from other

78
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,422
things. Once you have this, you

79
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:58,926
necessitate these interrelationships to

80
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:02,080
be formative ontological and

81
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,330
fundamentally contextual. So no

82
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,542
relationship is perfectly reproducible

83
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:12,546
across a different context. It will take

84
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:15,010
on a hermeneutics or semantics, given

85
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,326
the exact context of the spatial

86
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,010
temporality of the entities.

87
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,566
Those are some first thoughts. Does

88
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:25,894
anybody have big objections to what I

89
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:26,760
just said.

90
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,850
Okay.

91
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,328
Yeah, please continue. Sorry. Let's

92
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,124
start with the concept of agency. For

93
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:43,352
instance, agency is just action

94
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,712
selection, right? So agents are modeled.

95
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:48,876
They have a generative model and they

96
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:51,676
use it to predict sensory inputs based

97
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:55,288
on possible actions. They chatted,

98
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:57,216
select those to minimize the difference

99
00:04:57,318 --> 00:05:00,160
between predicted and sensory inputs.

100
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,676
So they're just trying to minimize free

101
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:04,196
energy. And this minimization is

102
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:07,044
fundamentally due to the relationship of

103
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:09,076
constraints in their environment. So

104
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:12,528
let's imagine that I am an individual

105
00:05:12,714 --> 00:05:17,944
who sorry,

106
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:21,944
I saw a comment and I didn't so

107
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:25,464
yeah, so you have an individual that

108
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:27,084
tries to exert control over the

109
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:29,244
environment. Now, if you scale this in

110
00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:32,204
nested structures, you can try to think

111
00:05:32,242 --> 00:05:35,048
of power structures and how agency

112
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:36,924
within those power structures is

113
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,496
modulated by the different kinds of

114
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:40,524
constraints that are both embedded

115
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:41,936
within the environment itself. Within

116
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,272
the materiality of the environment and

117
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:48,208
also within the normative aspects of

118
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:50,756
the nested structures which pull and

119
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:54,404
push an individual within certain

120
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,976
paths through some kinds of deontic

121
00:05:57,008 --> 00:06:00,116
cues. So that's how you get to the

122
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:02,276
notions of encoding agents beliefs and

123
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:04,296
preferences about the world within the

124
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:06,024
generative model through a form of

125
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:08,072
normativity, which is just a higher

126
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:11,656
precision over a specific type of

127
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:15,804
outcome or mapping. So your

128
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,116
prior beliefs here come from different

129
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:23,036
layers in the hierarchy and these act as

130
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:25,980
what we call culture or normativity.

131
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,016
I could stop here if you want to say

132
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,616
something. Apple so I agree with what

133
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:35,004
you said at a high level conceptual

134
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:38,096
scale, but I think it's important to be

135
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:40,336
clear about what formally governs the

136
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,936
statement because what we are formally

137
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,044
is much more limited than what we

138
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:47,572
agree the interpretation could be. So

139
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:51,460
can you see the screen I'm sharing?

140
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,484
Can you see the mouse doing AIDS?

141
00:06:56,612 --> 00:06:59,508
Yeah. Okay. So at core,

142
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:02,520
active inference is a framework that

143
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,344
provides geometry for that is

144
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:09,868
not a very straightforward way to

145
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:11,980
put it, but what we have is a system

146
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,016
with a space of state and we have a flow

147
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:17,356
of the system. A flow is a function that

148
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:21,232
basically tells you where specific point

149
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:24,268
goes with time. And what active

150
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:28,850
inference says is that given yes,

151
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,412
given specific patterns of DEMICAL

152
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:36,088
coupling and of statistical repurposes,

153
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:39,812
we have agent like behavior. So the

154
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:43,344
simplest kind of the basic requirement

155
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:45,756
of active inference of the French

156
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:48,244
principle, which is a core motivation

157
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:50,488
for active inference, is that you have a

158
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:52,408
limical system, so something with states

159
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:54,616
and a flow and some noise because we

160
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:57,244
need noise to get information. And it

161
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:59,870
has a boundary in the middle of it that

162
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,456
statistically separates the external

163
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:07,160
internal states. By statistically

164
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,730
separate, I mean that every information

165
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,624
about what's going on on there that

166
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,704
is in there, it disappears when

167
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:19,056
condition on there. So of information I

168
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:20,912
have about this that I could read here,

169
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:23,676
I can also read there. And that's subtly

170
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,356
different from the coupling. But this is

171
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:29,028
formalism, let's not get too much into

172
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:32,192
this. And then you have more complex

173
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:34,436
behavior when you can partition sensory

174
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:36,376
inactive states. And your particle, it

175
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:39,480
can do things in this specific context.

176
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,656
Basically we can write a geometry for

177
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:46,684
the fluctuation of the system and this

178
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:49,176
geometry entails belief over external

179
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,348
states. So these internal states, it

180
00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:54,248
knows thing in a sense about what's

181
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:57,224
going on out there through its coupling

182
00:08:57,352 --> 00:08:59,952
through sensory and active states and

183
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,352
the flow it has internally, the way its

184
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:08,256
internal states move, they entail a

185
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:10,724
displacement of their belief. And this

186
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:13,184
displacement happens to be near optimal

187
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:16,180
given Bayes constraints. Blah blah blah.

188
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,060
And the real interesting stuff happens

189
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,532
in the case of strange particles, which

190
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:25,144
are particles where as you can see,

191
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:28,980
there is no direct effect from actions,

192
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,768
active states to internal states.

193
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:33,944
The only action you have is mediated by

194
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:36,764
sensory and external states, in this

195
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:39,836
case the active states themselves. So

196
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:43,164
the policy of an agent, it becomes the

197
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:46,508
subject of beliefs of the agent. And if

198
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:48,976
it becomes the subject of beliefs, you

199
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:52,016
can have statistical inference. This is

200
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:55,008
the crux of this framework. And if you

201
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:56,496
can have statical inference, you can

202
00:09:56,518 --> 00:09:59,228
have like quite complex multilevel stall

203
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:02,052
inference over reward actions. And those

204
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:04,352
are basically what we call decision

205
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:08,676
taking or what we call planning. So what

206
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,756
we have here is formal architecture that

207
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,300
can derive the kind of complicated

208
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,692
agency, semantic, not only agency,

209
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:23,272
but agency that is embedded in a

210
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:26,184
specific conceptual framework that is

211
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:29,116
relative to this specific structure of

212
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:31,356
an agent and their environment and the

213
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:33,976
coupling in between. All that is traced

214
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,428
back basically to dynamics. So we have a

215
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:38,076
proof of existence that in a world that

216
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:40,208
everything is dynamics, we can have

217
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:42,204
agency, we can have complex decision

218
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:45,408
making under the form of inference over

219
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:48,864
one's own actions. And then

220
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:50,996
you have complications to apply it

221
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,332
directly, of course, because the world

222
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,228
is likely not in its barest form a

223
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:57,844
limical system. It does not have a list

224
00:10:57,882 --> 00:11:02,196
of states that are okay,

225
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,084
there is not a list of states that are

226
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,760
possible and that's it. And there is one

227
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,456
coupling that takes those states to

228
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:10,232
themselves and nothing can change ever.

229
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:12,410
This is not likely to be the case.

230
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,844
But we have a minimal model of agency

231
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,356
that is purely physicalist, that is

232
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:19,276
purely based on the causal relationship

233
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,976
in the most minimal way we can possibly

234
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:24,030
represent it. And this is quite huge.

235
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,272
And this gives us a very strong

236
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:31,744
prior over what is

237
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:34,544
the stuff that agency is made of. And

238
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:36,736
the stuff that agency is made of, at

239
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:39,584
least higher order agency that we think

240
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:41,332
about here in the social context is

241
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:44,100
belief over oneself. And so to control

242
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,936
actions is to control belief of oneself.

243
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:50,070
And this is this duality this

244
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,020
dual aspect of statistical organization

245
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,528
as a complex cognitive agent that is,

246
00:11:59,694 --> 00:12:02,168
in my opinion, at the moment, given the

247
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:04,004
capabilities of modeling and formalism.

248
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:07,400
We have the core contribution of

249
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,652
active inference to social sciences

250
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,152
written large psychology, neuroscience

251
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:15,116
like sense of social stuff because it

252
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:19,310
gives you very strong prior over

253
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,744
what agency is made of and the kind of

254
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,176
stuff that can exist out there in the

255
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:26,556
social world and the kind of dynamics

256
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:28,850
that bring about its stuff.

257
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,180
But there is a quite big bridge to be

258
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,172
made between the pure chemical system,

259
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:39,556
formalism of active inference and the

260
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,412
kind of topology evolution that happens

261
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:45,624
out there. And I do think there is high

262
00:12:45,662 --> 00:12:47,288
level of precaution to be taken when we

263
00:12:47,294 --> 00:12:51,448
talk about this kind of stuff. And yes,

264
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:56,348
does anyone want to react or agree

265
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:59,244
or disagree violently? Because I just

266
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:02,380
attacked the common creeds.

267
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,470
Not sure I perceived an attack perhaps

268
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,714
from what I understood of what you said.

269
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:15,134
Basically you have information geometry,

270
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,466
it formalizes a belief space in a sort

271
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:20,050
of geometric manifold.

272
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,046
The points represent possible belief

273
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,174
systems that an agent can have and

274
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:28,966
the distance between the points in the

275
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:30,838
space can be interpreted as a measure of

276
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,822
how different two belief systems are.

277
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:36,674
And this is necessarily tugged

278
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:40,454
by the priors given by the environment

279
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:44,106
which also push the agent to act in

280
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:45,706
a certain way given the type of thing

281
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:47,946
that it is, in order to maintain itself,

282
00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:50,350
given the actions that it knows it has

283
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,662
available. And this

284
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:56,654
becomes normative because of the

285
00:13:56,692 --> 00:14:00,014
strength of the

286
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:02,354
attractors within the belief space which

287
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:03,886
become the geometric landscape,

288
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:08,020
basically. So we can sort of model

289
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,866
the attraction through the curvature of

290
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:15,378
the space around the attractor. And so a

291
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:17,314
high curvature means a strong normative

292
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:20,006
force which pulls the agent to adopt a

293
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:22,018
certain, I like to say social scripts

294
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:23,382
because that's what I've worked on but

295
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:26,318
any sort of policy and or phenomenology

296
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:30,090
norm. And so in this context,

297
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,346
the agent's agency is kind of

298
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:34,954
complicated because it's both the

299
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:36,906
ability to sort of navigate the

300
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:39,214
landscape to move closer or further away

301
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:42,394
from the attractors. And so the degree

302
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,714
to which an agent has agency is a degree

303
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:47,470
to which it doesn't go necessarily

304
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,682
directly towards the attractor, but has

305
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:55,140
some degree of reflexivity over its own

306
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:00,114
action space in order to navigate the

307
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:03,686
different kinds of factors that

308
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,710
may be available to it. So we could see

309
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,270
that the momentum would be affected by

310
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,938
personal experiences, education, innate

311
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:15,314
tendencies or even the tendency

312
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:18,970
to resist or yield to

313
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,178
social pressures. I could go on, but I

314
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:23,338
know that a you have your hand up. So

315
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:24,620
why don't you go?

316
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,798
OK, I guess Avel could answer

317
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:34,446
before I talk a bit. So I was just

318
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:39,662
trying to have my hand raised before

319
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:42,146
talking. So if Avel wants to answer you

320
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:46,034
and afterwards I can talk, I'm OK.

321
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:49,570
I don't have anything specific to okay,

322
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,274
okay. So you talked about the dual

323
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:55,206
aspect of statistical organization of

324
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:58,806
complex agents and you said that it was

325
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:00,994
a core contribution of active influence

326
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:05,238
to social sciences. Can you

327
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:10,700
dig a bit on that and

328
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,234
just articulate it a bit more so we

329
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:18,326
could grasp it better and

330
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:20,640
then I could ask questions.

331
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,830
Do I still share my screen? Yes.

332
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,294
So basically what we have in here is

333
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:32,494
a formalism that deals from

334
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:36,082
very basic dynamics like just web

335
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:38,014
space and there is stuff that pensive

336
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:40,206
space. Zero level physical

337
00:16:40,238 --> 00:16:42,674
representation of literally anything can

338
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:46,102
go there. And from there we

339
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:48,854
build a model of first self

340
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:52,086
organization, not quite that

341
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:54,342
agentive self organization. Let us say

342
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:56,474
something that can build a specific

343
00:16:56,592 --> 00:16:59,498
stable ecology and maintain itself in

344
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:01,914
this ecology. That is what we have here.

345
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:05,174
And then given the lack of coupling

346
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:07,546
between active and tone states, we can

347
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,782
build sensitively, more complex stuff

348
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,706
that can implement higher order beliefs

349
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:18,782
about themselves and what they do and do

350
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,446
decision making that is conditioned on

351
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:21,950
information they have about themselves

352
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,378
and qualification under the form of

353
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,798
beliefs over their own action.

354
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:33,146
And as such, this is just math.

355
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:37,046
This says nothing about the world in and

356
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:39,426
of itself until we claim it corresponds

357
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,230
to things in the world. And we can claim

358
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,042
that this is a basic conceptual model

359
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:48,662
that maps well onto acculturation,

360
00:17:48,726 --> 00:17:50,986
basically socialization engagement with

361
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:54,106
the cultural world. Because then we can

362
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:57,580
account of the human ability for very

363
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,510
wide open ended learning as

364
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,174
something that comes from there, as

365
00:18:04,212 --> 00:18:06,094
something that allows us to infer things

366
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:07,834
about ourselves and then develop complex

367
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:10,646
policies and neck them blah blah, blah.

368
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:13,426
And because to my knowledge there is no

369
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:15,442
competing model that accounts for

370
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:21,774
anything near that competition,

371
00:18:21,822 --> 00:18:23,780
I should not talk of competition, but

372
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,614
the odd models of cognitive

373
00:18:27,662 --> 00:18:29,454
organization and culturation that exists

374
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:31,986
that are trying to ground themselves in

375
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:33,858
physics like an immigrant system. They

376
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,026
are just talking about dynamics. They

377
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,866
are specifically avoiding talking about

378
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:40,874
anything like content or semantics. So

379
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,698
they factor this piece of math as a

380
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,306
monopoly on building semantics from the

381
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:48,074
ground. And what it tells you is that

382
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:50,214
agency and identity and relativity is

383
00:18:50,272 --> 00:18:51,578
all the same phenomenon. It's

384
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:53,502
conditioned by self belief basically

385
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:55,598
that is constructed in this specific

386
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:56,320
way.

387
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,570
How to say because this is the only way

388
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,746
that we can account for higher order

389
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:07,538
agency. Then at

390
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:09,218
least I would argue we should have a

391
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:12,350
strong priors for a series of agency,

392
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,894
either mechanical or conceptual that

393
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:19,606
vibe well with that picture. So this is

394
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:22,726
the claim I'm making. I guess I went

395
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:24,646
into too much detail, so I hope this is

396
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:27,420
enough. Okay,

397
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,770
so I have some, maybe not questions,

398
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,940
but some points to make now. Thank you.

399
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,880
So from what I see here,

400
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,058
we could put the active inference

401
00:19:42,154 --> 00:19:45,150
paradigm into the individualistic

402
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,970
methodological individualism framework

403
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,874
in sociology. So the idea is that you

404
00:19:53,912 --> 00:19:57,026
try to model an individual and then when

405
00:19:57,048 --> 00:19:58,786
you have the good way to model the

406
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:01,394
individual, you can generalize to what

407
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:04,230
everyone is doing. So for instance,

408
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,382
if I'm working on something in

409
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:12,114
a certain way, then I could generalize

410
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:14,214
about that and say, okay,

411
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:17,914
sociologically I have this constraint to

412
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:21,866
work on this stuff. And then not

413
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,314
like everyone is doing that, but it

414
00:20:24,352 --> 00:20:27,770
could go like that. But what is

415
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,638
interesting here is that it's not only

416
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:33,600
about one individual, but also that,

417
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,826
for instance, let's take the external

418
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:39,386
states. You could say that external

419
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:42,098
states here are other agents,

420
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:43,860
and also that,

421
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,906
okay, so you have the active states and

422
00:20:49,928 --> 00:20:51,986
the internal states. So we could say

423
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:54,466
that your internal states are totally

424
00:20:54,578 --> 00:20:57,766
influenced by another agent. So we could

425
00:20:57,788 --> 00:20:59,766
do something like that with two

426
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:03,400
individuals, I guess. So one is

427
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,938
one of the agent here and the other

428
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:08,714
drives the internal states of the model

429
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:13,194
because they are really influential on

430
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:17,210
yourself. So there are some limitations

431
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,638
about this kind of way of thinking

432
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:22,880
because in general,

433
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,914
in sociology or in sociological

434
00:21:29,962 --> 00:21:32,114
sciences, what you would like to say is

435
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:34,322
that there are some agents at a higher

436
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,786
level than only individuals such as you

437
00:21:36,808 --> 00:21:40,402
and I. So the trick could be

438
00:21:40,536 --> 00:21:44,302
to say that some states, for instance,

439
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:48,562
or some firms are agents foreign

440
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:51,286
by themselves. So you have agents which

441
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:54,310
are not individuals or persons.

442
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,106
I don't understand what you're trying to

443
00:22:00,128 --> 00:22:04,106
say, Avel I was

444
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:08,010
just trying to react to your slide

445
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,680
because I don't see how it connects with

446
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,614
my own work here yet. Oh, I'm talking to

447
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:19,520
Mao. Okay, nice.

448
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,426
So yeah, if Mao, you have something to

449
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:26,994
say about what I just said, about how we

450
00:22:27,032 --> 00:22:30,580
could have, let's say, two active agents

451
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,820
trying to talk together?

452
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,762
Yeah, we have such simulations

453
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:43,202
that already exist over various

454
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:46,034
kinds of scales. We have two agents

455
00:22:46,172 --> 00:22:49,798
coordinating that are animals like birds

456
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:52,394
singing, and over time coordinating over

457
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:55,034
the song they're going to sing. We have

458
00:22:55,152 --> 00:22:57,574
several models of leader follower,

459
00:22:57,702 --> 00:23:01,446
where you have two

460
00:23:01,488 --> 00:23:02,926
agents starting from relatively the same

461
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,494
point, but one agent developing more

462
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:06,638
confidence and therefore developing a

463
00:23:06,644 --> 00:23:08,526
dynamic of leader follower with the

464
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:09,946
other agent. This is work that's

465
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:14,034
possibly going to be followed by

466
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:16,338
Francesco Balzan, who is working on

467
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:19,154
models of education and how maybe the

468
00:23:19,192 --> 00:23:22,254
teacher and student dynamic may be cast

469
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:24,646
under these terms. I've done work with

470
00:23:24,668 --> 00:23:28,006
Axel Constant and Maxwell Ramstead in

471
00:23:28,028 --> 00:23:31,062
terms of active inference in social

472
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:33,602
scripts. That's what Ava was mentioning.

473
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:37,206
And this notion that through the

474
00:23:37,228 --> 00:23:39,882
cues of the environment, your own model

475
00:23:40,016 --> 00:23:41,962
is shaped both by the environment which

476
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:44,346
includes other people, and the way in

477
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:45,834
which you self evidence within this

478
00:23:45,872 --> 00:23:47,530
environment. So for instance,

479
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,734
there's two ways we can understand your

480
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:52,960
question. First, we can say that

481
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,894
minimizing free energy is

482
00:23:56,932 --> 00:23:59,086
basically an agent that has a form of

483
00:23:59,108 --> 00:24:01,054
autonomy and it's constantly updating

484
00:24:01,102 --> 00:24:02,974
its model to align with the environment.

485
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:05,746
So by virtue of doing this, it's not

486
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:09,842
fundamentally individual, but each

487
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:12,530
agent has its own model of the world.

488
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,214
Each agent reflects a perspective, a

489
00:24:16,252 --> 00:24:21,014
very unique moment in spacetime that

490
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:23,734
will incur some errors relative to

491
00:24:23,772 --> 00:24:25,222
others. So it's not that they

492
00:24:25,276 --> 00:24:26,954
necessarily interpreted things wrong,

493
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:30,138
although they might have, but because

494
00:24:30,224 --> 00:24:32,074
their perspective is slightly off from

495
00:24:32,112 --> 00:24:33,946
somebody else. There's necessarily a

496
00:24:33,968 --> 00:24:36,394
degree of incommunicability in this

497
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:40,094
sense. So here, self evidencing really

498
00:24:40,132 --> 00:24:43,386
entails that identity.

499
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:46,046
You create a sort of identity here

500
00:24:46,228 --> 00:24:48,574
through the fact that you may have

501
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,874
different preferred states from somebody

502
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:52,466
else based on your values, belief, your

503
00:24:52,488 --> 00:24:54,914
social conditioning. But again, these

504
00:24:55,032 --> 00:24:56,850
beliefs and values and social

505
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,250
conditioning have been shaped.

506
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,206
Again, we're talking about these trove

507
00:25:02,238 --> 00:25:04,120
of attractors by other people.

508
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,354
And so we try more and more to challenge

509
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:11,046
this notion of individualism by

510
00:25:11,068 --> 00:25:13,702
emphasizing the relational aspect of

511
00:25:13,756 --> 00:25:17,066
identity, which means that identity is

512
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:19,750
not pre established but continuously

513
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,266
formed through the interactions with

514
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,826
other agents. And again, if we go back

515
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:27,818
to information geometry, the geometry of

516
00:25:27,824 --> 00:25:29,374
the information space influences how

517
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:31,262
agents perceive their paths towards

518
00:25:31,316 --> 00:25:33,374
minimizing free energy and affect their

519
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:35,854
choices, which again give you the

520
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:39,358
possibility to understand how agents

521
00:25:39,524 --> 00:25:42,862
might be very strongly pushed by other

522
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,154
agents. Let's imagine an agent that has

523
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:47,666
more power than you and is trying to

524
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:49,442
influence you to do something, someone

525
00:25:49,496 --> 00:25:52,050
that has very high charisma or someone

526
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,374
who has the power to say destroy your

527
00:25:54,412 --> 00:25:57,510
life. You are more likely to shape your

528
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,720
beliefs to align with,

529
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,110
and therefore we can understand

530
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,062
individualism under a very different

531
00:26:05,116 --> 00:26:07,946
light here. Avel, do you want to add

532
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:11,386
something? Colleen is waiting to speak

533
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:14,010
since moments. So let's hear. Colleen.

534
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,384
Hi, can you hear?

535
00:26:21,422 --> 00:26:24,536
Okay, I just wanted to pick on

536
00:26:24,638 --> 00:26:26,684
a couple of things that Maha was talking

537
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:30,556
about just now. And in her talk

538
00:26:30,738 --> 00:26:34,450
it seems that you seem to be saying that

539
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,088
for social conditioning and the way in

540
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:40,332
which we are socialized, the importance

541
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:43,276
of social scripts appears to be greater

542
00:26:43,388 --> 00:26:47,068
than the influence of individual upon

543
00:26:47,244 --> 00:26:49,140
individual. And that's interesting

544
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,564
because it's not something that we would

545
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:53,796
tend to think as individuals that we are

546
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:56,516
integrating with scripts. In fact, the

547
00:26:56,538 --> 00:26:58,624
whole idea of seeing a script as

548
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:00,744
something which is social was something

549
00:27:00,782 --> 00:27:02,104
that I find that probably most people

550
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:06,856
would find a rather strange idea off

551
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:08,120
the top of our heads.

552
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,728
Is that a fair assessment of what you're

553
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:13,996
trying to say? And the other thing I

554
00:27:14,018 --> 00:27:17,070
wanted to ask about was a few times

555
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,456
in talks recently and here today, I've

556
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:23,336
heard people talking about identity and

557
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:26,880
the active inference view of

558
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,584
identity. I'm not sure that I really

559
00:27:29,622 --> 00:27:33,088
understand what identity means within an

560
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:35,356
active inference framework as distinct

561
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:37,236
from just our internal model of who we

562
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:40,950
are. Is there another idea that

563
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,372
we're thinking of here? And more

564
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:48,708
particularly, the word identity has a

565
00:27:48,714 --> 00:27:50,408
lot of baggage and usage in current

566
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:53,288
contemporary society. Are we using it in

567
00:27:53,294 --> 00:27:55,530
a different way? And if so,

568
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,452
how is it different? And potentially,

569
00:27:58,516 --> 00:28:00,776
how does that give us insight and the

570
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:02,856
ability to engage with the ongoing

571
00:28:02,888 --> 00:28:05,144
discussions in society in a potentially

572
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:06,190
fruitful way.

573
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,244
So I think I lost you for the last part

574
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:15,876
of your question, which seemed to be

575
00:28:15,898 --> 00:28:17,864
about the difference between our

576
00:28:17,902 --> 00:28:21,112
conception of identity and the

577
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,556
conception generally used. If that's

578
00:28:23,588 --> 00:28:24,170
correct.

579
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,400
You'Re muted Colin.

580
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,706
Sorry. Yeah, I was referring to the

581
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:40,410
concept of identity as used in society.

582
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,986
Right. So, I mean, I'm not going to

583
00:28:45,008 --> 00:28:47,834
speak to every use of the term identity

584
00:28:47,882 --> 00:28:50,874
because it's a very useful term that's

585
00:28:50,922 --> 00:28:53,690
used in law, that's used in physics,

586
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,642
it's used in sociology and psychology.

587
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:59,374
So it's used a lot. All I can do is

588
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:02,094
explain roughly how we consider identity

589
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:04,226
formation and then if you have a

590
00:29:04,248 --> 00:29:06,066
specific definition in mind for a

591
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:07,906
specific field, we can maybe tackle that

592
00:29:07,928 --> 00:29:10,980
one. Does that sound okay?

593
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,590
Yeah. To be clear, I was thinking

594
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,494
specifically about identity as

595
00:29:15,532 --> 00:29:16,966
determined by group membership in

596
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:20,680
sociology. Okay.

597
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,274
So I'm going to tackle social scripts

598
00:29:24,322 --> 00:29:25,800
first. Yeah,

599
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,234
I'm going to tackle social scripts first

600
00:29:30,272 --> 00:29:31,226
and then I'm going to come back to

601
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:33,286
identity because I think it fits plea.

602
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:35,034
I've worked on that as well. I know that

603
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:36,842
Daniel and Avel have some work that

604
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,470
relates to this as but so your first

605
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,702
question was on the importance of social

606
00:29:42,756 --> 00:29:44,634
scripts and what it means for cognition,

607
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:47,806
if I understood correctly. So from an

608
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,490
internalist perspective,

609
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,990
social scripts are cognitive structures.

610
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,414
They guide behaviors, they're acting

611
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:01,134
like brackets. We use the word

612
00:30:01,192 --> 00:30:02,600
constraints a lot.

613
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,182
It's not a perfect guide because no

614
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:10,498
semantic marker is a perfect guide.

615
00:30:10,594 --> 00:30:12,454
Everything is up for some degree of

616
00:30:12,492 --> 00:30:14,506
interpretation. It's just that there are

617
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,180
some interpretations that are so

618
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,266
strongly linked to some degree of

619
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:22,906
embodiment that they sort of anchor the

620
00:30:22,928 --> 00:30:25,142
rest of our semantics. So, for instance,

621
00:30:25,206 --> 00:30:27,246
I can't stop breathing if I wanted to.

622
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:29,646
I can't. I will stop, but eventually my

623
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:32,574
body will restart on its own. And so

624
00:30:32,692 --> 00:30:35,982
there's such kinds of natural laws here

625
00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:39,540
that create these

626
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,186
bottom layer guidelines that can then be

627
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,554
sort of derived to infer other things.

628
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:47,540
And social scripts are just

629
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,570
representational,

630
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,050
social extensions of these constraints

631
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,182
given a historical context. So they

632
00:31:00,236 --> 00:31:02,520
model and.

633
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,230
Did Mal drop or did I drop?

634
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,362
I guess it's they're given to you. Like

635
00:31:16,496 --> 00:31:18,666
somebody will actually tell you what to

636
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:21,498
do and show it to you. And sometimes

637
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:23,306
they won't be. Sometimes they're just

638
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:24,746
things you observe. Sometimes there's

639
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:26,766
things you infer because you made a

640
00:31:26,788 --> 00:31:28,654
connection between a weak script and

641
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:30,414
another weak script. So if you see

642
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:33,006
something that resembles a chair in a

643
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:34,926
room, you infer that, you have the

644
00:31:34,948 --> 00:31:36,686
affordance to sit on it. So that's a

645
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,594
form of script. And then you see other

646
00:31:38,632 --> 00:31:39,966
people doing the same and the script

647
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:43,250
sort of cements. And so now you

648
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,138
associate this to another part of a

649
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:47,480
sequence, and this becomes something

650
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,734
that allows you to temporalize and

651
00:31:51,772 --> 00:31:53,526
basically leverage your B matrix in

652
00:31:53,548 --> 00:31:55,526
order to exist in the world in a way

653
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:57,862
that doesn't cause friction with other

654
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,274
people. This also gives you action

655
00:32:00,322 --> 00:32:02,186
triggers. There are things you see in

656
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:04,538
the world that now tell you this is the

657
00:32:04,544 --> 00:32:06,314
thing you should do now. So there's this

658
00:32:06,352 --> 00:32:09,674
sort of recursive loop that's very

659
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:11,994
inactive, that pulls you in a direction.

660
00:32:12,042 --> 00:32:14,782
So the attractor isn't just a state,

661
00:32:14,836 --> 00:32:17,006
it's a path. You're going to go down a

662
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:20,558
path. So for now, does that answer the

663
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,774
first question? Yes.

664
00:32:23,812 --> 00:32:26,820
Thanks. It's helpful. Okay,

665
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,538
go ahead. Thank you. To get back on

666
00:32:31,544 --> 00:32:33,166
the like, you talked about an active

667
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:35,502
loop, and I think that's a critical

668
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:38,838
thing to underline, which is that the

669
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:41,506
engagement with the world is a cyclic

670
00:32:41,538 --> 00:32:43,062
process, a circular process. It

671
00:32:43,116 --> 00:32:45,590
construct its own conditions.

672
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,634
There is no measure of power of

673
00:32:52,672 --> 00:32:55,882
structure versus power of agents because

674
00:32:55,936 --> 00:32:58,298
the structure is embedded in the agents

675
00:32:58,384 --> 00:33:00,666
and the agents are embedded in the

676
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:03,774
structure. So I'd like to share my

677
00:33:03,812 --> 00:33:07,422
screen again to give some detail over

678
00:33:07,476 --> 00:33:09,150
what this entails.

679
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,574
Good window. You should see a PDF with a

680
00:33:14,612 --> 00:33:18,718
tiny man personal montaigne

681
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:22,100
and loops. Is it

682
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:26,194
okay? Yes. I see.

683
00:33:26,232 --> 00:33:29,894
Yes. So this is a presentation I did

684
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:32,450
recently about the Unification Church,

685
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:35,750
which is like when you want to be

686
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,474
published, you say new religious

687
00:33:37,522 --> 00:33:39,126
movement, but you can say cult. It

688
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:41,734
works, which originated, I think, in

689
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,634
Japan and is now spread between Korea,

690
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:46,474
Japan, and it says mostly we don't have

691
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:49,222
numbers, but it seems to be the places

692
00:33:49,286 --> 00:33:53,134
where it's most implanted. And it

693
00:33:53,172 --> 00:33:56,622
was very remarked because of the

694
00:33:56,676 --> 00:33:58,506
personality cult around the Reverend

695
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:01,578
Moon, the founder, and the very overt

696
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:04,058
exorcist practices of the cult, like

697
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:06,226
asking you for the equivalent of ten

698
00:34:06,248 --> 00:34:11,858
years of salary at the time to

699
00:34:11,944 --> 00:34:13,826
take your ancestors from hell and put

700
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:15,666
them in paradise by giving money to

701
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:20,854
Reverend Moon specifically. And they

702
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,898
were the topic of very aggressive

703
00:34:24,994 --> 00:34:30,042
and excessive anticult movement in the

704
00:34:30,096 --> 00:34:32,074
they are becoming a bit noticed again by

705
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,014
vice, not only vice,

706
00:34:35,062 --> 00:34:38,394
but notably vice, because you have very

707
00:34:38,592 --> 00:34:43,162
strange things like mass MAGA weddings

708
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:46,720
with people waving rifle and that is

709
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,526
very strange organization. And at the

710
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:53,914
time you had very moral

711
00:34:53,962 --> 00:34:56,340
panic, we say now, around the cult.

712
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,046
You had basically a model of influence

713
00:35:00,078 --> 00:35:01,922
that was that evil people would

714
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:04,018
brainwash you and then you were

715
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,834
commanded by the cult and or Soviet

716
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:09,446
secret agents from afar, and they could

717
00:35:09,548 --> 00:35:12,530
say to you, horse. And this triggered

718
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,706
homocydal mania in which you blah,

719
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,920
blah, blah. So things that are

720
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:21,394
unnaturalistic, I will say, and notably

721
00:35:21,442 --> 00:35:23,126
in reaction to the immoral panic, you

722
00:35:23,148 --> 00:35:24,918
had a movement biologists of religion

723
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:26,762
that would try to understand how exactly

724
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:30,406
the cult worked. And the most famous

725
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:32,138
sociologist to do that was Aileen

726
00:35:32,154 --> 00:35:35,930
Barker, if I remember, was she warned

727
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,062
the money she was coming. So you can

728
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:41,422
question her methodology, but she seems

729
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:44,994
to have done the most thorough and well

730
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:47,602
received analysis of them. So it's quite

731
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:49,954
important thing and she questions that

732
00:35:49,992 --> 00:35:52,126
there is such a thing as brainwashing.

733
00:35:52,238 --> 00:35:54,082
There is construction of a specific

734
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:56,654
social context that you have to comply

735
00:35:56,702 --> 00:35:58,934
to if you want to come, but they can

736
00:35:58,972 --> 00:36:00,918
force you, they do not have the

737
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:04,374
capability to torture you and make you

738
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,166
into RC radio community thing that does

739
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:12,054
not work. And so I forgot the name of

740
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:16,510
the so David Frank Taylor explains

741
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,050
the influence of the church in terms of

742
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,066
choreography of total participation. So

743
00:36:21,088 --> 00:36:23,966
basically you have a very huge, very

744
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:28,014
emotionally investing ritual that you

745
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,106
just have to take part in to be a member

746
00:36:30,138 --> 00:36:32,878
of the community. And if you are a

747
00:36:32,884 --> 00:36:34,046
member of your community, you will be

748
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:35,426
helped, you will be loved, you will be

749
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:37,998
supported, you will be constantly

750
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:40,818
encouraged in a slightly coercive way to

751
00:36:40,904 --> 00:36:42,594
invest more of your time and money and

752
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:46,834
whatever in the organization. And if

753
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,270
you don't, then all the support just

754
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,094
leaves because you're a traitor. You

755
00:36:53,132 --> 00:36:56,774
have treason of the

756
00:36:56,812 --> 00:37:00,134
true parents who was kindly out of

757
00:37:00,172 --> 00:37:03,594
this own arts trying to save you like

758
00:37:03,632 --> 00:37:05,542
Jesus did, but better because Jesus

759
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:08,794
failed by not having children. That is

760
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:10,506
very dramatic thing to say and that is

761
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,822
what they said. And because of the way

762
00:37:13,876 --> 00:37:17,850
the organization is set up, you cannot

763
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,286
possibly question that. Questioning is

764
00:37:20,308 --> 00:37:23,774
not accepted. There is no private time

765
00:37:23,812 --> 00:37:25,282
in which you can privately question

766
00:37:25,336 --> 00:37:27,346
yourself. You are always engaged with

767
00:37:27,368 --> 00:37:30,354
people who are either formally or

768
00:37:30,392 --> 00:37:32,366
informally depending on your seniority

769
00:37:32,478 --> 00:37:35,010
watching you. And so you have basically

770
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,346
a context that makes it very easy to

771
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:40,514
align with the cult values and

772
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,854
it just happens that those values they

773
00:37:42,892 --> 00:37:44,998
entail self sacrifice for the

774
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:47,158
organization but also for new members

775
00:37:47,324 --> 00:37:50,794
and total deference to the cult and

776
00:37:50,832 --> 00:37:52,426
its leadership and anything they tell

777
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:56,442
you to do. So it's not

778
00:37:56,496 --> 00:37:58,794
kidnapping, but it's also not exactly

779
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:02,506
free consent to a specific context.

780
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:05,738
And from a purely, I don't

781
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:08,170
know what to say mechanical perspective

782
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,254
they can make you agree when you are

783
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:12,814
there, but they cannot make you go

784
00:38:12,852 --> 00:38:16,222
there. So a question is how precisely

785
00:38:16,286 --> 00:38:20,210
they can elicit compliance away

786
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,954
from the direct context of the

787
00:38:21,992 --> 00:38:24,386
choreography of participation. And there

788
00:38:24,408 --> 00:38:26,902
is like simple answer in my sense,

789
00:38:26,956 --> 00:38:30,754
which is that we have a coherent

790
00:38:30,802 --> 00:38:33,206
sense of identity. We can hardly think

791
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:36,370
of ourselves as a good money 1 minute

792
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,622
and then step out of the meeting and not

793
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:42,058
think of ourselves as a good money.

794
00:38:42,144 --> 00:38:44,234
That doesn't make sense. Either we are

795
00:38:44,272 --> 00:38:46,086
or we are not. At least most people tend

796
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:48,746
to have one integrated sense of

797
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:51,226
themselves as someone who is embedded in

798
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:52,794
a specific social context and has

799
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:55,760
specific norms and they are in such way.

800
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,034
And so the coherence of self identity,

801
00:38:59,082 --> 00:39:02,702
it provides a key coupling between your

802
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:04,594
public and your private beliefs, what

803
00:39:04,632 --> 00:39:06,414
you are expected to do in social context

804
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:08,866
and what you will effectively do and

805
00:39:08,968 --> 00:39:12,370
perceive the world as privately. And

806
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,194
this I would say in the example

807
00:39:16,232 --> 00:39:18,082
of the Munis, but in other rhetorical

808
00:39:18,146 --> 00:39:20,566
examples like the emergence of

809
00:39:20,588 --> 00:39:23,254
nationalism. It is a very

810
00:39:23,372 --> 00:39:26,578
straightforward confirmation that indeed

811
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:29,098
coherence of self identity, like the

812
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:31,066
coherence between what you do and what

813
00:39:31,088 --> 00:39:33,180
you think of yourself as doing,

814
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:38,426
is a very important process in

815
00:39:38,448 --> 00:39:40,166
the structure of societies, generally

816
00:39:40,198 --> 00:39:41,334
speaking, at least contemporary

817
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:43,594
societies. Maybe it was not the same

818
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:45,934
before. And so I do not think the

819
00:39:45,972 --> 00:39:47,678
context in which it's mobilized, of

820
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:49,374
course it changes, but the mechanism, I

821
00:39:49,412 --> 00:39:52,206
don't think it's new. And I'd like to

822
00:39:52,228 --> 00:39:55,022
get back on Alex's point that sorry,

823
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:58,740
a's point that the approach we have is

824
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,306
individualistic. I do not think it is

825
00:40:02,328 --> 00:40:04,420
the case because if we are correct,

826
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,918
there is a landscape of sociocultural

827
00:40:08,014 --> 00:40:11,782
affordencies constraints, things world

828
00:40:11,836 --> 00:40:13,798
out there and we engage with it. And

829
00:40:13,804 --> 00:40:15,574
there are mechanism that makes this

830
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:18,882
landscape not necessarily identical but

831
00:40:18,956 --> 00:40:21,402
very coherent between individuals. And

832
00:40:21,456 --> 00:40:24,426
those mechanism are language and the

833
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:26,326
material symbolism developing ritual,

834
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:28,810
which is also symbolism, also

835
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,066
meaningful, but maybe less than

836
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:33,806
language. I don't know. I just mean that

837
00:40:33,828 --> 00:40:36,640
the mechanism is the same and the

838
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,386
interculturally robust practice of role

839
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:42,446
taking and shared essentialities of

840
00:40:42,468 --> 00:40:46,370
trying to do stuff together given

841
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,714
a specific model of the

842
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:52,414
attribution of tasks within the shared

843
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:55,582
goal and so these are human invariants

844
00:40:55,646 --> 00:40:58,594
and all would be pretty good candidate

845
00:40:58,642 --> 00:41:01,190
to force the integration of a common

846
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,306
model of material and cultural niche.

847
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:08,086
And so I think that there is

848
00:41:08,108 --> 00:41:09,554
a pretty coherent, social material

849
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:13,126
niche, and I think that we all engage

850
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:14,874
with it and we all modify it, and we

851
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:17,882
maybe do not perceive it as the same,

852
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:20,074
but there is still a strong enough

853
00:41:20,112 --> 00:41:23,614
constraints on the coherence of this

854
00:41:23,652 --> 00:41:25,662
landscape between individuals for it to

855
00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:28,094
make sense as a specific entity. And

856
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:30,766
then the proper explanatory scale of

857
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,418
what we do is not the individual minds,

858
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:35,566
it is landscape that we happen to

859
00:41:35,588 --> 00:41:37,322
experience because of our individual

860
00:41:37,396 --> 00:41:41,646
minds. So by the plateau

861
00:41:41,678 --> 00:41:45,298
academia of Stanford on Holism basically

862
00:41:45,384 --> 00:41:47,426
Holism is a theory where you agree that

863
00:41:47,448 --> 00:41:50,166
there are explanations that are not

864
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:52,998
mediated by individual states. And I say

865
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:54,934
there are explanation that are not

866
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:57,126
inherited by individual states. And not

867
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,646
only that, but I can point to

868
00:41:58,668 --> 00:42:01,270
organization that control people while

869
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,826
being absolutely not worried about

870
00:42:02,848 --> 00:42:04,218
individual states only creating a

871
00:42:04,224 --> 00:42:06,106
circumstance and then allowing them to

872
00:42:06,128 --> 00:42:09,146
engage with it. And that would

873
00:42:09,168 --> 00:42:10,794
be compelling, in my opinion, to say

874
00:42:10,832 --> 00:42:12,794
that the model we have is maybe not

875
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:15,194
Holist, maybe a secret third thing that

876
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,774
is multiscale but certainly not

877
00:42:17,812 --> 00:42:19,454
individualist, at least in the sense

878
00:42:19,492 --> 00:42:22,640
that you are mobilizing. Thank you.

879
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,690
I talked more than I wanted. So Mao,

880
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,258
you were raising your hands. I am, but I

881
00:42:30,264 --> 00:42:31,986
think Lorena wants to go. I will go

882
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,250
after Lorena.

883
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,510
Hey, guys. Yeah, I think that goes

884
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,862
directly into the idea that coming

885
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,494
back a little bit to the point that

886
00:42:45,612 --> 00:42:47,814
identity they were talking before. And

887
00:42:47,852 --> 00:42:49,386
if you think about the model that we

888
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:53,194
have, we have the external states and

889
00:42:53,232 --> 00:42:55,018
different agents, they are always

890
00:42:55,104 --> 00:43:00,138
actually very local and situated in

891
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,042
the same local constraint local

892
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:04,346
environment. Right. So your external

893
00:43:04,378 --> 00:43:07,710
agent is going to be part other agents

894
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,546
are going to be part of your external

895
00:43:09,578 --> 00:43:11,482
states and you are part of theirs.

896
00:43:11,546 --> 00:43:15,566
Right. So the idea of laying down a path

897
00:43:15,678 --> 00:43:18,210
and creating a specific type of dynamic

898
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,850
that react to the same type

899
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,306
of input that you are receiving and

900
00:43:26,408 --> 00:43:30,034
driving this dynamic will generate

901
00:43:30,082 --> 00:43:31,782
this sort of embeddedness right.

902
00:43:31,836 --> 00:43:35,480
Because you do have the same.

903
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,286
Or. No, it's not necessarily the same,

904
00:43:39,308 --> 00:43:41,194
but they're very close to each other,

905
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:42,826
they're very approximate. Right. So the

906
00:43:42,848 --> 00:43:45,354
idea of a dynamic here, if you think

907
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:48,700
about describing that in terms of

908
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,506
like, in terms of the dynamics, you do

909
00:43:52,528 --> 00:43:55,390
have very different Lawrence

910
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,302
butterflies, for instance. Each one goes

911
00:43:58,356 --> 00:44:00,058
through the same type of route.

912
00:44:00,234 --> 00:44:01,998
However, they're not identical, but they

913
00:44:02,004 --> 00:44:03,662
are very similar. They are doing

914
00:44:03,716 --> 00:44:06,222
something very similar and that

915
00:44:06,356 --> 00:44:10,306
similarity sort of constrains, again the

916
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:12,466
construction of that environment. So if

917
00:44:12,488 --> 00:44:15,140
you think about symbols and roles and

918
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,342
types of environment that you find,

919
00:44:18,476 --> 00:44:20,134
they're going to be as concrete as

920
00:44:20,172 --> 00:44:21,686
something else that you find in your

921
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,986
environment. Constraining and pushing

922
00:44:24,018 --> 00:44:27,158
you towards the same direction or at

923
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,894
least a very similar you can describe

924
00:44:29,942 --> 00:44:32,890
dynamically in a very similar type of

925
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,394
geometry if you like, or this

926
00:44:36,432 --> 00:44:38,330
attractor will drive the very similar

927
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,722
type of path. Will describe this similar

928
00:44:41,776 --> 00:44:45,130
type of path which

929
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,046
goes exactly to the Avel. Can you go

930
00:44:48,068 --> 00:44:49,120
back to that?

931
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,410
The other figure that you have, the one

932
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,282
with the environment as well made

933
00:44:59,336 --> 00:45:03,218
by yeah, that one. So exactly.

934
00:45:03,304 --> 00:45:05,874
That creates a dynamic that they can be

935
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,238
then forgotten in a way that

936
00:45:09,324 --> 00:45:11,798
will be described through a specific

937
00:45:11,884 --> 00:45:16,600
mark of blank that will develop agents

938
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:21,206
together. We push them constraining,

939
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,650
they're going to be constrained together

940
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,730
and they're going to have a constructive

941
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:30,490
kind of role

942
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,270
in this very embedded normativity.

943
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,960
But yeah, you go.

944
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,838
Thanks. Yeah. So I think there's a nice

945
00:45:41,924 --> 00:45:43,886
way to tie all this as well to the

946
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,160
internal nature that we seem to be

947
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,846
dispelling, but we're not. We have to

948
00:45:48,868 --> 00:45:51,166
talk about specifically in what ways

949
00:45:51,268 --> 00:45:55,006
internality is cast here. And I

950
00:45:55,028 --> 00:45:58,166
like to think of the effect of self

951
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,654
esteem here. Self esteem to me is the

952
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,022
degree of fitness relative to your

953
00:46:04,076 --> 00:46:07,282
perception of how well you're managing

954
00:46:07,426 --> 00:46:10,074
to exist within these constraints and

955
00:46:10,112 --> 00:46:12,810
interpret them in a way that gets other

956
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,106
people to validate and minimize the

957
00:46:16,128 --> 00:46:17,434
friction that you're getting from other

958
00:46:17,472 --> 00:46:20,838
people. So it aligns

959
00:46:20,854 --> 00:46:22,634
with the concept of sociometer theory.

960
00:46:22,682 --> 00:46:25,310
It taps into this notion of cultness.

961
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,266
So if you consider that there's

962
00:46:28,298 --> 00:46:30,574
effective states that enable an

963
00:46:30,612 --> 00:46:33,054
individual to track and respond to

964
00:46:33,092 --> 00:46:35,518
discrepancies between self perception

965
00:46:35,694 --> 00:46:38,002
and social expectation through these

966
00:46:38,056 --> 00:46:40,754
effective states such as anxiety or

967
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:43,566
positive affect, we can see that there's

968
00:46:43,598 --> 00:46:46,410
a dynamic nature and self organization

969
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,210
of self esteem which is continually

970
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,430
shaped and reshaped by experiences and

971
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,462
interactions. And so under

972
00:46:55,516 --> 00:46:57,334
active inference. We can formalize this

973
00:46:57,372 --> 00:47:00,650
by saying that a model that is more

974
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,546
precise effectively captures the

975
00:47:03,568 --> 00:47:05,386
hierarchical structure of the moment to

976
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:08,294
moment variation of more stable traits,

977
00:47:08,342 --> 00:47:10,970
such as what we consider to be selfish.

978
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,966
And so basically we

979
00:47:15,988 --> 00:47:18,062
can see that identity and group

980
00:47:18,116 --> 00:47:20,330
membership here are fundamentally

981
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:24,386
related to the effective experience of

982
00:47:24,568 --> 00:47:26,994
being fit for the group membership. And

983
00:47:27,032 --> 00:47:29,794
so once you're there, you can grow in

984
00:47:29,832 --> 00:47:32,274
social cohesion and this will lead you

985
00:47:32,312 --> 00:47:35,314
to potentially try to maintain the

986
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,166
group. It will lead you to try to

987
00:47:38,268 --> 00:47:41,062
justify the beliefs of the group such

988
00:47:41,116 --> 00:47:43,714
that you have a form of confirmation

989
00:47:43,762 --> 00:47:46,406
bias, but also you maintain the

990
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:48,854
epistemic reality of this group, the

991
00:47:48,892 --> 00:47:51,114
symbolic reality of this group, which

992
00:47:51,152 --> 00:47:53,402
would be more costly to destroy than to

993
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:56,982
actually support. It's also integrated

994
00:47:57,046 --> 00:47:58,454
into your self esteem. Therefore,

995
00:47:58,502 --> 00:48:00,122
destroying the group would mean

996
00:48:00,176 --> 00:48:02,542
admitting that you are potentially not

997
00:48:02,596 --> 00:48:04,654
fit for the environment, that you are

998
00:48:04,772 --> 00:48:08,800
potentially some degree of wrong. And so

999
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,254
this leads us to the possibility that if

1000
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:14,286
someone has low self esteem, what do

1001
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,674
they do? They can either stay in this

1002
00:48:16,712 --> 00:48:19,186
group and accept that they are unfit for

1003
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:22,542
the group, and they would try to remove

1004
00:48:22,606 --> 00:48:24,514
themselves to some extent from the group

1005
00:48:24,552 --> 00:48:27,586
to avoid all that friction. Or they can

1006
00:48:27,608 --> 00:48:29,670
try to join a different group, one which

1007
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,998
will support your beliefs about the

1008
00:48:33,004 --> 00:48:34,982
world if your beliefs are too far from

1009
00:48:35,036 --> 00:48:36,646
where the group you're supposed to

1010
00:48:36,668 --> 00:48:38,906
belong to currently is. And this is

1011
00:48:38,928 --> 00:48:41,558
where we get to these subclusters

1012
00:48:41,654 --> 00:48:44,714
forming these little subgroups that

1013
00:48:44,752 --> 00:48:47,706
potentially can even become sometimes

1014
00:48:47,888 --> 00:48:49,562
violent and sometimes really not.

1015
00:48:49,616 --> 00:48:51,982
Sometimes it's just some tumblr group,

1016
00:48:52,036 --> 00:48:55,566
but it has power because it gives

1017
00:48:55,668 --> 00:48:57,582
the individual this feeling, this

1018
00:48:57,636 --> 00:49:00,974
valence of now being fit to a group that

1019
00:49:01,012 --> 00:49:02,400
supports their model.

1020
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:19,062
So I wanted to give a space to

1021
00:49:19,116 --> 00:49:22,360
talk. Yes, thank you.

1022
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:28,202
So I would like to go back a bit on

1023
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:32,310
what I said about individualism.

1024
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,234
So, yeah, I agree that I was

1025
00:49:36,272 --> 00:49:39,546
wrong about associating active

1026
00:49:39,578 --> 00:49:42,160
inference with individualism, because

1027
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,926
what is interesting here is that there

1028
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,746
is an individuality through active

1029
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:49,534
inference which emerge from the

1030
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:53,666
collective, and you can justify or

1031
00:49:53,768 --> 00:49:57,230
describe individual actions,

1032
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:00,674
or else through

1033
00:50:00,712 --> 00:50:03,638
the landscape, as you did just now, and

1034
00:50:03,724 --> 00:50:07,798
then go the other way around. So here

1035
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:10,822
we seem to grasp the interaction between

1036
00:50:10,876 --> 00:50:13,234
the individual and the group and vice

1037
00:50:13,282 --> 00:50:17,098
versa, which is what I found interesting

1038
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:17,820
here.

1039
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:26,106
Okay. Moreover, there is what

1040
00:50:26,128 --> 00:50:28,480
the individual adds to a group.

1041
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:32,442
I see that here. It seems to be captured

1042
00:50:32,506 --> 00:50:37,646
as we take the individual as how

1043
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:41,034
to say that a unique perspective.

1044
00:50:41,162 --> 00:50:44,340
This is what you said before now, that

1045
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,850
each person is a perspective,

1046
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:52,980
a unique one. And yeah,

1047
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,458
it's not all what I wanted to say.

1048
00:50:55,544 --> 00:50:59,334
Also, Lorena, you talked about the

1049
00:50:59,372 --> 00:51:03,558
beliefs that exist, and I think this is

1050
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,798
one interesting thing also in active

1051
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:09,450
inference. It's that we take belief as a

1052
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,874
material thing that influences us

1053
00:51:12,912 --> 00:51:15,754
and that we can also influence or create

1054
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:19,360
in a way even

1055
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,382
independently of if it's right, wrong or

1056
00:51:22,436 --> 00:51:26,334
whatever we judge it is like what

1057
00:51:26,372 --> 00:51:30,830
we talked about with the Moon sect and

1058
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,642
the Unification Church. So there are

1059
00:51:34,696 --> 00:51:36,466
people with crowns and we say that they

1060
00:51:36,488 --> 00:51:38,514
are the big boss and we have to deal

1061
00:51:38,552 --> 00:51:40,626
with it or to go away from the

1062
00:51:40,648 --> 00:51:44,774
landscape. From the landscape. And yeah,

1063
00:51:44,892 --> 00:51:46,822
it was like that in the social world,

1064
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:50,440
indifferently of if the person is really

1065
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:55,354
like the chief of the cults or not

1066
00:51:55,392 --> 00:51:57,002
because they said they were and people

1067
00:51:57,056 --> 00:51:59,066
were just following them. So in the end

1068
00:51:59,088 --> 00:52:03,706
it happened to create a landscape in

1069
00:52:03,728 --> 00:52:10,622
which one person is the

1070
00:52:10,676 --> 00:52:12,320
person who has power.

1071
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,126
I don't know what to say more about all

1072
00:52:16,148 --> 00:52:18,766
of this. I guess I agree with what you

1073
00:52:18,788 --> 00:52:20,000
said just before,

1074
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,070
that's it.

1075
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:38,422
So maybe we should move to challenges

1076
00:52:38,486 --> 00:52:41,290
and opportunities of active inference.

1077
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:47,454
So two

1078
00:52:47,492 --> 00:52:50,814
points, I think I just put them out

1079
00:52:50,852 --> 00:52:52,270
there. You can react.

1080
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,754
I think that one ActInf inference may

1081
00:52:56,792 --> 00:53:00,786
give us computational models or even

1082
00:53:00,968 --> 00:53:04,386
thorough grounded conceptual models of

1083
00:53:04,408 --> 00:53:06,760
social organization, specifically the

1084
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,240
semantic dimension to social life.

1085
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:15,222
And I also think that in its current

1086
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:17,110
formulation, within the Mikhail system

1087
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,182
theory, it is inept to represent parent

1088
00:53:20,236 --> 00:53:23,590
evolution because Mikhail system entail

1089
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,618
the formulation of a set of states that

1090
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,206
do not change through time and a mikol

1091
00:53:29,238 --> 00:53:31,378
flow that does not either change flu

1092
00:53:31,414 --> 00:53:34,846
time. So there are opportunities to

1093
00:53:34,868 --> 00:53:38,494
apply the model to the

1094
00:53:38,532 --> 00:53:41,390
framework to grounded,

1095
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,986
meaningful, semantically complete models

1096
00:53:45,018 --> 00:53:48,110
of revolution. But this model,

1097
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,826
if they are conformed evolution, they

1098
00:53:49,848 --> 00:53:52,510
will not really vibe well with the math

1099
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:56,142
that we invoke to say our computational

1100
00:53:56,206 --> 00:53:58,162
model are meaningful and that's like

1101
00:53:58,216 --> 00:54:00,440
rise and array of questions, I guess.

1102
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:04,198
So does anyone want to react to these

1103
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:05,350
two statements?

1104
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,176
Could I go sorry, could I make a

1105
00:54:37,198 --> 00:54:37,880
comment?

1106
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:44,216
More specifically, I'm interested in the

1107
00:54:44,238 --> 00:54:47,076
ways in which the ideas of active

1108
00:54:47,108 --> 00:54:49,164
inference impact on the way we think

1109
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,564
about society and the way society works.

1110
00:54:51,762 --> 00:54:54,444
And I can see from my reading and from

1111
00:54:54,482 --> 00:54:56,408
listening to the discussion that there's

1112
00:54:56,424 --> 00:54:58,676
a very rich due lexicon in vocabulary

1113
00:54:58,808 --> 00:55:01,600
set of concepts for the thinking within

1114
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:04,976
active inference thought. And as

1115
00:55:04,998 --> 00:55:06,908
we just commented, it's quite heavily

1116
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:09,440
mathematical. So the barrier to entry

1117
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,540
for the full active inference worldview,

1118
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,876
over time these ideas will permeate out

1119
00:55:19,898 --> 00:55:21,972
into the mainstream and they will change

1120
00:55:22,026 --> 00:55:24,232
the way people think and talk about

1121
00:55:24,286 --> 00:55:26,680
society. I'm interested in the ways

1122
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:29,256
people who've studied a bit more than I

1123
00:55:29,278 --> 00:55:31,464
have see potentially how this will

1124
00:55:31,502 --> 00:55:34,744
change the way society works or the way

1125
00:55:34,782 --> 00:55:38,156
that we have discussions or

1126
00:55:38,178 --> 00:55:41,372
envisage society more widely than just

1127
00:55:41,426 --> 00:55:43,310
an academic discussion. Obviously,

1128
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,270
maybe the questions are a bit too big.

1129
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,316
I think everyone is just waiting for the

1130
00:56:00,338 --> 00:56:03,150
other to talk first. Mao talked first.

1131
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,468
So I think I want to tackle a

1132
00:56:09,474 --> 00:56:14,236
little bit what you said about the

1133
00:56:14,258 --> 00:56:18,152
open ended nature, the open ended

1134
00:56:18,216 --> 00:56:21,956
evolution in of

1135
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,350
state spaces. Basically,

1136
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,460
I think under the path formulation,

1137
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,296
this open endedness is actually just a

1138
00:56:31,338 --> 00:56:34,730
perceived open endedness. It's just

1139
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,344
a function of the timescale being

1140
00:56:38,382 --> 00:56:41,512
considered and the motion along that

1141
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:42,440
timescale.

1142
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,124
I think we can go a little bit more into

1143
00:56:48,162 --> 00:56:51,468
depth about this. I think

1144
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,260
it's a very large topic.

1145
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,276
Effectively, if we go into quantum

1146
00:56:56,328 --> 00:56:59,776
formulations, there's some degree of

1147
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:01,776
irreducibility, and anything above that

1148
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:04,930
is historically contingent. So obviously

1149
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,384
some Markov blankets will dissolve and

1150
00:57:08,422 --> 00:57:10,276
reform and dissolve and reform. And

1151
00:57:10,298 --> 00:57:11,316
through this dissolution and

1152
00:57:11,338 --> 00:57:15,252
reformation, you get a new potential for

1153
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,860
mapping of observation to states. So

1154
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,700
there's always that possibility.

1155
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,864
But I think some challenges for

1156
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:29,192
active inference that are coming is,

1157
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:33,224
for instance, the complexity of

1158
00:57:33,262 --> 00:57:34,360
social behavior.

1159
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,156
We can extend active inference to

1160
00:57:40,178 --> 00:57:42,300
capture the nuances of social

1161
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:46,056
interactions. But effectively, active

1162
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:49,004
inference is about abductions. So it's

1163
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:51,250
the best guess for now.

1164
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,504
And it requires for us to put

1165
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:58,972
into the models what we think

1166
00:57:59,126 --> 00:58:02,244
are useful variables, what we think are

1167
00:58:02,282 --> 00:58:05,350
the right variables. And it's possible

1168
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,684
that we're always going to fall

1169
00:58:09,802 --> 00:58:13,188
just a little bit short. We can

1170
00:58:13,274 --> 00:58:15,716
either throw a bunch of data at a

1171
00:58:15,738 --> 00:58:17,144
problem and be like, well, okay, well,

1172
00:58:17,182 --> 00:58:20,776
just remove the noise, only pick up the

1173
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,392
signal, and figure out what's happening.

1174
00:58:22,446 --> 00:58:24,796
But that's no better than big data and

1175
00:58:24,818 --> 00:58:27,564
deep learning. So we have to figure out

1176
00:58:27,602 --> 00:58:31,404
a way to move forward and understand the

1177
00:58:31,442 --> 00:58:35,484
variables of interest and do this across

1178
00:58:35,682 --> 00:58:39,184
scales. So identify the priors that take

1179
00:58:39,222 --> 00:58:41,596
over at a given moment, but they won't

1180
00:58:41,628 --> 00:58:43,456
take over even if they're higher in the

1181
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,936
hierarchy at another moment, because in

1182
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:48,444
this hierarchy, you've actually switched

1183
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:51,076
states like you've moved. And this is

1184
00:58:51,098 --> 00:58:53,584
only predictable once you've understood

1185
00:58:53,632 --> 00:58:56,068
the effect of those priors. And you

1186
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,036
can't just consider that you have the

1187
00:58:58,058 --> 00:58:59,430
priors to begin with.

1188
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:06,036
So, yeah, as far as integration

1189
00:59:06,068 --> 00:59:08,008
with existing theories, I think we have

1190
00:59:08,014 --> 00:59:10,388
a nice opportunity ahead of us. It's

1191
00:59:10,404 --> 00:59:13,396
basically what you said, Colin.

1192
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:16,092
I think we're going to be able to more

1193
00:59:16,146 --> 00:59:19,276
and more, through the alignment of

1194
00:59:19,298 --> 00:59:21,244
certain kinds of language and the

1195
00:59:21,282 --> 00:59:25,016
formalism under that language, we're

1196
00:59:25,048 --> 00:59:27,132
going to be able to pull more and more

1197
00:59:27,186 --> 00:59:29,776
theories and find what's at the core of

1198
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:31,564
the connection between these theories.

1199
00:59:31,692 --> 00:59:33,276
Active inference is supposed to be scale

1200
00:59:33,308 --> 00:59:36,528
free, so it describes or it

1201
00:59:36,534 --> 00:59:39,156
is possible to help us describe the

1202
00:59:39,178 --> 00:59:43,888
phenomena basically from sociology

1203
00:59:43,984 --> 00:59:46,900
and literature to biology.

1204
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,412
So if we understand this, we understand

1205
00:59:49,466 --> 00:59:51,656
that there's a possible touch point, a

1206
00:59:51,678 --> 00:59:54,136
convergence of all these fields that are

1207
00:59:54,158 --> 00:59:57,304
tapping into the same ideas or into some

1208
00:59:57,342 --> 00:59:59,464
connecting points that allow us to

1209
00:59:59,502 --> 01:00:02,904
understand how we maybe do away

1210
01:00:03,102 --> 01:00:06,524
with these different fields, remove the

1211
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:08,764
silos, and come back together with

1212
01:00:08,802 --> 01:00:10,700
something that feels more integrative.

1213
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,676
But then again, we're back to the

1214
01:00:13,698 --> 01:00:15,324
computational limits, obviously. Like,

1215
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,224
if I want to compute the prediction for

1216
01:00:18,262 --> 01:00:20,496
an entire country, what is the

1217
01:00:20,518 --> 01:00:22,624
granularity level at which I should

1218
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:25,536
compute the right variables and if we

1219
01:00:25,558 --> 01:00:28,268
understand that individuals are formed

1220
01:00:28,284 --> 01:00:30,048
by the group, et cetera, do I just do a

1221
01:00:30,054 --> 01:00:32,380
mean field over the entire group? In

1222
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,228
which case am I losing out on some of

1223
01:00:34,234 --> 01:00:36,224
the variables that may actually impact

1224
01:00:36,272 --> 01:00:39,124
the outcomes? I think these are the key

1225
01:00:39,162 --> 01:00:41,236
questions that remain to be answered to

1226
01:00:41,258 --> 01:00:42,200
some extent.

1227
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,950
So I agree with what you said. Now.

1228
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,604
I agree that we can't represent

1229
01:00:57,652 --> 01:01:00,712
things and not somehow not cut anything

1230
01:01:00,766 --> 01:01:03,560
relevant to the thing when we model or

1231
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,504
we represent. The point of it is to have

1232
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:10,204
a more compressed way to engage with the

1233
01:01:10,242 --> 01:01:11,788
thing, with our knowledge of the thing,

1234
01:01:11,874 --> 01:01:14,172
than the actual thing. So we will just

1235
01:01:14,226 --> 01:01:17,244
cut information. That is the point of

1236
01:01:17,362 --> 01:01:21,084
modeling or representing. And maybe in

1237
01:01:21,122 --> 01:01:26,044
a very simple system such like just

1238
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,416
say perfect gas model in physics, there

1239
01:01:28,438 --> 01:01:30,556
is information we can cut and lose

1240
01:01:30,588 --> 01:01:33,744
nothing. We can cut information about

1241
01:01:33,782 --> 01:01:36,912
which particle is where, because the

1242
01:01:36,966 --> 01:01:39,116
different particles of the same atom as

1243
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:41,556
at this scale, the same properties. So

1244
01:01:41,578 --> 01:01:45,204
we don't really care what atom does

1245
01:01:45,242 --> 01:01:47,952
what. But in the case of human

1246
01:01:48,026 --> 01:01:50,584
societies, we have patterns of

1247
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:52,792
engagement and the specific information

1248
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:54,344
that is accessed by a specific agent is

1249
01:01:54,382 --> 01:01:57,144
important. And whatever we choose to cut

1250
01:01:57,182 --> 01:01:59,644
for a model, it will be relevant at some

1251
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:02,590
point. At least it will probably be if

1252
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,004
the information we cut is not

1253
01:02:07,042 --> 01:02:09,628
specific to a bunch of agent that will

1254
01:02:09,714 --> 01:02:12,940
die of car accidents or something. If

1255
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:14,656
any kind of information, any type of

1256
01:02:14,678 --> 01:02:16,288
information we may want to abstract out

1257
01:02:16,374 --> 01:02:17,904
will be relevant somewhere at some

1258
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,688
point. So yeah, we are dealing with

1259
01:02:20,774 --> 01:02:22,544
complex systems. We are not going to

1260
01:02:22,582 --> 01:02:26,288
model everything. But it

1261
01:02:26,294 --> 01:02:28,916
is a huge deal that active inference is

1262
01:02:28,938 --> 01:02:32,308
capable to fill in the semantic content

1263
01:02:32,474 --> 01:02:36,224
from dynamics, either from the

1264
01:02:36,282 --> 01:02:38,728
dynamics of component systems, say

1265
01:02:38,814 --> 01:02:41,492
neural dynamics and biological dynamics,

1266
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:45,464
or dynamics of a social context with the

1267
01:02:45,502 --> 01:02:48,490
modeling of axe inference agent as

1268
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,716
things that navigate the world and make

1269
01:02:50,738 --> 01:02:52,796
inference and stuff. And to my

1270
01:02:52,818 --> 01:02:54,364
knowledge, we do not have any other

1271
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:56,204
theory that makes the bridge between

1272
01:02:56,322 --> 01:02:59,900
just dynamics and semantics.

1273
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:04,604
We have other neurological cognitive

1274
01:03:04,652 --> 01:03:06,528
neuroscience people who talk about

1275
01:03:06,614 --> 01:03:09,570
dynamics a lot and how we can bring back

1276
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,856
the activity of cognitive systems to

1277
01:03:11,878 --> 01:03:15,344
dynamics. But usually it is in a way

1278
01:03:15,382 --> 01:03:18,036
that insists that we should just look at

1279
01:03:18,058 --> 01:03:19,636
the dynamics. We don't really need to

1280
01:03:19,658 --> 01:03:21,876
worry about the semantics or if we need

1281
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:23,604
to worry about the semantics, they

1282
01:03:23,642 --> 01:03:27,096
somehow reduce to the dynamics. The

1283
01:03:27,118 --> 01:03:29,320
dynamics is what exists and is important

1284
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:32,664
and what we should worry about. And so

1285
01:03:32,782 --> 01:03:35,290
another framework that is relevant to

1286
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,312
just study evolution of norms or

1287
01:03:38,366 --> 01:03:41,212
presentation or mental content in a

1288
01:03:41,266 --> 01:03:44,636
context, I cannot think of one, one that

1289
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:48,252
is thoroughly grounded at least that

1290
01:03:48,306 --> 01:03:51,036
attempts to thoroughly ground itself in

1291
01:03:51,058 --> 01:03:53,280
mathematics, mathematical physics,

1292
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,152
there isn't another one. And so that is

1293
01:03:57,206 --> 01:04:00,048
a huge deal. But there is a very

1294
01:04:00,134 --> 01:04:03,424
important problem, which is what I

1295
01:04:03,462 --> 01:04:04,636
said and you said, and we're grown,

1296
01:04:04,668 --> 01:04:08,304
which is that the periness in the

1297
01:04:08,342 --> 01:04:10,396
path integral formulation, in earlier

1298
01:04:10,428 --> 01:04:13,004
formulation in the FEP, it is illusory,

1299
01:04:13,052 --> 01:04:16,210
it is about like it.

1300
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:19,736
So maybe to give a bit of context, the

1301
01:04:19,758 --> 01:04:21,960
path integral formulation of the FEP is

1302
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:24,616
just when you do the FEP. So the bit of

1303
01:04:24,638 --> 01:04:28,344
math we make a huge deal about and

1304
01:04:28,382 --> 01:04:32,396
we apply it not to the dynamics of

1305
01:04:32,418 --> 01:04:35,016
a particle per se, like how it affects

1306
01:04:35,048 --> 01:04:37,644
the particle at point T, but how it

1307
01:04:37,682 --> 01:04:40,910
affects pathes of a particle for

1308
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,448
mathematic reasons. Reframing a problem

1309
01:04:44,534 --> 01:04:46,592
in path integral formulation is a huge

1310
01:04:46,646 --> 01:04:49,088
deal. It is what makes the difference

1311
01:04:49,174 --> 01:04:51,424
between a Newtonian, you push something

1312
01:04:51,462 --> 01:04:54,284
and it moves. And full fledged quantum

1313
01:04:54,332 --> 01:04:56,976
gorge theories that underwrite all of

1314
01:04:56,998 --> 01:05:00,556
contemporary physics. So yes, path

1315
01:05:00,588 --> 01:05:02,996
integral formulation is a huge deal.

1316
01:05:03,098 --> 01:05:05,444
But to write it, you still need to write

1317
01:05:05,482 --> 01:05:07,352
an emulator space, like to make the list

1318
01:05:07,406 --> 01:05:13,416
of all things that are possible. And if

1319
01:05:13,438 --> 01:05:16,264
you think that this is a correct model

1320
01:05:16,302 --> 01:05:18,168
of the world and a complete model of the

1321
01:05:18,174 --> 01:05:19,972
world, and this is everything there is,

1322
01:05:20,126 --> 01:05:23,356
you have to agree either that cause do

1323
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:26,556
not exist or that there is a place in

1324
01:05:26,578 --> 01:05:28,216
the primoldo wave function that existed

1325
01:05:28,248 --> 01:05:30,684
before universe did, before time did.

1326
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:34,190
There is a place where cones lies and

1327
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,576
I think cause exists and I do not think

1328
01:05:36,598 --> 01:05:38,396
cause are basic properties of quantum

1329
01:05:38,428 --> 01:05:40,848
mechanics. So cos must have happened

1330
01:05:40,934 --> 01:05:43,196
along the way somehow. And to represent

1331
01:05:43,228 --> 01:05:45,120
that mean to represent open endedness.

1332
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,816
So we need open endedness in math and

1333
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:50,884
the FEP is not one ended. And

1334
01:05:51,082 --> 01:05:52,980
structurally it's very hard to account

1335
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,764
for open ended evolution. And at a more

1336
01:05:55,802 --> 01:05:57,412
prosaic level, when we look at

1337
01:05:57,466 --> 01:05:59,636
engagement with social dynamics, with

1338
01:05:59,658 --> 01:06:01,204
the social world, we look at open

1339
01:06:01,242 --> 01:06:02,680
endedness because there is always

1340
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,192
integration of norms, there is always a

1341
01:06:05,326 --> 01:06:07,336
loss of information, but also that is

1342
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:09,544
constructive of new norms. There is no,

1343
01:06:09,582 --> 01:06:11,628
like, writing happen at some point. And

1344
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,128
then we did things differently, changed

1345
01:06:13,144 --> 01:06:15,064
the structure of cities, it enabled

1346
01:06:15,112 --> 01:06:17,500
administration to exist as a non trivial

1347
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:22,296
power society that actually mattered

1348
01:06:22,328 --> 01:06:25,344
its organization. And yeah, so new

1349
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:28,064
things happen. And if we want to look at

1350
01:06:28,102 --> 01:06:30,544
social engagement, it is critical to

1351
01:06:30,582 --> 01:06:32,384
look at how new things happen. And

1352
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:33,936
currently the FEP doesn't do that in

1353
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:36,484
active inference. I don't think it does

1354
01:06:36,522 --> 01:06:38,672
that. Maybe it can at a computational

1355
01:06:38,736 --> 01:06:42,208
level without grand from all pretension.

1356
01:06:42,304 --> 01:06:44,928
Maybe, but I did not see it. And that's

1357
01:06:44,944 --> 01:06:47,736
a big challenge that we have ahead of

1358
01:06:47,758 --> 01:06:49,944
us. And by we I mean everyone, not just

1359
01:06:49,982 --> 01:06:51,336
ActInf in front of people, everyone

1360
01:06:51,438 --> 01:06:53,290
should tackle that at some point.

1361
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,654
Daniel, you were raising your hand.

1362
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,290
I'll add just a few notes to Colin's

1363
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,014
question. Certainly it's something that

1364
01:07:08,052 --> 01:07:11,034
we all ask ourselves and many viewers

1365
01:07:11,082 --> 01:07:13,218
and participants in the ecosystem ask

1366
01:07:13,304 --> 01:07:16,866
like, so what then? What does it really

1367
01:07:16,968 --> 01:07:21,294
mean for active inference to be applied

1368
01:07:21,422 --> 01:07:24,338
to or by or in the social sciences. So I

1369
01:07:24,344 --> 01:07:25,858
think that's a big open question,

1370
01:07:25,944 --> 01:07:28,342
certainly one that's not only

1371
01:07:28,396 --> 01:07:30,214
addressable by one perspective or even

1372
01:07:30,252 --> 01:07:32,278
with words alone, but I think there's a

1373
01:07:32,284 --> 01:07:33,974
few key pieces especially that

1374
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:36,514
differentiate it from just the broader

1375
01:07:36,642 --> 01:07:39,606
or adjacent project of quantitative

1376
01:07:39,718 --> 01:07:42,342
social science or formal social science.

1377
01:07:42,486 --> 01:07:44,410
The question we should seek after is

1378
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,260
what does active inference bring in?

1379
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:50,986
And again, probably many ways to say it,

1380
01:07:51,008 --> 01:07:52,426
but we know for an active inference

1381
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:56,590
agent, as a scale free statement,

1382
01:07:57,730 --> 01:07:59,466
free energy can be bounded by changing

1383
01:07:59,498 --> 01:08:01,070
the world or changing the mind. So

1384
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,714
having continuity of social systems with

1385
01:08:03,752 --> 01:08:05,934
all other systems, spatial, temporal,

1386
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:09,122
arbitrary, material and so on, gives a

1387
01:08:09,176 --> 01:08:12,338
continuity and an interoperability that

1388
01:08:12,424 --> 01:08:14,922
without a scale free first principles

1389
01:08:15,086 --> 01:08:18,246
approach, is essentially not even on the

1390
01:08:18,268 --> 01:08:20,806
radar. So that's one massive piece. And

1391
01:08:20,828 --> 01:08:23,922
then I think where that begins to bear

1392
01:08:23,986 --> 01:08:27,550
or modify fruit is essentially

1393
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:30,326
the scientific and professional

1394
01:08:30,358 --> 01:08:32,806
development of cognitive engineering.

1395
01:08:32,998 --> 01:08:34,662
Understanding that the cognitive

1396
01:08:34,726 --> 01:08:37,066
constraints and scaffolds scripts, all

1397
01:08:37,088 --> 01:08:40,606
of these tasks implicitly and

1398
01:08:40,628 --> 01:08:43,006
then more recently, explicitly and most

1399
01:08:43,028 --> 01:08:45,310
recently quantitatively, informally,

1400
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:48,538
are examples of cognitive engineering.

1401
01:08:48,634 --> 01:08:51,246
So whether it's a stop sign and what

1402
01:08:51,268 --> 01:08:52,962
that comes to mean in different social

1403
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:56,030
locations or language as a complex

1404
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:58,786
phenomena, these are examples of

1405
01:08:58,808 --> 01:09:01,826
cognitive engineering in the same way

1406
01:09:01,848 --> 01:09:04,722
that building a stack of rocks is both

1407
01:09:04,776 --> 01:09:07,990
an example of material engineering and

1408
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,330
cognitive engineering through semiotics.

1409
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:14,646
And now when the scientific process,

1410
01:09:14,748 --> 01:09:18,362
the professional process, enters into

1411
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:22,278
this reflexive and relational posture

1412
01:09:22,454 --> 01:09:25,834
through active inference, that is

1413
01:09:25,872 --> 01:09:29,098
kind of a saddle point into a different

1414
01:09:29,264 --> 01:09:31,630
dynamic, I believe. Lorena.

1415
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,090
Lorena unmute and then go for it.

1416
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:46,776
Yeah, I just make one comment upon what

1417
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:50,136
is that? Keep in mind that active

1418
01:09:50,168 --> 01:09:52,508
inference can understand beliefs and

1419
01:09:52,594 --> 01:09:57,160
signs and this kind of semiotics

1420
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,500
as material and concrete because

1421
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:02,272
constraints, they constrain the

1422
01:10:02,326 --> 01:10:04,016
evolution of the system, like how the

1423
01:10:04,038 --> 01:10:06,064
system complexifies, right. And the

1424
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:09,810
constraints has this material effect

1425
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:13,410
on the dynamics. You cannot really

1426
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,884
believe that. Of course belief is

1427
01:10:17,002 --> 01:10:19,588
materialized as a table. Of course not.

1428
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,124
But for the system in terms of

1429
01:10:21,162 --> 01:10:22,916
constraining and understanding how

1430
01:10:22,938 --> 01:10:25,408
things scale up and how they complexify,

1431
01:10:25,584 --> 01:10:29,280
they have that kind of role.

1432
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,324
And that helps to understand a little

1433
01:10:32,362 --> 01:10:34,888
bit what Velvet was bringing about how

1434
01:10:35,054 --> 01:10:38,516
you can bring new values

1435
01:10:38,548 --> 01:10:41,724
and parameters for the dynamics that are

1436
01:10:41,762 --> 01:10:45,132
being described by the mathematics of

1437
01:10:45,266 --> 01:10:47,868
external and internal free energy

1438
01:10:47,954 --> 01:10:49,900
principle updating.

1439
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,810
And that is a way of tackling this

1440
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:58,944
novelty for this

1441
01:10:58,982 --> 01:11:01,056
kind of thinking over time. But you

1442
01:11:01,078 --> 01:11:04,244
don't have a proper account on how to

1443
01:11:04,282 --> 01:11:08,180
predict what is going to constrain

1444
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,910
the system next. Right?

1445
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:21,074
Yeah. Mao, go for it. And then we'll all

1446
01:11:21,272 --> 01:11:23,730
kind of give a closing round.

1447
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:25,010
Thoughts?

1448
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:30,226
Okay, well, there was a question in

1449
01:11:30,248 --> 01:11:33,446
the chat at one point. I just wanted to

1450
01:11:33,468 --> 01:11:35,686
potentially address the question if

1451
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:36,600
that's okay.

1452
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:41,766
So the question was, so would the

1453
01:11:41,788 --> 01:11:43,494
generative process of modeling the

1454
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:46,074
social system enclose multiple agents on

1455
01:11:46,112 --> 01:11:49,610
one Markov blanket or I assume inside

1456
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,546
or under one Markov blanket. So we

1457
01:11:53,568 --> 01:11:55,594
like to think of active inference as

1458
01:11:55,632 --> 01:11:57,846
nested in hierarchical. That's one thing

1459
01:11:57,888 --> 01:12:00,014
that Maxwell Ramstead definitely

1460
01:12:00,212 --> 01:12:04,254
pioneered, where each agent has its

1461
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:06,686
own mark of blankets, but there is a

1462
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:09,054
higher level Markov blanket that

1463
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:12,226
encloses the social system in play.

1464
01:12:12,408 --> 01:12:14,754
So individual agents can interact with

1465
01:12:14,792 --> 01:12:17,186
each other and the environment, but the

1466
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:21,326
social system as a whole also interacts

1467
01:12:21,358 --> 01:12:23,366
with the broader environment. And this

1468
01:12:23,388 --> 01:12:26,614
is where semantics and semiotics come

1469
01:12:26,652 --> 01:12:30,310
into play and the narratives around

1470
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:32,646
certain groups start shaping how they

1471
01:12:32,668 --> 01:12:35,426
can interact with the other groups which

1472
01:12:35,548 --> 01:12:37,494
have a perception of these narratives.

1473
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:39,482
So there's in group and out group

1474
01:12:39,536 --> 01:12:40,410
dynamics.

1475
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:45,222
So it's a little bit akin to how cells

1476
01:12:45,286 --> 01:12:47,034
within an organism have their own

1477
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:49,710
boundaries but are also part of a larger

1478
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:51,550
organism.

1479
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:56,638
So, yeah, I think that does that answer

1480
01:12:56,724 --> 01:12:58,910
the question from the person who asked?

1481
01:12:58,980 --> 01:12:59,600
That.

1482
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:07,598
Does. Nice. So perhaps

1483
01:13:07,774 --> 01:13:11,266
A and Colin, feel free to give in your

1484
01:13:11,288 --> 01:13:14,374
marks and then we'll pass around the

1485
01:13:14,572 --> 01:13:15,750
instructors.

1486
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,594
It can be as long or as short as you

1487
01:13:21,632 --> 01:13:24,940
like. Okay. May I go first?

1488
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:28,954
So I would

1489
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:32,442
like to say that the

1490
01:13:32,496 --> 01:13:36,010
key issue we are trying

1491
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:40,206
to grasp is that effective in France

1492
01:13:40,398 --> 01:13:43,134
has social and political implications

1493
01:13:43,262 --> 01:13:46,578
due to its scale free structure and

1494
01:13:46,664 --> 01:13:49,938
how we can apply it to the social world.

1495
01:13:50,104 --> 01:13:52,626
Then there is the self referential

1496
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:58,166
question that happens, which is what

1497
01:13:58,188 --> 01:14:01,894
is the structure of active inference as

1498
01:14:01,932 --> 01:14:04,166
a social construction itself and a

1499
01:14:04,188 --> 01:14:08,554
political construction itself? And what

1500
01:14:08,592 --> 01:14:12,170
are our own like,

1501
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:16,486
our own what is our own political

1502
01:14:16,598 --> 01:14:20,090
power and social power in this social

1503
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,722
and political world? And this is the

1504
01:14:23,856 --> 01:14:26,334
factor like thing that is going on

1505
01:14:26,452 --> 01:14:28,862
because afterwards, what is my own

1506
01:14:28,916 --> 01:14:30,594
social and political implication in this

1507
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:34,242
thing? And the more you get your own

1508
01:14:34,296 --> 01:14:36,798
agency and the agency of active

1509
01:14:36,814 --> 01:14:39,858
inference, the more it becomes like a

1510
01:14:39,864 --> 01:14:44,274
lot to process and the more you

1511
01:14:44,312 --> 01:14:49,654
grasp your own agency and

1512
01:14:49,692 --> 01:14:52,886
the power you have and the

1513
01:14:52,908 --> 01:14:56,634
responsibility you have. I guess

1514
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:57,946
this is one of the key points we are

1515
01:14:57,968 --> 01:15:01,180
trying to get here.

1516
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:07,274
Yeah, I guess that's the point I wanted

1517
01:15:07,312 --> 01:15:10,800
to make. And to finish with that,

1518
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:16,734
the game we are trying to play is to try

1519
01:15:16,772 --> 01:15:20,002
to found our own blind spots in this

1520
01:15:20,056 --> 01:15:23,026
game. Like what is the limit of the

1521
01:15:23,048 --> 01:15:26,946
model and does it have a

1522
01:15:26,968 --> 01:15:28,980
self referential limit or not?

1523
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:33,320
That's it.

1524
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:39,782
Yeah, I would endorse that

1525
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:44,040
and I feel the same way. I found that

1526
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:47,322
my reading just in the last year or so

1527
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,138
of active inference ideas, I found it

1528
01:15:50,144 --> 01:15:53,526
very empowering. The ideas of active

1529
01:15:53,558 --> 01:15:56,426
inference in relation to the individual

1530
01:15:56,528 --> 01:15:59,834
mind are quite well developed.

1531
01:15:59,882 --> 01:16:03,006
And it's very empowering to

1532
01:16:03,028 --> 01:16:05,406
be able to look at yourself through the

1533
01:16:05,428 --> 01:16:07,278
active inference paradigm and understand

1534
01:16:07,364 --> 01:16:09,918
the thought processes that is you. It's

1535
01:16:09,934 --> 01:16:13,458
a very empowering thing. And as I

1536
01:16:13,464 --> 01:16:15,634
was saying just recently, starting to

1537
01:16:15,672 --> 01:16:18,782
look at the idea that we can incorporate

1538
01:16:18,846 --> 01:16:21,394
an active inference concept of the way

1539
01:16:21,512 --> 01:16:23,494
the social world around us is

1540
01:16:23,532 --> 01:16:25,206
structured, which is part of that

1541
01:16:25,228 --> 01:16:28,914
paradigm too, I think is potentially

1542
01:16:28,962 --> 01:16:31,542
more empowering. But it's early days

1543
01:16:31,596 --> 01:16:36,326
yet, but I look forward very much to a

1544
01:16:36,348 --> 01:16:38,666
more developed world where people have

1545
01:16:38,688 --> 01:16:40,874
discussions with each other, not just

1546
01:16:40,912 --> 01:16:42,714
about what I'm thinking and how I think,

1547
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:45,114
but how I think about society and how we

1548
01:16:45,152 --> 01:16:47,458
think about society together. And it's

1549
01:16:47,494 --> 01:16:50,894
embedded within that paradigm. I feel

1550
01:16:50,932 --> 01:16:52,574
that's potentially something which is

1551
01:16:52,612 --> 01:16:54,974
very empowering and I look forward to

1552
01:16:55,012 --> 01:16:57,854
it. And thank the speakers all for their

1553
01:16:57,892 --> 01:17:00,530
contributions to this series of talks.

1554
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:06,970
Thank you, Colin. So,

1555
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:10,040
with the exception of Ben,

1556
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:13,636
whose lecture and contribution kicked

1557
01:17:13,668 --> 01:17:16,824
off this course and were excellent,

1558
01:17:16,872 --> 01:17:20,396
also we have the others of the

1559
01:17:20,418 --> 01:17:24,156
instructors here. So how

1560
01:17:24,338 --> 01:17:27,244
do each of you want to kind of conclude

1561
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:28,480
this chapter?

1562
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:38,350
Yeah. Mao, then. Lorena? Raphael?

1563
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:59,402
Yes. I think of

1564
01:17:59,456 --> 01:18:02,042
entities which are the capability of

1565
01:18:02,176 --> 01:18:05,274
interacting to maximize the information

1566
01:18:05,392 --> 01:18:07,574
they gather from the environment such

1567
01:18:07,632 --> 01:18:10,010
that as a whole, they can self evidence

1568
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:13,054
to maintain the phenotypes they believe

1569
01:18:13,092 --> 01:18:14,814
to be similar to their own. And

1570
01:18:14,852 --> 01:18:18,426
therefore themselves and how this leads

1571
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:22,402
to over time, the sedimentation of

1572
01:18:22,536 --> 01:18:26,158
norms and activities and eventually

1573
01:18:26,254 --> 01:18:27,986
the reference to these norms and

1574
01:18:28,008 --> 01:18:30,914
activities through the semantics and the

1575
01:18:30,952 --> 01:18:34,386
scripts. And effectively how this leads

1576
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:38,930
us to all the complexities of language

1577
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:42,102
and how we may now be at the point where

1578
01:18:42,156 --> 01:18:45,214
we have simulacra that represents

1579
01:18:45,282 --> 01:18:48,726
nothing, we just have these shells

1580
01:18:48,758 --> 01:18:51,146
of representations and these shells of

1581
01:18:51,168 --> 01:18:53,926
semantics which potentially have lost

1582
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:55,994
their anchoring in reality. So I think

1583
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:58,058
that was the through line of the course.

1584
01:18:58,144 --> 01:19:00,606
I hope we made a good case for it and

1585
01:19:00,628 --> 01:19:02,558
how active inference allows us to model

1586
01:19:02,644 --> 01:19:05,194
this entire path not only across scale,

1587
01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:07,566
but across time as well. So, yeah,

1588
01:19:07,588 --> 01:19:09,760
that's how I think I'm going to close.

1589
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:17,402
Yeah, I think this is me now. Yeah, I

1590
01:19:17,456 --> 01:19:20,026
really like the story as well that we

1591
01:19:20,048 --> 01:19:22,300
are building throughout the whole

1592
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:25,398
course, starting with a very general

1593
01:19:25,504 --> 01:19:27,694
idea of what is active inference with

1594
01:19:27,732 --> 01:19:31,550
Ben and then trying to build up

1595
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:35,486
this collective notion how

1596
01:19:35,508 --> 01:19:37,774
we contain information in a certain way

1597
01:19:37,812 --> 01:19:39,826
that it's always synchronized. So this

1598
01:19:39,848 --> 01:19:41,954
is always sort of meaningful that can be

1599
01:19:41,992 --> 01:19:44,818
described in certain ways by the

1600
01:19:44,824 --> 01:19:46,834
mathematics of active inference. And

1601
01:19:46,872 --> 01:19:49,106
then understanding these questions, the

1602
01:19:49,128 --> 01:19:50,594
hard questions that we're asking now,

1603
01:19:50,632 --> 01:19:53,054
like how we can bring new variables,

1604
01:19:53,102 --> 01:19:55,350
how can bring novelty into the system,

1605
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,126
which is something that we don't have an

1606
01:19:57,148 --> 01:19:59,974
answer yet. But I find that it's really

1607
01:20:00,012 --> 01:20:02,518
cool that we don't hold back in asking

1608
01:20:02,604 --> 01:20:04,842
that because I think that's the next

1609
01:20:04,896 --> 01:20:08,442
step for active, like understanding how

1610
01:20:08,496 --> 01:20:10,826
complexification comes about. How can we

1611
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:13,850
describe that? Yeah, and thanks,

1612
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,254
Avel and Daniel, for putting this

1613
01:20:16,292 --> 01:20:18,574
together. It was pretty cool and I hope

1614
01:20:18,612 --> 01:20:20,670
you guys also have enjoyed.

1615
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:26,110
Thank you, Lorena AFO.

1616
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:31,700
So thank you, Lorena. You're welcome.

1617
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:37,070
I think I put finger

1618
01:20:37,150 --> 01:20:41,586
on something quite deep as

1619
01:20:41,608 --> 01:20:44,774
usual, which is that if we want to have

1620
01:20:44,812 --> 01:20:48,422
a coherent theory of nature that is not

1621
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:51,014
based on just here are the things that

1622
01:20:51,052 --> 01:20:53,746
can be and we will draw dynamics on that

1623
01:20:53,868 --> 01:20:56,454
that is compatible with operating

1624
01:20:56,502 --> 01:20:58,874
evolution. We need to address self

1625
01:20:58,912 --> 01:21:00,620
referentiality, we need to address

1626
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:06,494
recursion and the possibility for

1627
01:21:06,532 --> 01:21:08,330
recursive individuation of physical

1628
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:11,802
beings. And that's tough and that's

1629
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:14,318
very tough because the basis of

1630
01:21:14,324 --> 01:21:17,486
representation is just I list array of

1631
01:21:17,508 --> 01:21:18,706
things I want to represent and I

1632
01:21:18,728 --> 01:21:22,306
represent that. But if things can just

1633
01:21:22,408 --> 01:21:24,914
happen that are new and that are by

1634
01:21:24,952 --> 01:21:26,258
definition not in the field of

1635
01:21:26,264 --> 01:21:29,346
possibilities that preexisted, then we

1636
01:21:29,368 --> 01:21:31,126
are fucked. There is no way we can

1637
01:21:31,148 --> 01:21:35,766
represent that. And there

1638
01:21:35,788 --> 01:21:39,474
is a family of approach in quantum

1639
01:21:39,522 --> 01:21:42,066
information theory that tries to tackle

1640
01:21:42,098 --> 01:21:47,274
that how to draw physics without being

1641
01:21:47,312 --> 01:21:51,082
rolling in a specific set space and just

1642
01:21:51,216 --> 01:21:54,122
I'd like to explain the history of that.

1643
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,938
So the math it draws from algebraic

1644
01:21:56,954 --> 01:22:00,094
topology, so we study surfaces, but not

1645
01:22:00,132 --> 01:22:01,786
by studying surfaces, by studying

1646
01:22:01,818 --> 01:22:03,850
transformation within those surfaces,

1647
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:06,686
but then we remove those surfaces and we

1648
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:09,282
keep only the transformation over what,

1649
01:22:09,336 --> 01:22:12,466
I don't know, but somehow we can, I

1650
01:22:12,488 --> 01:22:15,886
guess reconstruct coherent mathematical

1651
01:22:15,918 --> 01:22:18,962
entity from that. And I'd like us to

1652
01:22:19,016 --> 01:22:22,006
take a look at how this look, what the

1653
01:22:22,028 --> 01:22:25,334
math look like? So can we

1654
01:22:25,372 --> 01:22:28,806
see the screen? Okay, so this is the

1655
01:22:28,828 --> 01:22:31,318
structure of the quantum information

1656
01:22:31,484 --> 01:22:34,940
formulation of the FEP. These are

1657
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:38,666
dimension of interaction between system

1658
01:22:38,768 --> 01:22:42,454
A and system B. What defines

1659
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:44,314
the scope and the mode of this

1660
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:47,918
interaction? I don't know. And this is a

1661
01:22:48,004 --> 01:22:50,926
cocon diagram that represents an agent

1662
01:22:51,028 --> 01:22:53,886
together with the representation that he

1663
01:22:53,908 --> 01:22:57,294
develops. And I could tell you the

1664
01:22:57,332 --> 01:22:58,846
words that correspond to the thing

1665
01:22:58,868 --> 01:23:00,306
within this diagram, but I do not know

1666
01:23:00,328 --> 01:23:02,162
what they mean. So it would be a hard

1667
01:23:02,216 --> 01:23:05,582
thing to do. And the math

1668
01:23:05,646 --> 01:23:07,794
that is capable to tackle the self

1669
01:23:07,832 --> 01:23:11,062
versatility like maybe because I do not

1670
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:13,046
see any proof that it actually does. In

1671
01:23:13,068 --> 01:23:16,534
fact, it's not tractable for

1672
01:23:16,572 --> 01:23:18,658
humans and I exclude mathematical

1673
01:23:18,674 --> 01:23:22,054
physicists from humans there because of

1674
01:23:22,092 --> 01:23:24,074
the sheer abstractness of what is going

1675
01:23:24,112 --> 01:23:27,558
on and because of the lack of any abuse

1676
01:23:27,574 --> 01:23:30,202
reference that from anything we

1677
01:23:30,256 --> 01:23:34,314
intuitively understand in this. And the

1678
01:23:34,352 --> 01:23:36,734
work that we have to do if we want this

1679
01:23:36,772 --> 01:23:38,174
to move forward and to have a self

1680
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:41,454
coherent theory of social evolution is

1681
01:23:41,492 --> 01:23:44,954
to somehow entangle from that concrete

1682
01:23:45,002 --> 01:23:47,422
meaning things that apply to the world

1683
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:50,494
and conversely, use the way that we can

1684
01:23:50,532 --> 01:23:52,898
think of it as concrete interaction in

1685
01:23:52,904 --> 01:23:54,994
the world to further specify the

1686
01:23:55,032 --> 01:23:56,706
mathematics and prove that it is

1687
01:23:56,728 --> 01:23:58,386
actually self coherent and applies to

1688
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:02,022
stuff. And this is a big

1689
01:24:02,156 --> 01:24:05,830
work in fact and this is

1690
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:11,916
kind of exciting. I guess what

1691
01:24:11,938 --> 01:24:14,284
I wanted to say is ActInf in France is

1692
01:24:14,322 --> 01:24:16,380
dead. Long live active inference.

1693
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:24,780
Great. Well, it was a fun course,

1694
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:29,194
and this closing section and slide kind

1695
01:24:29,232 --> 01:24:31,974
of brought this unity between Chris

1696
01:24:32,022 --> 01:24:36,174
Fields's quantum work

1697
01:24:36,372 --> 01:24:38,686
and this social science, which in the

1698
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:41,342
disciplinary paradigm are seen as

1699
01:24:41,396 --> 01:24:43,614
distant or with different systems of

1700
01:24:43,652 --> 01:24:45,934
interest. And you can't get there from

1701
01:24:45,972 --> 01:24:48,274
here, but in a scale free first

1702
01:24:48,312 --> 01:24:50,786
principles paradigm. It's not even just

1703
01:24:50,808 --> 01:24:52,338
that we can hold them side by side,

1704
01:24:52,424 --> 01:24:56,562
it's that they are more than juxtaposed.

1705
01:24:56,706 --> 01:25:01,142
So it's been awesome and its own great

1706
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:03,110
experience to work with all of the

1707
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:06,818
instructors who shared their amazing

1708
01:25:07,004 --> 01:25:10,090
and youthful and energetic perspectives.

1709
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:14,794
And we explored new format in a new

1710
01:25:14,912 --> 01:25:18,618
way. We're going to process the

1711
01:25:18,704 --> 01:25:22,366
proceedings of the lectures and the

1712
01:25:22,388 --> 01:25:26,590
discussions, plus any

1713
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:29,626
final submitted question and answers

1714
01:25:29,818 --> 01:25:33,154
through the Syllabus website. Bring that

1715
01:25:33,192 --> 01:25:36,190
together into an open access publication

1716
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:38,594
of some kind. So for people who are

1717
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:41,154
interested in that kind of editorial or

1718
01:25:41,192 --> 01:25:43,566
curatorial work, the active inference

1719
01:25:43,598 --> 01:25:47,318
journal is for them. And then in 2024

1720
01:25:47,324 --> 01:25:51,026
and beyond, let's see where active

1721
01:25:51,058 --> 01:25:52,930
inference is, see where social sciences

1722
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:56,150
are, and hopefully,

1723
01:25:56,810 --> 01:26:00,806
as people are interested in Take it from

1724
01:26:00,828 --> 01:26:04,114
there. We threw in many fun ideas,

1725
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:08,422
but I guess we'll leave it till then

1726
01:26:08,476 --> 01:26:12,126
to find out. You all

1727
01:26:12,148 --> 01:26:13,840
right? Thank you, everybody.
