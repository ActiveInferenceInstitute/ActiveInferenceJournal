00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,306
Hello and welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:09,488 --> 00:00:10,422
This is physics.

3
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:14,806
As information processing Session 4 on communicating observers.

4
00:00:14,918 --> 00:00:17,740
It's the 10th of August 2023.

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,390
Chris looking forward to this lecture.

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,580
Off to you.

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,810
Thank you, Daniel, and welcome to this session.

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,734
As Daniel said, this is about communicating observers.

9
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:35,540
And fasten your seatbelts because we have a lot to cover in the next hour.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,170
So just to do a quick review.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:55,850
We've been talking about quantum information theory and we've been talking about it in the simplest possible setting of two systems, Alice and Bob, that exchange information through their mutual boundary.

12
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,118
And we've assumed that everything is finite dimensional.

13
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:05,130
So we don't need to worry about infinite energy transfer across this boundary.

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,682
And of course, we assume conservation of energy so there are no sources or sinks in either of the systems, Alice and Bob.

15
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:27,250
And we emphasize that this way of depicting things as topological we're not assuming any background geometry, no sort of spatial embedding which is going to become very important in this session.

16
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:42,706
In the last session, we talked about how the boundary, which I'll always call B can be thought of as a channel that comprises N qubits that are independent.

17
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:53,450
And Alice and Bob each can prepare and measure those qubits and they can always choose independently their reference frames for doing so.

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,070
So how they define up and down when they're measuring a spin with effectively a z-spin operator to interact with these qubits.

19
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,690
We talked a little bit about the free energy principle and its quantum formulation.

20
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:23,250
And the principle basically says that interacting systems will behave in a way that aligns their reference frames and that they therefore asymptotically approach entanglement.

21
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,906
So the FEP is a classical limit of the principle of unitarity.

22
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:41,100
And that's one reason for studying quantum information to learn more about the FEP and so to learn more about active inference and what the theory of active inference says about agents.

23
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:52,880
And last time, we talked a lot about the constraints that are imposed by a limited free energy supply on any agent.

24
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:11,626
Recall that we talked about the fact that in the absence of sources of free energy within an agent so as long as you conserve energy globally that the free energy that each agent uses has to come from its environment.

25
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,590
That's clearly true for us.

26
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,510
We have to consume oxygen and eat food and things like that to keep running as systems.

27
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:36,970
And we discussed a little bit this theorem that if two reference frames or quantum processes, Q1 and Q2 don't commute, they have to be implemented by compartments that communicate classically.

28
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,520
And we'll use this extensively today.

29
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:53,970
But the bottom line, last time, was that physics alone gives us compartmentalization in systems whenever the systems are complex enough to have multiple kinds of measurements that they can't deploy simultaneously.

30
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:14,470
So where we're going, today, we're going to start from this place we left off last time of the possibility of agents that are compartmentalized into compartments that have to communicate classically.

31
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:30,830
So we're going to talk about agents that can be compartmentalized into multiple subagents that share an environment, the environment consisting of Bob and how those agents talk about that shared environment.

32
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,000
So the motivation for this is simple.

33
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,250
It's that what we do all the time is a group activity.

34
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,470
And what we're doing right now is a group activity that involves sharing an environment such as what's shown on this screen and talking about it.

35
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:56,886
And the whole post session discussion process will be another example of just that sort of thing.

36
00:04:57,068 --> 00:05:13,130
So to talk about science at all or to talk about any kind of social relation or to talk about anything other than solipsism, we have to be able to talk about how multiple agents communicate about some shared environment.

37
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,000
And so that's what we're going to develop a formal way of talking about.

38
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,920
And there are two things to notice right off the top about this.

39
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:31,310
One is that the way we've defined interactions at boundaries, they're effectively instantaneous.

40
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:37,758
So each agent, remember, interacts with its boundary with some set of operators.

41
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:45,326
And what those operators do is effectively measure each operator--effectively measure the spin of a qubit.

42
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:47,940
So this is a very fast process.

43
00:05:50,390 --> 00:06:10,762
The other thing that we then need to notice is that if we have two agents and they're communicating with each other classically, then they're going to be using degrees of freedom of their shared environment in order to communicate.

44
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:13,278
And that's exactly what we're doing right now.

45
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:19,718
For example, we're using degrees of freedom of the internet to communicate.

46
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:31,140
I'm using degrees of freedom of the local atmosphere to talk to my microphone and I'm using degrees of freedom of the local photon field to see my screen.

47
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:43,122
So all communication between agents and certainly all classical communication between agents uses degrees of freedom of the environment.

48
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:50,090
And the environment, remember, is the other system, Bob, that's on the other side of that shared boundary.

49
00:06:50,750 --> 00:07:00,698
So we're going to be interested in how components of Alice use Bob as a communication channel and in fact, as multiple communication channels.

50
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:09,558
And I just wanted to quote my colleague and friend, Mike Levin, in his statement that all intelligence is composite.

51
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:29,270
All of us, all organisms, even single cells, are composite systems that comprise many many different agents that are able to make different kinds of measurements and execute different kinds of actions and so have to communicate classically.

52
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:38,780
So we're talking about all of life here as well as all of social systems and ecosystems and such things as that.

53
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:50,490
So the first thing I want to do today is simplify the notation so that we don't have to draw quite such complicated diagrams.

54
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,618
So the picture on the left here is a picture from the last session.

55
00:07:54,794 --> 00:08:10,900
It shows the structure of a very simple agent that makes some measurements using a reference frame called E and then writes some results of those measurements to memory using a reference frame called Y.

56
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:20,662
And those two processes are connected by an internal clock that ticks between the input process and the output process.

57
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:28,490
And the clock tick corresponds to the expenditure of free energy to write information irreversibly on the boundary.

58
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:35,478
So the memories are actually written on the boundary because that's where classical information lives in this theory.

59
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:50,930
So you can think of this whole process from E through the clock and back to Y as a single quantum process or as a quantum computation that maps some sector E of the boundary to some sector Y of the boundary.

60
00:08:51,590 --> 00:09:04,150
And so we can represent it in this much simpler way that's over on the right side as some process Q that maps some sector on the boundary to some other sector on the boundary.

61
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:11,030
And formally, that process can be thought of as a topological quantum field theory.

62
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,446
Topological here is important.

63
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:21,660
It's not geometric, it doesn't assume an embedding in space and this will become critically important later on.

64
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:33,790
And the operation of that TQFT [Topological Quantum Field Theory] requires a clock tick or it incorporates a tick of this internal clock.

65
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:52,530
And we can do this because we were able to prove--James Glazebrook and Antonino Marciano and I [(2022) Sequential measurements, topological quantum field theories, and topological quantum neural networks]--were able to prove last year that we can always represent a quantum reference frame as a topological quantum field theory.

66
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:59,526
And this just illustrates the two kinds of transformations between quantum reference frames that are important.

67
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:22,730
We can take one and divide it into two pieces that commute or we can take a two-part reference frame and we can swap in another part that doesn't commute with the part that we've swapped it in for but that does commute with the remainder of the reference frame.

68
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:37,394
So here R is the reference component of some object identification system and we can swap in some different way of looking at the object once we've identified it.

69
00:10:37,432 --> 00:11:01,690
So, for example, if the object that we're identifying is a box that can measure both Z spin and X spin, then P and Q can be the Z spin and X spin settings on that box that allow us to effectively rotate the filter from this way to that way so that we measure vertical spin versus horizontal spin.

70
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,562
And that's really it.

71
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:09,194
I mean, those are the ways that one can transform quantum reference frames.

72
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:27,810
Of course, we could do arbitrarily many compositions of this kind of transformation to do something very complicated, but they map very simply to TQFTs with the structure and you can construct categories out of this and find a functor that's well defined that maps one category to another.

73
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:38,390
So it's an example of a nice use of categorical techniques for solving a problem that looks difficult but in fact it's very straightforward.

74
00:11:39,370 --> 00:12:08,350
So using this simplified notation, it becomes very easy to see that if we have two systems, Alice and Bob on opposite sides of this boundary and we perfectly align their quantum reference frames, which is what the FEP says they will tend to do, then they become entangled.

75
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:19,940
And you can see that they're entangled by seeing that once the reference frames are perfectly aligned, they jointly implement one quantum process.

76
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,630
And jointly implementing one quantum process just means you're entangled.

77
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:33,640
The two sides no longer have conditionally independent states.

78
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:43,930
If one quantum process, which is time reversible, information preserving, is implemented jointly by the two systems.

79
00:12:44,510 --> 00:13:06,158
So a lot of things like this become very simple when we think of these processes as just quantum computations going on inside some system implemented by some system and how those processes relate across some boundary.

80
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:12,680
So that's what we're going to do for studying communication today.

81
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:32,454
Another thing to recall from a couple of sessions ago, our last session, is that if two reference frames, Q1 and Q2 commute, we can always join them together to form a single reference frame.

82
00:13:32,502 --> 00:13:38,560
And this is just a graphical depiction in this simpler language of how that works.

83
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:46,862
And topologically, there's no distinction between the left side and the right side.

84
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:54,210
What I've done is just squeeze the top two green circles together and the bottom two green circles together into one circle.

85
00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:00,594
And that just makes a simple process connecting the top one to the bottom one.

86
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:16,170
So what we're going to be interested in is situations where this doesn't happen, where Alice consists of two components that execute reference frames that don't commute.

87
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:22,822
And so the two components are conditionally independent.

88
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:26,410
They do each have free choice of reference frame.

89
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,074
And so they have to communicate classically.

90
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:37,070
They don't share a single quantum process, so they're not entangled.

91
00:14:38,130 --> 00:15:08,006
And before we go ahead to do that, I just wanted to remind you of some of the no-go theorems that follow from this situation depicted on the right, where we have a single agent executing a single reference frame, a single process, a single kind of measurement, any set of commuting measurements that can be combined into one measurement.

92
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,666
And here are some things Alice can't do.

93
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:13,450
And we've talked about some of these previously.

94
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,490
So this is basically a reminder.

95
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:27,626
But Alice can't, using just one measurement, measure the entanglement entropy across her own boundary.

96
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:31,442
So Alice can't know that she has an independent state.

97
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:35,598
She can't know that she's not entangled with Bob.

98
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:42,360
And that's a useful thing to think about philosophically as it applies to you and me.

99
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,360
We can't actually know that we have independent states.

100
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:57,530
Alice can't measure her own entanglement entropy, so she can't know whether she has components that have to communicate classically.

101
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:08,430
She can't measure Bob's entanglement entropy, so she can't know whether Bob has compartments that have to communicate classically.

102
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:18,670
And if you think in terms of perception theory, this says Alice can't know whether Bob consists of separate objects that behave classically.

103
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:33,190
Their behavior can look classical to her, but she's not able to determine that their behavior is classical because she can't measure Bob's entanglement entropy.

104
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:54,540
She can't measure the dimension of her own boundary and recall from a couple of times ago that the boundary includes some sector that supplies free energy that Alice can't extract information from for further processing, she can only extract free energy from.

105
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:03,360
So she can't measure the dimension of that sector, and so she can't measure the dimension of the whole boundary itself.

106
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,646
And this, of course, means that she can't measure her own dimension either.

107
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:16,382
And of course, she can't measure Bob's dimension, because the only information she can get about Bob is the classical information that's encoded on this boundary.

108
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:21,220
She can't reach past the boundary to see how large a system Bob is.

109
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:37,350
And that's clearly connected to this first point, that she can't measure the entanglement entropy across Bob, because the entanglement entropy can only be small if her dimension and Bob's dimension are both much larger than the dimension of the boundary.

110
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,740
So that's a condition she can't check.

111
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:46,330
So all of these kind of no-go theorems lead off in interesting directions.

112
00:17:46,690 --> 00:18:08,610
And the only one that we're really going to be interested in here is the third one, the one about measuring Bob's entanglement entropy, because we want to talk specifically about how multiple agents, so multiple components of Alice can access information about Bob's entanglement entropy.

113
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:21,290
Okay, so recall from the end of the last session that the last thing we talked about was classical communication.

114
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:31,920
And we talked about the fact that classical communication involves assumptions and pitfalls and that we have to be very careful whenever we talk about it.

115
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,178
And what we're going to do today is standard practice in physics.

116
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:47,390
We're simply going to stipulate that these components, A1 and A2, the separable components of Alice, communicate classically.

117
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,202
And so we're going to draw it like this.

118
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:55,330
We're going to draw a classical channel between them, and that classical channel passes through Bob.

119
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:09,610
It uses degrees of freedom of the ambient photon field or the ambient atmosphere or pieces of paper or email or something like that, that's out there in the environment to exchange classical messages.

120
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:14,394
And there are a couple of things to note here I haven't even written down here.

121
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:19,322
We're assuming that A1 and A2 share some language for this classical communication.

122
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:22,320
That's a big assumption, as we talked about last time.

123
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:28,398
But I will note explicitly that classical communication takes time.

124
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:31,554
That's what defines classicality here.

125
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:36,180
It's causal, so it can't work faster than the speed of light.

126
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,150
This is a topological theory.

127
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,102
We don't have any embedding geometry.

128
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:51,240
So we can't, at this point, talk about light, which is a relationship between space and time, because we've got time, we've got clocks, but we don't have any space.

129
00:19:51,930 --> 00:20:01,900
But we can say that whatever passes through this classical channel requires at least one clock tick on Bob's side.

130
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,330
So it's a process that Bob has to execute.

131
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,158
And executing that process takes time.

132
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:16,318
So getting the signal from me to you on the internet takes some time so the environment's clock has to tick during that.

133
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:41,686
And all of these assumptions bundled together turn out to be a fairly serious set of assumptions and they involve assumptions about fine tuning, about the universe being just right and they should make us nervous, and I just want to leave it at that.

134
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:47,142
We always assume with complete aplomb that agents can communicate classically but it's not a straightforward assumption--and it's worth--for any of you who are looking for interesting research projects, can look into the nature of classical communication.

135
00:20:58,506 --> 00:21:06,846
It's full of hidden assumptions and surprises and things that aren't at all straightforward even though they look like they ought to be.

136
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:08,590
So there's a challenge.

137
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,374
So why do we assume this?

138
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:13,758
Why do we assume classical communication?

139
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:18,930
We do it because we have to if we're going to talk about detecting entanglement.

140
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:27,666
And most of you probably know the history of the notion of entanglement.

141
00:21:27,778 --> 00:21:36,314
It was first noticed by [Albert] Einstein, [Boris] Podolski and [Nathan] Rosen--ever after called EPR [Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen]--in 1935.

142
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:49,390
And they wrote a paper which is infamous, and called the EPR paper, in which they argued that the phenomenon of entanglement made no sense and couldn't possibly be physical.

143
00:21:50,050 --> 00:22:00,100
And since quantum theory included this notion of entanglement, it couldn't possibly be a complete theory of what's going on in the world.

144
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:11,570
And Schrodinger replied the same year with a very detailed paper where he introduces, among other things, Schrodinger's cat as a paradox.

145
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:18,498
And he explains very clearly what entanglement is, and why entanglement follows from quantum theory.

146
00:22:18,674 --> 00:22:27,322
And he uses that discussion to argue that the classical notion of a physical state is not actually applicable to the world as it is, so he answers the EPR paper very directly.

147
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:53,810
And this discussion is currently mostly known as the Bohr-Einstein debate because of course [Niels] Bohr already in 1928 had said in print that the classical notion of causality in space and time simply doesn't apply anymore.

148
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,646
And Einstein objected to that vigorously.

149
00:22:57,838 --> 00:23:05,090
But that was 1935 and it was almost 50 years later that entanglement was first observed in the laboratory.

150
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:18,060
Here, the 1982 picture is a picture of the interior of Alain Aspect's laboratory when he performed the first entanglement experiment for which he finally won the Nobel Prize last year.

151
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:29,310
And these days this kind of experiment is done all over the world and is even done with satellite-borne sources.

152
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:48,440
Source is the key to quantum secured communication--as we'll discuss--in quantum cryptography and quantum banking and the quantum internet, all this other stuff that you may have heard of.

153
00:23:49,450 --> 00:24:00,570
So before talking more about these experiments, I just want to provide a definition of entanglement.

154
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,278
Entangled simply means not separable.

155
00:24:06,374 --> 00:24:07,850
That's the definition.

156
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:19,220
So a state, a joint state AB is entangled if and only if it does not factor into two separable states.

157
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,426
And that's it.

158
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:22,930
That's the definition.

159
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:44,540
And the literature, and especially the popular literature, is absolutely rife with hype and various kinds of mysterification of entanglement and authors trying to convince you that entanglement is this amazing kind of woo-woo thing.

160
00:24:45,310 --> 00:25:00,670
And whenever you run across that, go back to the definition. Entanglement simply means this simple mathematical condition of non-separability or a state that isn't factorizable.

161
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:06,346
And that means that the state does not display classical conditional independence.

162
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,074
So classically, that's the way to think about it; it's a failure of conditional independence.

163
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:19,650
And it's ubiquitous in quantum theory, even though it wasn't actually absurd for almost 50 years after it was predicted.

164
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,182
So here's what all these experiments look like.

165
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:35,406
They're called Bell EPR experiments, after John Bell, who derived the statistical criterion for detecting entanglement and EPR, Einstein, Podolski and Rosen, who did this as a thought experiment and said, if this occurs in the theory, it can't possibly be real.

166
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,900
And of course it is real.

167
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,390
It's now amply demonstrated by experimentation.

168
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,022
Here's how they work.

169
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:52,190
There's a source.

170
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:57,562
The source produces a state that is entangled.

171
00:25:57,706 --> 00:26:02,050
And I've written the typical what's called a Bell state.

172
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,906
It's up plus or minus down divided by the square root of two just to normalize it.

173
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:13,350
But up plus or minus down is clearly not the same as up times down.

174
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,720
So this is not a separable state.

175
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:26,886
And this state propagates outward in space and time to two observers who have independent laboratories, for example, on different continents.

176
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:42,830
In that space-based experiment that I showed you the picture of from the cover of Science a few years ago, 2017, I think, the two observers have freedom to choose their own reference frame, their own Z axis for measuring spin.

177
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,550
They do a spin measurement, and they do this over and over and over again.

178
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:57,598
They accumulate statistics and they exchange their results so that they can analyze the joint statistics of their experiment.

179
00:26:57,774 --> 00:27:03,938
And they check to see whether that joint statistics is consistent with classical probability theory.

180
00:27:04,114 --> 00:27:14,090
And if it isn't to a statistically significant level, then they've been able to detect entanglement.

181
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:20,086
Now, notice that this process requires classical communication.

182
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:33,550
They have to make their independent measurements in their own laboratories, and then they have to exchange results, or one of them has to send results to the other one, or they both have to send their results to some third party.

183
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,962
But in all of these cases, they're exchanging some classical data.

184
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:49,730
And so we have the assumption that whoever gets that classical data knows the language it was recorded in and so can do a joint analysis.

185
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:57,062
So I'll just show you another picture of this experiment that's in a standard space time diagram here.

186
00:27:57,116 --> 00:27:59,830
Time is vertical, space is horizontal.

187
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,970
The two observers are labeled Alice and Bob.

188
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,622
They share a quantum channel that goes from Alice to the source to Bob.

189
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:13,340
That's the entangled state.

190
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,082
They do some processing.

191
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:21,194
And then one of them here, Bob, sends the results to Alice.

192
00:28:21,322 --> 00:28:23,658
And that's a classical communication.

193
00:28:23,754 --> 00:28:27,600
It takes time, and it traverses space.

194
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,910
So this step is classical.

195
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:39,250
So this is why we have to assume classical communication to talk about detecting or using entanglement.

196
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,640
So now I want to represent this in a different way.

197
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,226
Using our little picture earlier, we're going to think of Alice, again as two components, a one and a two.

198
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,890
They're separable, so they have to communicate classically.

199
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:03,866
They have a classical channel that goes through Bob, and they also now share some quantum channel.

200
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:06,060
They share an entangled state.

201
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,642
And the entangled state, of course, is produced by Bob.

202
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,030
The source is part of Bob.

203
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:23,060
And their detectors, if you want to think about it that way, are located on this boundary B, or their interface with the sources on this boundary B.

204
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:34,760
And each of them executes a process that accumulates data from the quantum channel and communicates it to the other observer via the classical channel.

205
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,842
Now, this picture illustrates what's called a LOCC protocol.

206
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:44,250
LOCC means local operations and classical communication.

207
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:49,766
So A1 and A2 are each operating locally on their boundary.

208
00:29:49,878 --> 00:30:00,938
They're making measurements locally on their boundary, and they're communicating via actions locally on their boundary and observations locally on their boundary.

209
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:06,526
So, for example, I'm communicating with my computer here.

210
00:30:06,628 --> 00:30:08,958
We can consider it my boundary.

211
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:23,094
And stuff is happening in the environment that's implemented by the internet, and you're receiving those communications locally on your boundary, on your laptop or whatever it is you're using.

212
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:26,360
So that's what local operations means.

213
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,890
And these protocols specifically involve classical communication.

214
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,774
And so they're able to detect entanglement.

215
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:39,370
And a Bell/EPR experiment is just an example of a LOCC protocol.

216
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:45,974
The observers exchange information about how they're going to do their experiments.

217
00:30:46,022 --> 00:30:48,202
They're both going to measure D spin.

218
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:55,070
They're going to use independently chosen reference frames, and they're going to look at the output from some agreed upon source.

219
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,480
So that's all classically set up.

220
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:04,270
Then they actually make their observations, and then they classically communicate their results.

221
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:17,510
So classical communication, front and back LOCC protocols, are not limited to this sort of Bell/EPR sort of setting.

222
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:22,630
We can also represent a scattering experiment as a LOCC protocol.

223
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:29,718
So here's a representation of scattering as a LOCC protocol.

224
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:40,494
And you can see all I've done is cut that previous boundary at the division between A1 and A2.

225
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:54,290
And I've then extended it in some external time, the time that is counted by Bob's clock, not by Alice's clock.

226
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,250
That's what's meant by external.

227
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:03,718
And I've relabeled A2 as A1 at a later time.

228
00:32:03,804 --> 00:32:16,300
So now what Alice is doing is communicating with her past self, or A1 is communicating with her future self, and they're each doing something different.

229
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:24,490
A1 is executing a procedure that in the laboratory we call state preparation.

230
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:33,450
She's preparing a state that we'll call "in", which is just the initial state of some scattering experiment.

231
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:45,220
So, for example, at the LHC [Large Hadron Collider], "in" is some state of two protons that are portaling around the ring at the LHC at close to the speed of light.

232
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:55,494
And Alice, then later on at t plus delta t, is doing a different kind of quantum process.

233
00:32:55,612 --> 00:33:06,730
She's analyzing the data coming out of something like the ATLAS detector, which is a multiparticle counter that's located at the LHC.

234
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:17,120
So they share a quantum channel, which is the scattering channel that takes the incoming state and produces the outgoing state.

235
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:37,006
And recall from the very first session, as [Richard] Feynman told us, to understand this transition from "in" to "out", we have to integrate over all possible paths that are consistent with conservation of spin helicity, basically, momentum plus spin--all the different spins that are relevant in a high energy physics experiment, including things like lepton number, which is basically a spin.

236
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,858
Now, how do we know?

237
00:33:53,964 --> 00:33:56,330
How do we know what we have to conserve?

238
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:08,442
We know what we have to conserve because Alice is doing the experiment as a classical memory that allows her to remember what she prepared.

239
00:34:08,586 --> 00:34:24,770
She can remember that what she did back in the past was set to protons counterrotating in the LHC, and they had certain energies, and so they had certain momenta, and they were protons, so they had certain spin variables.

240
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:31,670
All of that has to be remembered to make any sense of the output of the detectors and so to actually come up with a measured state that makes sense.

241
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:47,078
And very often this memory channel is neglected by physicists.

242
00:34:47,174 --> 00:34:49,980
And I'm going to pause here and let Ander ask a question.

243
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,078
Thank you, Chris.

244
00:34:53,174 --> 00:35:02,682
So does this imply that every time you have a LOCC channel, the quantum part is a scattering picture, like a unitary evolution?

245
00:35:02,746 --> 00:35:09,970
Even in the earlier EPR picture, is that quantum channel portion always a unitary evolution scattering picture?

246
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,300
Thank you.

247
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:27,510
Yes, for essentially the reason that defined a classical channel, you're always assuming you have something that's protected from decoherence by the environment.

248
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:40,730
So, yeah, if you're doing an EPR experiment, you have to assume that you don't have any environmental decoherence between the source and the detectors.

249
00:35:41,630 --> 00:36:06,740
And similarly, when you're doing a scattering experiment, you have to make the assumption that the environment is not reaching in there and messing with the outgoing state that you're going to see, or reaching in and messing with the incoming state and changing it in some way that reprepares it in a way that you don't know, that you have no knowledge of.

250
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:15,640
So, yes, you're making a fairly strong anti-decoherence assumption in any of these settings when you're talking about having a quantum channel.

251
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,720
Does that answer the question?

252
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,014
Yes.

253
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:21,734
Thank you.

254
00:36:21,852 --> 00:36:22,920
Okay, great.

255
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:38,650
So we can think of LOCC, we can think of scattering as LOCC, and I just wanted to now emphasize that effectively what LOCC is implementing is two parallel memories.

256
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:49,330
A classical memory, which, as we said in the case of scattering, is memory for preparation.

257
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:59,940
In the EPR case, it's memory for preparation for what the experimental setup is, for what the instructions for doing the experiment are.

258
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:07,058
And we also have a quantum channel, which is effectively another memory.

259
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:10,280
It's something that's extended through time.

260
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:17,190
And again, it's implemented by the environment, implemented by Bob, and it involves Bob's clock ticking.

261
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:28,110
So whenever we have two memories in parallel, we can construct an error correcting code.

262
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,760
So think of a simple classical error correcting code.

263
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:38,026
For example, the use of parity bits in exchanging digital data.

264
00:37:38,148 --> 00:37:57,190
So if I send you a bit string classically, and I send it to you two or three times, so there's some redundancy in my signal and I send you a parity bit, I say, okay, add up your bit string, and the result should be one.

265
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,160
It's one on my side.

266
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:03,830
If you add it up and you get zero, there's an error someplace.

267
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,806
You can use that parity bit to detect errors.

268
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:20,666
So you can throw out the bit strings that you receive that have parity of zero and say, oh, the environment interfered somehow with the signal, or some eavesdropper interfered with the signal.

269
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,462
It made a mistake, or something like that.

270
00:38:22,516 --> 00:38:29,294
So this corresponds to environmental decoherence not being a good assumption.

271
00:38:29,422 --> 00:38:34,180
Even though it's classical, environmental interference is not a good assumption in this case.

272
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,666
So a quantum error correcting code is basically the same idea.

273
00:38:39,768 --> 00:38:53,690
I use some feature of the fact that I have two different memories and that I'm encoding something in time.

274
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:04,940
I'm encoding multiple replicates of something in time to provide a way of checking to make sure that I'm sending the correct message.

275
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:21,650
So I can, for example, consider the message to be my classical memory and consider the quantum process as a process that tests that memory.

276
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:27,300
So I remember that I need to do experiment X, and I will get result Y.

277
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:34,440
I actually do experiment X on this quantum channel and see if I get result Y.

278
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,320
And if I don't get result Y, then something's wrong.

279
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:49,450
Either I can't trust the quantum channel or I've remembered my preparation conditions incorrectly.

280
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:54,220
So I'm using one memory to check the accuracy of the other.

281
00:39:54,830 --> 00:40:11,378
And this using something about the environment, some channel in the environment to check memory is absolutely ubiquitous, and we use it all the time.

282
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:21,910
So, for example, look around your room, and your room hopefully looks more or less the same now that it did at the start of this session.

283
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,830
And that's very reassuring.

284
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:34,570
It reassures you that something's not happening in the environment that's dangerous and disturbing.

285
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:47,870
And if you couldn't do that, if your environment was constantly changing and there was no familiarity about the environment, you wouldn't be able to check your memory.

286
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,406
You wouldn't be able to check your sanity.

287
00:40:51,410 --> 00:41:00,494
So even though we don't think about our local environments as effectively an error correcting code, that's exactly how we use it.

288
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:10,180
We use stigmergic memory, or memory out there in the environment, as a way of checking our own memories and assuring that our memory is okay.

289
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,650
So I talked a little bit about quantum security.

290
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:21,064
Here's how quantum security system works again.

291
00:41:21,102 --> 00:41:22,520
It's a LOCC protocol.

292
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:38,720
We have some classical signal that can be thought of as a code or a key or a one-time pad, for example, that encodes a way of doing experiments.

293
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:47,890
And once that's been exchanged, assuming it's secure, then we can use the quantum channel to communicate information.

294
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:54,308
And the classical channel has told us what we have to do with that quantum channel.

295
00:41:54,394 --> 00:42:01,184
We have to make certain kinds of measurements at, say, particular clock times as measured.

296
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:09,000
And we'll get information sent from the past, from the sender.

297
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:30,130
And the classical channel protects the quantum channel from adversarial agents, because anything that an adversarial agent does to the quantum channel, if some agent tries to eavesdrop, for example, on the quantum channel, they'll disrupt the quantum channel and the results of our measurement will not be what's expected given the protocol that we run.

298
00:42:39,574 --> 00:42:51,380
So quantum communication is secured by the fact that interfering with some entangled state actually destroys the state so it's detectable.

299
00:42:52,040 --> 00:43:00,360
We can always know if someone is trying to disrupt our communications, which isn't true if we just have two classical channels.

300
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,468
Charlie can always intercept a message and then recreate it, and that's not possible with the quantum channel.

301
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:20,130
So let's refold this diagram so that we've taken the external time back out of it.

302
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:29,712
And we have this picture where the two components of Alice are just interacting via their shared boundary with their environment, Bob, and now we can see that the source of redundancy is not time, it's the boundary itself.

303
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:54,940
Just sharing the boundary allows Alice's components, A1 and A2, to put copies of the same information on different places on the boundary.

304
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,510
So the boundary now becomes a resource for redundant storage of information.

305
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:26,740
So Alice 1 and Alice 2 can use different parts of the boundary to check what other parts of the boundary say, to check the information that's encoded on other parts of the boundary, so they can define an error correcting code on the boundary itself using this LOCC protocol.

306
00:44:29,320 --> 00:45:10,710
So I just want to leave you with this idea that using classical and quantum channels together allows us to define error correcting codes on boundaries that we share as separate agents, and leave you to think about what shared measurements, what shared quantum reference frames, let us as agents see the same things.

307
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,580
And this is what we'll talk about next time in September.

308
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:41,980
We'll talk specifically about how space provides us with an error correcting code and try to understand why space is treated as emergent from something else, basically from communication in most of quantum gravity.

309
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,270
So thank you very much.

310
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:52,716
I encourage you to use the interactive QA and to attend the discussion sessions, and we'll see you in September.

311
00:45:52,908 --> 00:45:53,890
Thank you.

312
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,690
Awesome.

313
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,780
Chris, thank you for the lecture.

314
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,950
Andrew, do you have any remarks or questions?

315
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,750
Not right now, thank you.

316
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:18,116
I'll just ask a few quick questions and if anyone has one, quickly in the live chat.

317
00:46:18,228 --> 00:46:29,224
So you mentioned the tick of the clock, and in active inference, we often hold up side by side both the discrete time models and the continuous time models.

318
00:46:29,272 --> 00:46:36,460
So do clocks have to tick discreetly or how do we think about continuous time modeling.

319
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,036
In this quantum setting they do have to tick discreetly because one has to be able to distinguish Alice's preparation of the qubits on her boundary from Bob's measurements of the qubits on the boundary.

320
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:07,130
And this process can be extremely fast with respect to any kind of sense of macroscopic time.

321
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:16,060
Your eyes are responding to photons in, I think it's hundreds of femtoseconds.

322
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:33,760
So the discrete transitions that are effectively time measurements for you are at that very fast molecular timescale, much, much faster than our typical clocks.

323
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:45,860
Now, when we try to do very fast timing, we're constructing a faster clock than that, but it's a clock that we can only observe indirectly.

324
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,292
Awesome.

325
00:47:51,426 --> 00:47:51,916
Okay.

326
00:47:52,018 --> 00:48:12,390
Now this one maybe connects a little bit to application, but with all the developments happening in theory, some of which you're reviewing here and also in practice with quantum computation, and then keeping in mind this distinction sorry, I've lost you back.

327
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,936
I've lost you, Daniel.

328
00:48:19,048 --> 00:48:21,388
Okay, we'll wait till you're back.

329
00:48:21,554 --> 00:48:22,460
I can see you.

330
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:22,908
No.

331
00:48:22,994 --> 00:48:23,724
Okay.

332
00:48:23,922 --> 00:48:24,364
All right.

333
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,340
Just repeat.

334
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:26,972
Yeah.

335
00:48:27,026 --> 00:48:57,210
So given these rapid and ongoing developments in theory and practice related to quantum information science and quantum information security, how are people using this distinction of the classical stigmergic memory and then the quantum cognitive process to anticipate how to develop information systems that are reliable going forward?

336
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:14,880
I don't know of any instances in which thinking about quantum cognition has entered directly into any design of communication systems.

337
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:21,360
The ability of humans to interact with these systems is just assumed.

338
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:36,928
So it's just assumed that the user can interact with, say, a computer interface, which is the sort of interface that will be provided or is provided to any quantum computer.

339
00:49:37,114 --> 00:49:45,770
So if you think about a quantum computer, a practical quantum computer, it has classical interfaces, front and back.

340
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:59,196
So in thinking about interacting with the computer, I'm giving it some classical problem statement, for example, and asking for some classical answer.

341
00:49:59,298 --> 00:50:03,520
And what it's going to give me is a probability distribution of classical answers.

342
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:11,520
But I can, by running the calculation many times, make that probability distribution fairly tight.

343
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:20,340
Yeah, I don't know of anyone talking about quantum BCIs [Brain-Computer Interfaces] at this point.

344
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,900
It'd be an interesting question.

345
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:36,450
Was it always understood, these sorts of blind spots and axioms associated with classical communication, was it developed as kind of like a proposal or like a special case and more unpacking was left for later?

346
00:50:46,928 --> 00:50:50,730
Or are these blind spots things that we're now coming into awareness of?

347
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,170
Given what we're learning in the quantum information sciences?

348
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:58,560
I think we're learning how serious they are.

349
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:04,720
But they were certainly recognized even by [Niels] Bohr in his 1928 paper [1928, The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory, https://www.nature.com/articles/121580a0].

350
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:10,050
And that's a very good paper, too.

351
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,194
It's called the present state of quantum theory or something like that.

352
00:51:14,232 --> 00:51:19,410
And it's in Nature, and it's available on the web somewhere.

353
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,760
I have a copy of it.

354
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:38,010
But it was written, in a sense, as Bohr's summary of the 1927 Solvay Conference [Fifth Solvay Conference, Oct 24-29, 1927], which was the conference at which everyone doing quantum theory at that time got together to talk about their results.

355
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:56,566
And in it, [Niels] Bohr essentially presents what came to be the Copenhagen interpretation, which I think is probably unfairly called an interpretation.

356
00:51:56,698 --> 00:52:02,850
It's sort of the Copenhagen pragmatic stance toward quantum theory.

357
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:17,320
And essentially what Bohr says is that if we're going to do science, we have to assume that people can talk to each other.

358
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:32,010
And if we're going to do science, we have to assume that there are instruments that we can manipulate and have reasonable confidence that we know what manipulation we've done.

359
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:41,200
So if I turn a knob from one to two, I have to be reasonably confident that I'm making a particular change that I can understand.

360
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:51,170
And we have to have reasonable confidence that different laboratories can replicate the same experiment.

361
00:52:52,390 --> 00:53:01,560
And if we think about any of those assumptions in purely quantum theoretic terms, then all sorts of questions are raised, right?

362
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,178
Every quantum system is unique.

363
00:53:04,354 --> 00:53:08,870
We have the no-cloning theorem, so every scientific instrument is unique.

364
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:14,934
So there's no such thing as exactly replicating an experiment.

365
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:15,740
Right?

366
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:22,460
That's a coarse-grained description of what I've done with a completely unique quantum system.

367
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:27,646
And my brain, of course, is unique, and yours is too.

368
00:53:27,668 --> 00:53:29,360
And everyone else's is.

369
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:37,070
So talking about us sharing a language is essentially a coarse-grained assumption.

370
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:45,710
And what the Copenhagen stance is all about is coarse-graining yielding effective classicality.

371
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:54,840
Or what that really means is coarse-graining yielding a description that we can use in the language that we understand?

372
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:12,250
So these are very, very old issues that have been recognized for a long time, but I think in part because of the disaster of "shut up and calculate", they haven't really been talked about in the classroom.

373
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:15,546
Awesome.

374
00:54:15,648 --> 00:54:18,270
I'll just read short questions from the chat.

375
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:24,190
We can pass them to the discussion section, but there's a lot of great diverse questions.

376
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,680
So Alexi wrote, I think I've lost you again.

377
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,318
The revenge of zoom.

378
00:54:30,494 --> 00:54:37,570
Well, we looked at the chart earlier where, like, Bob was talking to Alice, the unidirectional communication.

379
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:41,570
Okay, okay.

380
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,978
The unidirectional...

381
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:45,640
The third party is recording it, I'm sure.

382
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:58,038
Alexi wrote, regarding the environment being used for error correction, a symptom of derealization in psychological trauma breakdown, we don't recognize the environment around us and it's scary.

383
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:05,340
Makes sense.

384
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:06,750
Makes sense.

385
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,566
All right.

386
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:08,778
From Bala.

387
00:55:08,874 --> 00:55:09,802
Nice presentation.

388
00:55:09,866 --> 00:55:15,994
I heard Chris say entangled states are LOCC for a specific reference frame.

389
00:55:16,122 --> 00:55:21,730
Is this entanglement unitary or is it related to the numbers of degrees of freedom?

390
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,270
I think the quick answer would be both.

391
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:39,720
If you have a complex system with many degrees of freedom, some can be entangled while others aren't.

392
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,500
It depends on what parts of the state are separable.

393
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:57,500
So again, entanglement is just a statement about components of a joint state that factor or don't.

394
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:08,000
So you can have a joint state that looks separable along some dimensions, but... [inaudible] ...in other dimensions.

395
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:17,190
The other big complication here is that whether a state looks entangled depends on the reference frames that you use to measure it with.

396
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:28,896
And if you pick entangled reference frames, then what we ordinarily think of as separable entangled states become separable.

397
00:56:29,088 --> 00:56:31,270
So you can move entanglement around.

398
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,524
Awesome.

399
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:51,360
Okay, from Roland Rodriguez--is the discrete temporality only within the context of a given holographic screen interface, with time being bracketed otherwise beyond interface systems, is continuity or discretization kept agnostic?

400
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,650
I think if I understand the question correctly, it's yes.

401
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:14,280
If I don't draw any boundaries, I just have the joint state, then the evolution is unitary and in a sense time plays no role.

402
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:23,720
And if unitary evolution is perfectly time symmetric, so time actually drops out altogether.

403
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,204
Awesome.

404
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,780
So to talk about time, we have to draw boundaries.

405
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:29,740
Awesome.

406
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:32,620
Time must "have a stop", Huxley.

407
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:46,604
And I'll ask one last question from the appropriately "monikered question quanderer"--all communication is abductive is a sentiment that I've been using to develop some arguments.

408
00:57:46,652 --> 00:57:48,210
Does that scan for you?

409
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:54,260
How do we connect what we're discussing here with quantum to abductive logic?

410
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:02,792
Yeah, I could go along with that.

411
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,330
I'd want a lot more detail.

412
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:10,564
All communication is essentially analogical.

413
00:58:10,692 --> 00:58:11,752
I would agree with that.

414
00:58:11,806 --> 00:58:12,410
Yes.

415
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,840
Andrew?

416
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:17,852
Yes.

417
00:58:17,906 --> 00:58:18,670
Thank you.

418
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,500
So going back to the picture where the scattering picture.

419
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:32,716
So we have so far, everything is topological, and certainly induces breaking the boundary in different sectors.

420
00:58:32,748 --> 00:58:36,396
I suppose it induces a topology on the boundary.

421
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:41,590
Now, I had a couple of questions as for the geometry, and this might be getting ahead.

422
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:49,104
Is it an emergent property of those channels between different boundary sectors?

423
00:58:49,232 --> 00:58:53,850
And if that's the case, then what does it mean to have a QRF or space?

424
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:08,750
Yeah, this is really the topic for September, but you do point out the fact that it's something of a chicken and egg situation.

425
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:30,980
The way I think of it is, I suppose to choose the chicken side and think about what kind of reference frame does the agent have to implement to see space on their boundary.

426
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,468
And the reason I think about it that way is that's a question I want to be able to ask about biological systems.

427
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:44,760
And this actually gets into probably what won't be talked about until October.

428
00:59:45,420 --> 01:00:10,560
But I want to be able to ask essentially a phylogenetic question of what sorts of organisms, where in the lineage from LUCA, do we find systems that are able to assign spatial coordinates to their boundaries and what coordinates come first?

429
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:47,630
1: And I suspect that sort of discrete location names with no metric come first that a system can talk about, for example, this part of their membrane versus that part of their membrane without even having any ability to say, how far apart they are and that some sort of metric representation of this angular space comes later and that a radial space comes even later than that.

430
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,928
That's, at this point, speculation.

431
01:00:50,024 --> 01:01:02,400
But I think these are questions that we can end up asking given the right kind of formalism and the right understanding of what it means to be able to make a spatial measurement.

432
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:10,452
So the conjecture is that the metric would emerge from a discrete network metric of counting ticks sort of thing.

433
01:01:10,506 --> 01:01:13,236
Yeah, I think that's correct.

434
01:01:13,338 --> 01:01:22,396
1: And the sort of symmetries of space that we see are very much tied up with object identity.

435
01:01:22,528 --> 01:01:36,080
So if we think about something like rotational symmetry let's see, I should stop screen sharing.

436
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:47,300
1: So I've got this object, right, and I can do this, and I say, oh, space has this rotational symmetry.

437
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:52,744
But for me to say that, I have to recognize that this is the same object, right?

438
01:01:52,862 --> 01:02:00,010
I have to implement object persistence, which we all learn to do when we're nine months old or something.

439
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:22,480
But we tend to regard those as separate things as we learn object persistence, because space is rotationally symmetric, but we can view it the other way around, that space is rotationally symmetric for me because I implement these constraints that are called object persistence.

440
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:41,240
Do you think we can understand phylogenetics as a whole, as a kind of scattering experiment, like the high energy LUCA event and then dissipating and propagating in a very tangled bank?

441
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:53,388
Well, I do want to be able to understand phylogeny in exactly the same terms as embryology, and Mike Levin and I have published papers about that.

442
01:02:53,474 --> 01:03:02,030
We should be able to view the lineage of LUCA in exactly the same way that we view the lineage of the zygote that produced us.

443
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:15,330
So that's why it's no coincidence that during pregnancy, the development of the embryo mirrors evolution in terms of the parts that are developed first.

444
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:30,810
Yeah, this is the old idea that phylogeny and ontogeny are related in some way, which, from an embryonic development point of view, they're certainly analogous in ways.

445
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:39,700
Sorry, if I may ask one last question--should be very quick--regarding the weak rotation.

446
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:48,590
I'm still a bit unsure how it ties to this diagrammatic notation that we had with quantum channels on show so on.

447
01:03:51,760 --> 01:04:00,240
1: In the second session, we briefly talked about the weak rotation being a reversal in the direction of time.

448
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:02,960
Is there any relation to today's session?

449
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:22,388
Yeah, whenever we think about the flow of time as driven by the input-output cycle, the input-output cycle for agents separated by a boundary, there's always a sign change.

450
01:04:29,182 --> 01:04:29,560
Right.

451
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:32,460
My input is your output, and vice versa.

452
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:59,540
So when we think about Bob's clock ticking, when Alice does something, his direction of time, in a sense, points with respect to the boundary opposite to hers, but that's only with respect to the boundary.

453
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:05,270
1: He sees information flowing in, and she sees information flowing in.

454
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:12,980
1: That's the only point being made here about the Wick rotation as an operation.

455
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:15,590
Thank you.

456
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,940
Thank you, Chris.

457
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,668
Very well appreciated by the viewers and by us.

458
01:05:22,754 --> 01:05:35,112
1: So we'll certainly look forward to reviewing the Q&A, and everybody is welcome and encouraged to join for the participatory discussion in about two weeks on Saturday.

459
01:05:35,256 --> 01:05:38,270
So till next time.

460
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,300
All right, thank you.

461
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:40,680
Cheers.
