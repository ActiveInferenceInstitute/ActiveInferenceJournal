00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,026
Hello and

2
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:10,666
welcome, everyone. This is physics as

3
00:00:10,688 --> 00:00:13,322
information processing, session four on

4
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:15,978
communicating observers. It's the 10

5
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:19,402
August 2023. Chris looking forward

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,580
to this lecture. Off to you.

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,074
Thank you, Daniel, and welcome to this

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,898
session. As Daniel said, this is about

9
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:31,726
out communicating observers. And fasten

10
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:33,746
your seatbelts because we have a lot to

11
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:35,540
cover in the next hour.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,954
So just to do a quick review. We've been

13
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:43,410
talking about quantum information theory

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,574
and we've been talking about it in the

15
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:49,878
simplest possible setting of two

16
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:53,138
systems, Alice and Bob, that exchange

17
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:54,950
information through their mutual

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,674
boundary. And we've assumed that

19
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:00,586
everything is finite dimensional. So we

20
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:02,582
don't need to worry about infinite

21
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,130
energy transfer across this boundary.

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,046
And of course, we assume conservation of

23
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,750
energy so there are no sources or sinks

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,058
in either of the systems. Alice and Bob

25
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:17,440
and we emphasize that this way of

26
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,158
depicting things as topological we're

27
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:22,430
not assuming any background geometry,

28
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,866
no sort of spatial embedding which is

29
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:26,514
going to become very important in this

30
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:30,226
session. In the

31
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:33,430
last session, we talked about how the

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,046
boundary, which I'll always call B can

33
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:39,302
be thought of as a channel that

34
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:42,706
comprises N qubits that are independent.

35
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:46,522
And Alice and Bob each can prepare and

36
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:49,738
measure those qubits and they can always

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,102
choose independently their reference

38
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,742
frames for doing so. So how they define

39
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:57,134
up and down when they're measuring a

40
00:01:57,172 --> 00:02:01,070
spin with effectively a Zspin operator.

41
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,430
To interact with these qubits.

42
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,694
We talked a little bit about the free

43
00:02:07,732 --> 00:02:09,582
energy principle and its quantum

44
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:13,186
formulation. And the principle basically

45
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:15,794
says that interacting systems will

46
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:17,506
behave in a way that aligns their

47
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:20,910
reference frames and that they therefore

48
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,250
asymptotically approach entanglement.

49
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,214
So the FEP is a classical limit of the

50
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:28,934
principle of unitarity. And that's one

51
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:31,382
reason for studying quantum information

52
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:34,874
to learn more about the FEP and

53
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:37,238
so to learn more about active inference

54
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:39,542
and what the theory of active inference

55
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:41,100
says about agents.

56
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,790
And last time, we talked a lot about the

57
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,806
constraints that are imposed by a

58
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:52,880
limited free energy supply on any agent.

59
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,270
Recall that we talked about the fact

60
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,906
that in the absence of sources of free

61
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:02,130
energy within

62
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,406
an agent so as long as you conserve

63
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:08,050
energy globally that the free energy

64
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,594
that each agent uses has to come from

65
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:13,254
its environment. That's clearly true for

66
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:16,214
us. We have to consume oxygen and eat

67
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:17,942
food and things like that to keep

68
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:21,874
running as systems. And we discussed

69
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:26,140
a little bit this theorem that if two

70
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,430
reference frames or quantum processes,

71
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,410
q One and Q Two don't commute,

72
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,666
they have to be implemented by

73
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:36,354
compartments that communicate

74
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:37,982
classically. And we'll use this

75
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:41,502
extensively today. But the bottom line

76
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:43,774
last time was that physics alone gives

77
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:46,074
us compartmentalization in systems

78
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:48,222
whenever the systems are complex enough

79
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:51,310
to have multiple kinds of measurements

80
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,970
that they can't deploy simultaneously.

81
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,570
So where we're going today,

82
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,702
we're going to start from this place

83
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:06,866
we left off last time of the possibility

84
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:11,254
of agents that are compartmentalized and

85
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:12,966
into compartments that have to

86
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:15,786
communicate classically. So we're going

87
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,882
to talk about agents that can be

88
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:20,022
compartmentalized into multiple

89
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:22,950
subagents that share an environment,

90
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,742
the environment consisting of Bob and

91
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:29,946
how those agents talk about that shared

92
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,054
environment. So the motivation for this

93
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:36,494
is simple. It's that what we do all the

94
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:38,950
time is a group activity. And what we're

95
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,234
doing right now is a group activity that

96
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:43,886
involves sharing an environment. What's

97
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,434
shown on this screen and talking about

98
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:50,450
it. And the whole post

99
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,054
session discussion process will be

100
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:56,214
another example of just that sort of

101
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:59,686
thing. So to talk about science at

102
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,230
all or to talk about any kind of social

103
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,330
relations or to talk about anything

104
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,386
other than solipsism, we have to be able

105
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,930
to talk about how multiple agents

106
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,246
communicate about some shared

107
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,838
environment. And so that's what we're

108
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:17,342
going to develop a formal way of talking

109
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:20,334
about. And there are two things to

110
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:23,920
notice right off the top about this.

111
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,482
One is that the way we've defined

112
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:29,406
interactions at boundaries, they're

113
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:32,162
effectively instantaneous. So each

114
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:35,202
agent, remember, interacts with its

115
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:37,758
boundary with some set of operators.

116
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:40,402
And what those operators do is

117
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:42,222
effectively measure each operator

118
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:44,418
effectively measures the spin of a

119
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:47,940
qubit. So this is a very fast process.

120
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,362
The other thing that we then need to

121
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:57,420
notice is that if we have two agents

122
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,634
and they're communicating with each

123
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:02,170
other classically,

124
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,466
then they're going to be using degrees

125
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:08,938
of freedom of their shared environment

126
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:11,466
in order to communicate. And that's

127
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:13,614
exactly what we're doing right now. For

128
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:16,314
example, we're using degrees of freedom

129
00:06:16,362 --> 00:06:19,718
of the Internet to communicate.

130
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:21,986
I'm using degrees of freedom of the

131
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,034
local atmosphere to talk to my

132
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:27,026
microphone and I'm using degrees of

133
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:30,194
freedom of the local photon field to see

134
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:34,626
my screen. So all communication

135
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:37,894
between agents and certainly all

136
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,280
classical communication between agents

137
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,566
uses degrees of freedom of the

138
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:44,062
environment. And the environment,

139
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:46,726
remember, is the other system, Bob,

140
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:49,254
that's on the other side of that shared

141
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:51,834
boundary. So we're going to be

142
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:54,614
interested in how components of Alice

143
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:58,046
use Bob as a communication channel and

144
00:06:58,068 --> 00:06:59,802
in fact, as multiple communication

145
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:03,902
channels. And I just wanted to quote my

146
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,814
colleague and friend Mike Levin in his

147
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:08,494
statement that all intelligence is

148
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:11,982
composite. All of us, all organisms,

149
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:15,502
even single cells, are composite

150
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:19,906
systems that comprise many different

151
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:22,310
agents that are able to make different

152
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,962
kinds of measurements and execute

153
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:27,654
different kinds of actions and so have

154
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:31,106
to communicate classically. So we're

155
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:33,494
talking about all of life here as well

156
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:37,046
as all of social systems and ecosystems

157
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:38,780
and such things as that.

158
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,754
So the first thing I want to do today is

159
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:47,786
simplify the notation so that we don't

160
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:49,482
have to draw quite such complicated

161
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:52,222
diagrams. So the picture on the left

162
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:54,618
here is a picture from the last session.

163
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:57,518
It shows the structure of a very simple

164
00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:01,294
agent that makes some measurements

165
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:04,594
using a reference frame called e and

166
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:06,674
then writes some results of those

167
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:09,534
measurements to memory using a reference

168
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:12,914
frame called y. And those two processes

169
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:15,782
are connected by an internal clock that

170
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:19,350
ticks between the input process

171
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,874
and the output process. And the clock

172
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:24,178
tick corresponds to the expenditure of

173
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,410
free energy to write information

174
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,786
irreversibly on the boundary. So the

175
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:31,386
memories are actually written on the

176
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,382
boundary because that's where classical

177
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,186
information lives in this theory. So you

178
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,278
can think of this whole process from e

179
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:42,254
through the clock and back to y as a

180
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:44,970
single quantum process or as a quantum

181
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,966
computation that maps some sector e of

182
00:08:47,988 --> 00:08:50,146
the boundary to some sector Y of the

183
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:53,394
boundary. And so we can represent it in

184
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,586
this much simpler way that's over on the

185
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:58,820
right side as some process Q

186
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,374
that maps some sector on the boundary to

187
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:05,110
some other sector on the boundary. And

188
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,926
formally, that process can be thought of

189
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:11,030
as a topological quantum field theory.

190
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,066
Topological here is important. It's not

191
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:16,266
geometric, it doesn't assume an

192
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,458
embedding in space and this will become

193
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:21,660
critically important later on.

194
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:27,390
And the operation of that tqft

195
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,338
requires a clock tick or it incorporates

196
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:34,926
a tick of this internal clock. And we

197
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:38,494
can do this because we were

198
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:42,502
able to prove jim Glazeburg

199
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:45,026
and Tanino Marciano and I were able to

200
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:47,538
prove last year that we can always

201
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:50,338
represent a quantum reference frame as a

202
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:53,014
topological quantum field theory. And

203
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:55,414
this just illustrates the two kinds of

204
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:58,146
transformations between quantum

205
00:09:58,178 --> 00:09:59,846
reference frames that are important. We

206
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:01,734
can take one and divide it into two

207
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:05,034
pieces that commute or we can

208
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:08,794
take a two

209
00:10:08,832 --> 00:10:12,010
part reference frame and we can

210
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,330
swap in another part that

211
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,234
doesn't commute with the part that we've

212
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:20,330
swapped it in for but that does commute

213
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,234
with the remainder of the reference

214
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:25,690
frame. So here R is the reference

215
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,174
component of some object identification

216
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:33,534
system and we can swap

217
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:35,314
in some different way of looking at the

218
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:37,682
object once we've identified it. So,

219
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:40,046
for example, if the object that we're

220
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:42,802
identifying is a box that can measure

221
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:46,098
both Z spin and X spin,

222
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:49,414
then P and Q can be the z spin and x

223
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:53,014
spin settings on that box that allow us

224
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,674
to effectively rotate the filter from

225
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:58,838
this way to that way so that we measure

226
00:10:59,014 --> 00:11:01,690
vertical spin versus horizontal spin.

227
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,266
And that's really it. I mean, those are

228
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:08,178
the ways that one can transform quantum

229
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:10,302
reference frames. Of course, we could do

230
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:12,446
arbitrarily many compositions of this

231
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:14,094
kind of transformation to do something

232
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,526
very complicated, but they map very

233
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:20,580
simply to tqfts with the structure and

234
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,002
you can construct categories out of this

235
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:25,806
and find a function that's well defined

236
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:28,306
that maps one category to another. So

237
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:30,580
it's an example of a nice use of

238
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,354
categorical techniques for solving

239
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,646
a problem that looks difficult but in

240
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:38,390
fact it's very straightforward.

241
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,750
So using this simplified notation,

242
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,818
it becomes very easy to see that

243
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:52,874
if we have two systems, alice and Bob on

244
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:56,042
opposite sides of this boundary and we

245
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:59,482
perfectly align their quantum reference

246
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:03,262
frames, which is what the FEP says

247
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:05,120
they will tend to do,

248
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,426
then they become entangled. And you

249
00:12:09,448 --> 00:12:11,842
can see that they're entangled by seeing

250
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:14,002
that once the reference frames are

251
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:17,326
perfectly aligned, they jointly

252
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:19,940
implement one quantum process.

253
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,002
And jointly implementing one quantum

254
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:26,630
process just means you're entangled.

255
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,720
The two sides no longer have

256
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,098
conditionally independent states. If one

257
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:37,162
quantum process, which is time

258
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,522
reversible, information preserving, is

259
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:43,930
implemented jointly by the two systems.

260
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,350
So a lot of things like this become very

261
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,734
simple when we think of these

262
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:56,602
processes as just quantum computations

263
00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:59,806
going on inside some system implemented

264
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:03,470
by some system and how those processes

265
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,926
relate across some boundary. So that's

266
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,302
what we're going to do for studying

267
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:12,680
communication today.

268
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,574
Another thing to recall from a couple of

269
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:21,286
sessions ago, our last session, is that

270
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:24,474
if two reference frames, q one and

271
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,882
Q Two commute, we can always

272
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,530
join them together to form a single

273
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,594
reference frame. And this is just a

274
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:36,906
graphical depiction in this simpler

275
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:40,000
language of how that works. And

276
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,754
topologically, there's no distinction

277
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:46,574
between the left side and the right

278
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:48,974
side. What I've done is just squeeze the

279
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:51,138
top two green circles together and the

280
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,202
bottom two green circles together into

281
00:13:53,256 --> 00:13:56,866
one circle. And that just makes a

282
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:59,426
simple process connecting the top one to

283
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:01,878
the bottom one. So what we're going to

284
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:04,134
be interested in is situations where

285
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:09,138
this doesn't happen, where Alice

286
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:13,298
consists of two components that execute

287
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:16,170
reference frames that don't commute.

288
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,034
And so the two components are

289
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:23,994
conditionally independent. They do each

290
00:14:24,032 --> 00:14:26,410
have free choice of reference frame.

291
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,210
And so they have to communicate

292
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,774
classically. They don't share a

293
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:36,030
single quantum process, so they're not

294
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,618
entangled. And before

295
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:43,154
we go ahead to do that, I just

296
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:46,514
wanted to remind you of some of the

297
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,522
no go theorems that follow from this

298
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:52,854
situation depicted on the right, where

299
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,374
we have a single agent executing a

300
00:14:56,412 --> 00:14:59,238
single reference frame, a single

301
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:02,310
process, a single kind of measurement,

302
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,626
any set of commuting measurements that

303
00:15:05,648 --> 00:15:08,006
can be combined into one measurement.

304
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,666
And here are some things Alice can't do.

305
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:12,442
And we've talked about some of these

306
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:15,466
previously. So this is basically a

307
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:20,090
reminder. But Alice

308
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,910
can't, using just one measurement,

309
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,078
measure the entanglement entropy across

310
00:15:26,164 --> 00:15:29,314
her own boundary. So Alice can't know

311
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:31,922
that she has an independent state. She

312
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:34,802
can't know that she's not entangled with

313
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:37,746
Bob. And that's a useful thing to think

314
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:41,406
about philosophically as it applies to

315
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:44,646
you and me. We can't actually know that

316
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,360
we have independent states.

317
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,562
Alice can't measure her own entanglement

318
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:54,314
entropy, so she can't know whether she

319
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:56,662
has components that have to communicate

320
00:15:56,726 --> 00:15:57,530
classically.

321
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,734
She can't measure Bob's entanglement

322
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:04,854
entropy, so she can't know whether Bob

323
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:06,686
has compartments that have to

324
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,486
communicate classically. And if you

325
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:11,550
think in terms of perception theory,

326
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,034
this says Alice can't know whether Bob

327
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:17,802
consists of separate objects that behave

328
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:18,670
classically.

329
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,074
Their behavior can look classical to

330
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:26,494
her, but she's not able to determine

331
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:29,282
that their behavior is classical because

332
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:32,354
she can't measure Bob's entanglement

333
00:16:32,402 --> 00:16:35,846
entropy. She can't measure the

334
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:39,798
dimension of her own boundary and

335
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:42,598
recall from a couple of times ago that

336
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:45,402
the boundary includes some sector that

337
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:48,774
supplies free energy that Alice can't

338
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:51,222
extract information from for further

339
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:53,514
processing, she can only extract free

340
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:57,306
energy from. So she can't measure the

341
00:16:57,328 --> 00:17:00,526
dimension of that sector, and so she

342
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:02,302
can't measure the dimension of the whole

343
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,942
boundary itself. And this, of course,

344
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:06,606
means that she can't measure her own

345
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:08,446
dimension either. And of course, she

346
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:10,414
can't measure Bob's dimension, because

347
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:13,074
the only information she can get about

348
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:15,166
Bob is the classical information that's

349
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:17,166
encoded on this boundary. She can't

350
00:17:17,278 --> 00:17:19,522
reach past the boundary to see how large

351
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:23,170
a system Bob is. And that's

352
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,054
clearly connected to this first point,

353
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:27,746
that she can't measure the entanglement

354
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:29,846
entropy across Bob, because the

355
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:32,246
entanglement entropy can only be small

356
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:34,726
if her dimension and Bob's dimension are

357
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:36,746
both much larger than the dimension of

358
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,794
the boundary. So that's a condition she

359
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:42,234
can't check. So all

360
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:44,794
of these kind of no go theorems lead off

361
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:47,406
in interesting directions. And the only

362
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:48,606
one that we're really going to be

363
00:17:48,628 --> 00:17:52,800
interested in here is

364
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,034
the third one, the one about measuring

365
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:57,374
Bob's entanglement entropy, because we

366
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:59,970
want to talk specifically about how

367
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,118
multiple agents, so multiple components

368
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:06,402
of Alice can access information about

369
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:08,610
Bob's entanglement entropy.

370
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,042
Okay, so recall from the end of the last

371
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,922
session that the last thing we talked

372
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:22,314
about was classical communication. And

373
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,582
we talked about the fact that classical

374
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:27,354
communication involves assumptions and

375
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:29,614
pitfalls and that we have to be very

376
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:32,766
careful whenever we talk about it. And

377
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:35,470
what we're going to do today is standard

378
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,078
practice in physics. We're simply going

379
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:41,614
to stipulate that these

380
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:44,194
components, a one and a two, the

381
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:46,030
separable components of Alice,

382
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,078
communicate classically. And so we're

383
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,538
going to draw it like this. We're going

384
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:51,490
to draw a classical channel between

385
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,594
them, and that classical channel passes

386
00:18:54,642 --> 00:18:57,314
through Bob. It uses degrees of freedom

387
00:18:57,362 --> 00:19:00,086
of the ambient photon field or the

388
00:19:00,188 --> 00:19:03,222
ambient atmosphere or pieces of paper or

389
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:06,054
email or something like that that's out

390
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:08,022
there in the environment to exchange

391
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:11,178
classical messages. And there are a

392
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,526
couple of things to note here I haven't

393
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:14,966
even written down here. We're assuming

394
00:19:14,998 --> 00:19:17,610
that a one and a two share some language

395
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,322
for this classical communication.

396
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:21,134
That's a big assumption, as we talked

397
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:24,494
about last time. But I

398
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,442
will note explicitly that classical

399
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:29,290
communication takes time. That's what

400
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,910
defines classicality here. It's causal,

401
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,438
so it can't work faster than the speed

402
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:39,150
of light. This is a topological theory.

403
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,102
We don't have any embedding geometry.

404
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,190
So we can't, at this point, talk about

405
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,750
light, which is a relationship between

406
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,742
space and time, because we've got time,

407
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,582
we've got clocks, but we don't have any

408
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:54,178
space. But we can say that

409
00:19:54,284 --> 00:19:56,550
whatever passes through this classical

410
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,342
channel requires at least one clock tick

411
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:04,074
on Bob's side. So it's a process

412
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:06,330
that Bob has to execute.

413
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,158
And executing that process takes time.

414
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:14,094
So getting the signal from me to

415
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:16,862
you on the internet takes some time. So

416
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,318
the environment's clock has to tick

417
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:22,402
during that. And all of these

418
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:25,346
assumptions bundled together turn out to

419
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:28,670
be a fairly serious set of assumptions

420
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,790
and they involve assumptions about fine

421
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,438
tuning, about the universe being just

422
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:38,006
right and they

423
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,214
should make us nervous and I just want

424
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:43,202
to leave it at that. We always assume

425
00:20:43,346 --> 00:20:45,994
with complete a plumb that agents can

426
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:48,154
communicate classically. But it's not a

427
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:50,166
straightforward assumption and it's

428
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:52,602
worth any of you are looking at for

429
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:56,234
interesting research projects can look

430
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:57,722
into the nature of classical

431
00:20:57,786 --> 00:21:00,042
communication. It's full of hidden

432
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:03,102
assumptions and surprises and things

433
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:04,846
that aren't at all straightforward even

434
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:06,846
though they look like they ought to be.

435
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:10,526
So there's a challenge. So why

436
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:12,154
do we assume this? Why do we assume

437
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:14,674
classical communication? We do it

438
00:21:14,712 --> 00:21:16,786
because we have to if we're going to

439
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,930
talk about detecting entanglement.

440
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,926
And most of

441
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,246
you probably know the history of the

442
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:28,502
notion of entanglement. It was first

443
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:31,778
noticed by Einstein, Podolski and Rosen

444
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:36,314
ever after called EPR in 1935.

445
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:39,290
And they wrote a paper which is infamous

446
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,514
and called the EPR Paper in which they

447
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,466
argued that the phenomenon of

448
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:47,802
entanglement made no sense and couldn't

449
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:51,070
possibly be physical. And since

450
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,494
quantum theory included this notion of

451
00:21:54,532 --> 00:21:57,806
entanglement, it couldn't possibly be a

452
00:21:57,828 --> 00:21:59,370
complete theory of what's going on in

453
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,426
the world. And Schrodinger replied the

454
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,498
same year with a very detailed paper

455
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:09,442
where he introduces, among other things,

456
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,774
Schrodinger's cat as a paradox. And he

457
00:22:12,812 --> 00:22:14,594
explains very clearly what entanglement

458
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:17,334
is and why entanglement follows from

459
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:20,102
quantum theory. And he uses that

460
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:22,402
discussion to argue that the classical

461
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,018
notion of a physical state is not

462
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:27,098
actually applicable to the world as it

463
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:30,122
is. So he answers the EPR paper very

464
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:35,354
directly. And this

465
00:22:35,472 --> 00:22:38,974
discussion is

466
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:41,146
currently mostly known as the Bohr

467
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:44,110
Einstein debate because of course Bohr

468
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,854
already in 1928 has said had said in

469
00:22:47,892 --> 00:22:50,226
print that the classical notion of

470
00:22:50,248 --> 00:22:52,174
causality in space and time simply

471
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:55,582
doesn't apply anymore. And Einstein

472
00:22:55,646 --> 00:22:58,386
objected to that vigorously. But that

473
00:22:58,408 --> 00:23:01,682
was 1935 and it was almost 50 years

474
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:03,734
later that entanglement was first

475
00:23:03,772 --> 00:23:05,702
observed in the laboratory. Here the

476
00:23:05,756 --> 00:23:07,974
1982 picture is a picture of the

477
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:12,166
interior of Alan Aspet's laboratory when

478
00:23:12,188 --> 00:23:13,714
he performed the first entanglement

479
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:16,298
experiment for which he finally won the

480
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:18,060
Nobel Prize last year.

481
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,398
And these days this kind of experiment

482
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:26,854
is done all over the world and is even

483
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:29,310
done with satellite borne sources.

484
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,934
Resource is the key to quantum

485
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:40,494
secured communication, as we'll discuss

486
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:43,602
in quantum cryptography and quantum

487
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,326
banking and the quantum internet, all

488
00:23:46,348 --> 00:23:47,846
this other stuff that you may have heard

489
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:50,950
of. So before

490
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,582
talking more about these experiments,

491
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:58,490
I just want to provide

492
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,570
a definition of entanglement.

493
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,278
Entangled simply means not separable.

494
00:24:06,374 --> 00:24:09,774
That's the definition. So a state, a

495
00:24:09,812 --> 00:24:12,942
joint state AB is entangled if and only

496
00:24:12,996 --> 00:24:16,560
if it does not factor into

497
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,220
two separable states.

498
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,930
And that's it. That's the definition.

499
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,766
And the literature,

500
00:24:26,878 --> 00:24:29,486
and especially the popular literature,

501
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:33,182
is absolutely rife with hype and various

502
00:24:33,246 --> 00:24:36,950
kinds of mischief of entanglement and

503
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,742
authors trying to convince you that

504
00:24:38,796 --> 00:24:42,120
entanglement is this amazing

505
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,540
kind of woo woo thing.

506
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,074
And whenever you run across that, go

507
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:51,030
back to the definition, entanglement

508
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,854
simply means this simple mathematical

509
00:24:54,902 --> 00:24:58,766
condition of not separability or a

510
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,646
state that isn't factorizable. And that

511
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,122
means that the state does not display

512
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:06,990
classical conditional independence. So

513
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,626
classically, that's the way to think

514
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:10,750
about it. It's a failure of conditional

515
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,178
independence. And it's ubiquitous in

516
00:25:14,184 --> 00:25:15,934
quantum theory, even though it wasn't

517
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,130
actually absurd for almost 50 years

518
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,650
after it was predicted.

519
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,666
So here's what all these experiments

520
00:25:23,698 --> 00:25:25,682
look like. They're called Bell EPR

521
00:25:25,746 --> 00:25:27,750
experiments, after John Bell,

522
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,242
who derived the statistical criterion

523
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:35,406
for detecting entanglement and EPR.

524
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:38,474
Einstein, Podolski and Rosen, who did

525
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:40,618
this as a thought experiment and said,

526
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:43,174
if this occurs in the theory, it can't

527
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:45,274
possibly be real. And of course it is

528
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:48,334
real. It's now amply demonstrated by

529
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:51,022
experimentation. Here's how they work.

530
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:54,574
There's a source. The source produces a

531
00:25:54,612 --> 00:25:57,562
state that is entangled.

532
00:25:57,706 --> 00:26:00,846
And I've written the typical what's

533
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:03,314
called a Bell state. It's up plus or

534
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:06,066
minus down divided by the square root of

535
00:26:06,088 --> 00:26:09,266
two just to normalize it. But up plus or

536
00:26:09,288 --> 00:26:12,582
minus down is clearly not the same as up

537
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:15,042
times down. So this is not a separable

538
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,994
state. And this state propagates outward

539
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:22,566
in space and time to two observers who

540
00:26:22,588 --> 00:26:25,286
have independent laboratories, for

541
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:27,274
example, on different continents. In

542
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:29,546
that space based experiment that I

543
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:31,194
showed you the picture of from the COVID

544
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:34,138
of Science a few years ago, 2017, I

545
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:38,042
think, the Tulip observers have freedom

546
00:26:38,106 --> 00:26:40,058
to choose their own reference frame,

547
00:26:40,154 --> 00:26:42,830
their own Z axis for measuring spin.

548
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,966
They do a spin measurement, and they do

549
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:47,854
this over and over and over again. They

550
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:51,662
accumulate statistics and they exchange

551
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:54,510
their results so that they can analyze

552
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,722
the joint statistics of their

553
00:26:56,776 --> 00:26:59,074
experiment. And they check to see

554
00:26:59,112 --> 00:27:01,222
whether that joint statistics is

555
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:03,058
consistent with classical probability

556
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:07,494
theory. And if it isn't to

557
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:11,080
a statistically significant level, then

558
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,022
they've been able to detect

559
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:16,794
entanglement. Now, notice that this

560
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:18,982
process requires classical

561
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:21,562
communication. They have to make their

562
00:27:21,616 --> 00:27:23,514
independent measurements in their own

563
00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:25,994
laboratories, and then they have to

564
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:28,606
exchange results, or one of them has to

565
00:27:28,628 --> 00:27:30,654
send results to the other one, or they

566
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,494
both have to send their results to some

567
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:35,978
third party. But in all of these cases,

568
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:38,962
they're exchanging some classical data.

569
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:41,842
And so we have the assumption that

570
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:44,126
whoever gets that classical data knows

571
00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:47,490
the language it was recorded in and so

572
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,730
can do a joint analysis.

573
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,326
So I'll just show you another picture of

574
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:55,318
this experiment that's in a standard

575
00:27:55,404 --> 00:27:57,654
space time diagram here. Time is

576
00:27:57,692 --> 00:27:59,830
vertical, space is horizontal.

577
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,346
The two observers are labeled Alice and

578
00:28:04,368 --> 00:28:08,426
Bob. They share a quantum channel

579
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:11,194
that goes from Alice to the source to

580
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,340
Bob. That's the entangled state.

581
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,534
They do some processing. And then one of

582
00:28:17,572 --> 00:28:20,526
them here, Bob, sends the results to

583
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:22,730
Alice. And that's a classical

584
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,206
communication. It takes time, and it

585
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:29,762
traverses space. So this step

586
00:28:29,816 --> 00:28:32,850
is classical. So this is why we have to

587
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,234
assume classical communication to talk

588
00:28:35,272 --> 00:28:39,250
about detecting or using entanglement.

589
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,646
So now I want to represent this in a

590
00:28:42,668 --> 00:28:46,742
different way. Using our little

591
00:28:46,796 --> 00:28:49,286
picture earlier. We're going to think of

592
00:28:49,308 --> 00:28:51,494
Alice, again as two components, a one

593
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:55,066
and a two. They're separable, so they

594
00:28:55,088 --> 00:28:57,546
have to communicate classically. They

595
00:28:57,568 --> 00:28:59,194
have a classical channel that goes

596
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:02,442
through Bob, and they also now share

597
00:29:02,496 --> 00:29:04,794
some quantum channel. They share an

598
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:07,674
entangled state. And the entangled

599
00:29:07,722 --> 00:29:09,642
state, of course, is produced by Bob.

600
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:13,470
The source is part of Bob. And their

601
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,286
detectors, if you want to think about it

602
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:18,702
that way, are located on this boundary

603
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:21,550
B, or their interface with the sources

604
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,882
on this boundary B. And each of them

605
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:28,670
executes a process that accumulates

606
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,062
data from the quantum channel and

607
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:33,122
communicates it to the other observer

608
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:36,374
via the classical channel. Now,

609
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:38,566
this picture illustrates what's called a

610
00:29:38,588 --> 00:29:41,478
lock protocol. Lock means local

611
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:44,250
operations and classical communication.

612
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,798
So a one and a two are each operating

613
00:29:47,894 --> 00:29:50,246
locally on their boundary. They're

614
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:52,234
making measurements locally on their

615
00:29:52,272 --> 00:29:55,874
boundary, and they're communicating via

616
00:29:56,022 --> 00:29:58,622
actions locally on their boundary and

617
00:29:58,676 --> 00:30:00,938
observations locally on their boundary.

618
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:05,134
So, for example, I'm communicating with

619
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:08,074
my computer here. We can consider it my

620
00:30:08,132 --> 00:30:10,866
boundary. And stuff is happening in the

621
00:30:10,888 --> 00:30:13,346
environment that's implemented by the

622
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:16,274
Internet, and you're receiving those

623
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:20,030
communications locally on your boundary,

624
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,386
on your laptop or whatever it is you're

625
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:25,522
using. So that's what local operations

626
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:29,442
means. And these protocols

627
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:31,122
specifically involve classical

628
00:30:31,186 --> 00:30:33,306
communication. And so they're able to

629
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:36,134
detect entanglement. And a Bell EPR

630
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:38,534
experiment is just an example of a lock

631
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:43,062
protocol. The observers exchange

632
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:44,986
information about how they're going to

633
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:46,698
do their experiments. They're both going

634
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:49,102
to measure D spin. They're going to use

635
00:30:49,156 --> 00:30:51,034
independently chosen reference frames,

636
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,874
and they're going to look at the output

637
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:55,070
from some agreed upon source.

638
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,480
So that's all classically set up.

639
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,674
Then they actually make their

640
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:02,798
observations, and then they classically

641
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,342
communicate their results. So classical

642
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:09,454
communication front and back lock

643
00:31:09,502 --> 00:31:12,934
protocols are not limited to this sort

644
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:16,566
of Bell EPR sort

645
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:19,606
of setting. We can also represent a

646
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,746
scattering experiment as a lock

647
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:26,886
protocol. So here's

648
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,126
a representation of scattering as a lock

649
00:31:29,158 --> 00:31:31,820
protocol. And you can see all I've done

650
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,330
is cut that previous

651
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:39,134
boundary at the division between a

652
00:31:39,172 --> 00:31:42,894
one and a two. And I've then extended it

653
00:31:43,012 --> 00:31:45,600
in some external time,

654
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,442
the time that is counted by

655
00:31:51,496 --> 00:31:54,290
Bob's clock, not by Alice's clock.

656
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,250
That's what's meant by external.

657
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,682
And I've relabeled Alice two as Alice

658
00:32:01,746 --> 00:32:05,154
one at a later time. So now what Alice

659
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:07,558
is doing is communicating with her past

660
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:11,366
self, or a one is communicating with

661
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,842
her future self, and they're each

662
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:19,290
doing something different. A one is

663
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,106
executing a procedure that in the

664
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:24,490
laboratory we call state preparation.

665
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,138
She's preparing a state that we'll call

666
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:31,822
in, which is just the initial state

667
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:33,966
of some scattering experiment. So, for

668
00:32:33,988 --> 00:32:36,590
example, at the LHC,

669
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,006
N is some state of two protons that

670
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:43,422
are portaling around the ring at the LHC

671
00:32:43,486 --> 00:32:45,220
at close to the speed of light.

672
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,842
And Alice, then later

673
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:53,174
on at T plus delta, t is

674
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:54,994
doing a different kind of quantum

675
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:58,374
process. She's analyzing the data coming

676
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:00,034
out of something like the Atlas

677
00:33:00,082 --> 00:33:03,350
detector, which is a multiparticle

678
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,730
counter that's located at the LHC.

679
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,634
So they share a quantum channel, which

680
00:33:10,672 --> 00:33:13,642
is the scattering channel that takes the

681
00:33:13,696 --> 00:33:16,474
incoming state and produces the outgoing

682
00:33:16,522 --> 00:33:20,394
state. And I recall

683
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:23,162
from the very first session, as Feynman

684
00:33:23,226 --> 00:33:26,250
told us, to understand this transition

685
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,182
from in to out, we have to integrate

686
00:33:29,246 --> 00:33:31,394
over all possible paths that are

687
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:37,006
consistent with conservation of spin.

688
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:39,970
Holicity basically momentum plus spin.

689
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,054
All the different spins that are

690
00:33:44,092 --> 00:33:45,954
relevant in a high energy physics

691
00:33:46,002 --> 00:33:48,242
experiment, including things like Lepton

692
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:50,790
number, which is basically a spin.

693
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,874
Now, how do we know? How do we know what

694
00:33:54,912 --> 00:33:57,706
we have to conserve? We know what we

695
00:33:57,728 --> 00:34:00,682
have to conserve because Alice is doing

696
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:03,610
the experiment has a classical memory

697
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,502
that allows her to remember what she

698
00:34:07,556 --> 00:34:10,414
prepared. She can remember that what she

699
00:34:10,452 --> 00:34:13,790
did back in the past was

700
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,206
set to protons counterrotating in the

701
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:19,642
LHC, and they had certain energies,

702
00:34:19,706 --> 00:34:21,506
and so they had certain momenta, and

703
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:23,442
they were protons, so they had certain

704
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:26,754
spin variables. All of that has to be

705
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:29,394
remembered to make any sense of the

706
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:33,590
output of the detectors. And so

707
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,202
to actually come up with a measured

708
00:34:37,266 --> 00:34:41,254
state that makes sense. And very

709
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:45,370
often this memory channel is neglected

710
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,086
by physicists. And I'm going to pause

711
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:49,980
here and let Andrew ask a question.

712
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,214
Thank you, Chris. So does this imply

713
00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:57,518
that every time you have a log channel,

714
00:34:57,604 --> 00:35:00,686
the quantum part is a

715
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:02,186
scattering picture, like a unitary

716
00:35:02,218 --> 00:35:04,154
evolution? Even in the earlier EPR

717
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,842
picture, is that quantum channel portion

718
00:35:06,906 --> 00:35:09,246
always a unitary evolution scattering

719
00:35:09,278 --> 00:35:11,300
picture? Thank you.

720
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:17,886
Yes, for essentially

721
00:35:17,998 --> 00:35:21,578
the reason that defined

722
00:35:21,614 --> 00:35:23,334
a classical channel, you're always

723
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,466
assuming you have something that's

724
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:26,646
protected from decoherence by the

725
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:29,000
environment. So,

726
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,462
yeah, if you're doing an EPR experiment,

727
00:35:33,526 --> 00:35:35,834
you have to assume that you don't have

728
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:38,810
any environmental decoherence between

729
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,426
the source and the detectors. And

730
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,106
similarly, when you're doing a

731
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:47,246
scattering experiment, you have to make

732
00:35:47,268 --> 00:35:50,314
the assumption that the environment

733
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:52,682
is not reaching in there and messing

734
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:55,738
with the outgoing state that you're

735
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,866
going to see, or reaching in and messing

736
00:35:57,898 --> 00:35:59,806
with the incoming state and changing it

737
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:03,826
in some way that repepes it in

738
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:05,506
a way that you don't know, that you have

739
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:08,882
no knowledge of. So, yes, you're making

740
00:36:08,936 --> 00:36:11,922
a fairly strong antidecornce assumption

741
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:13,746
in any of these settings when you're

742
00:36:13,778 --> 00:36:15,640
talking about having a quantum channel.

743
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,014
Does that answer the question? Yes.

744
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:22,920
Thank you. Okay, great.

745
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,270
So we can think of lock,

746
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,250
we can think of scattering as Locke,

747
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:37,534
and I just wanted to now emphasize that

748
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:40,778
effectively. What Locke is implementing

749
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:43,402
is two parallel memories. A classical

750
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:46,926
memory, which, as we said in the case of

751
00:36:46,948 --> 00:36:49,330
scattering, is memory for preparation.

752
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,740
In the EPR case, it's memory for

753
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,374
preparation for what the experimental

754
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,194
setup is, for what the instructions for

755
00:36:58,232 --> 00:36:59,940
doing the experiment are.

756
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:04,070
And we also have a quantum channel,

757
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,058
which is effectively another memory.

758
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:09,558
It's something that's extended through

759
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,806
time. And again, it's implemented by

760
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:15,254
the environment, implemented by Bob,

761
00:37:15,382 --> 00:37:18,570
and it involves Bob's. Clock ticking.

762
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:23,398
So whenever we have two memories

763
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:27,114
in parallel, we can construct an error

764
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,438
correcting code. So think of a simple

765
00:37:29,524 --> 00:37:31,760
classical error correcting code.

766
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:36,414
For example, the use of parity bits in

767
00:37:36,452 --> 00:37:39,154
exchanging digital data. So if I send

768
00:37:39,192 --> 00:37:41,810
you a bit string classically,

769
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,220
and I send it to you two or three times,

770
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,806
so there's some redundancy in my signal

771
00:37:49,998 --> 00:37:53,014
and I send you a parity bit, I say,

772
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:55,846
okay, add up your bit string, and the

773
00:37:55,868 --> 00:37:58,502
result should be one. It's one on my

774
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:01,718
side. If you add it up and you

775
00:38:01,724 --> 00:38:03,830
get zero, there's an error someplace.

776
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,374
You can use that parity bit to detect

777
00:38:06,422 --> 00:38:09,946
errors. So you can throw out the

778
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:12,394
bit strings that you receive that have

779
00:38:12,432 --> 00:38:14,874
parity of zero and say, oh, the

780
00:38:14,912 --> 00:38:17,966
environment interfered somehow with the

781
00:38:17,988 --> 00:38:20,058
signal, or some eavesdropper interfered

782
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:21,694
with the signal. It made a mistake, or

783
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,510
something like that. So this corresponds

784
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,418
to environmental decoherence not being a

785
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:30,046
good assumption. Even though it's

786
00:38:30,078 --> 00:38:32,146
classical, environmental interference is

787
00:38:32,168 --> 00:38:34,180
not a good assumption in this case.

788
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,066
So a quantum error correct encoder is

789
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:41,286
basically the same idea. I use some

790
00:38:41,468 --> 00:38:44,998
feature of the fact that I have two

791
00:38:45,084 --> 00:38:49,320
different memories and that

792
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:53,690
I'm encoding something in time.

793
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,586
I'm encoding multiple replicates of

794
00:38:56,608 --> 00:39:00,282
something in time to provide

795
00:39:00,336 --> 00:39:03,158
a way of checking to make sure that I'm

796
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:04,940
sending the correct message.

797
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,400
So I can, for example,

798
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,770
consider the message to be my classical

799
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,760
memory and consider the quantum process

800
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:21,650
as a process that tests that memory.

801
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,162
So I remember that I need to do

802
00:39:24,216 --> 00:39:27,300
experiment X, and I will get result Y.

803
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,206
I actually do experiment X on

804
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:33,446
this quantum channel and see if I get

805
00:39:33,468 --> 00:39:36,806
result Y. And if

806
00:39:36,828 --> 00:39:38,706
I don't get result Y, then something's

807
00:39:38,738 --> 00:39:42,194
wrong. Either I can't trust the quantum

808
00:39:42,242 --> 00:39:46,554
channel or I've remembered my

809
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:50,154
preparation conditions incorrectly. So

810
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:52,554
I'm using one memory to check the

811
00:39:52,592 --> 00:40:00,206
accuracy of the other. And this using

812
00:40:00,308 --> 00:40:02,222
something about the environment, some

813
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:04,414
channel in the environment to check

814
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:08,058
memory is absolutely ubiquitous,

815
00:40:08,234 --> 00:40:11,378
and we use it all the time.

816
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:14,020
So, for example, look around your room,

817
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:18,146
and your room hopefully looks more or

818
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:19,986
less the same now that it did at the

819
00:40:20,008 --> 00:40:21,910
start of this session.

820
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,830
And that's very reassuring.

821
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,142
It reassures you that something's not

822
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:31,590
happening in the environment that's

823
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,914
dangerous and disturbing. And if you

824
00:40:35,952 --> 00:40:39,830
couldn't do that, if your environment

825
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,690
was constantly changing and there was no

826
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,126
familiarity about the environment, you

827
00:40:46,148 --> 00:40:47,870
wouldn't be able to check your memory.

828
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,806
You wouldn't be able to. Check your

829
00:40:49,828 --> 00:40:53,422
sanity. So even though we don't think

830
00:40:53,476 --> 00:40:56,622
about our local environments as

831
00:40:56,676 --> 00:40:58,782
effectively an error correcting code,

832
00:40:58,836 --> 00:41:01,022
that's exactly how we use it. We use

833
00:41:01,076 --> 00:41:03,826
stigmurgic memory or memory out there in

834
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:06,466
the environment as a way of checking our

835
00:41:06,488 --> 00:41:08,914
own memories and assuring that our

836
00:41:08,952 --> 00:41:10,180
memory is okay.

837
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,004
So I talked a little bit about quantum

838
00:41:16,052 --> 00:41:19,864
security. Here's how quantum security

839
00:41:19,982 --> 00:41:21,636
system works again. It's a lock

840
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:25,352
protocol. We have some classical

841
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,476
signal that can be thought of as a code

842
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:32,476
or a key or a

843
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:36,756
one time pad, for example, that encodes

844
00:41:36,808 --> 00:41:40,192
a way of doing experiments. And once

845
00:41:40,246 --> 00:41:42,316
that's been exchanged, assuming it's

846
00:41:42,348 --> 00:41:45,644
secure, then we can use the quantum

847
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:49,008
channel to communicate information. And

848
00:41:49,094 --> 00:41:51,236
the classical channel has told us what

849
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,308
we have to do with that quantum channel.

850
00:41:54,394 --> 00:41:55,876
We have to make certain kinds of

851
00:41:55,898 --> 00:41:59,472
measurements at, say, particular clock

852
00:41:59,536 --> 00:42:02,056
times as measured. And we'll get

853
00:42:02,078 --> 00:42:05,864
information sent from the

854
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:09,000
past, from the sender.

855
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,956
And the classical channel protects

856
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:16,824
the quantum channel from adversarial

857
00:42:16,872 --> 00:42:19,644
agents, because anything that an

858
00:42:19,682 --> 00:42:22,312
adversarial agent does to the quantum

859
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:25,180
channel, if some agent tries to

860
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,164
eavesdrop, for example, on the quantum

861
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,484
channel, they'll disrupt the quantum

862
00:42:29,532 --> 00:42:32,272
channel. And the results of our

863
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:35,756
measurement will not be what's

864
00:42:35,788 --> 00:42:37,856
expected given the protocol that we run,

865
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:42,464
that we have run. So quantum

866
00:42:42,512 --> 00:42:45,252
communication is secured by the fact

867
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:47,824
that interfering with some entangled

868
00:42:47,872 --> 00:42:50,084
state actually destroys the state so

869
00:42:50,122 --> 00:42:53,592
it's detectable. We can always know

870
00:42:53,646 --> 00:42:56,184
if someone is trying to disrupt our

871
00:42:56,222 --> 00:42:58,184
communications, which isn't true if we

872
00:42:58,222 --> 00:43:00,360
just have two classical channels.

873
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,080
Charlie can always intercept a message

874
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,372
and then recreate it. And that's not

875
00:43:05,426 --> 00:43:08,110
possible with the quantum channel.

876
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,220
So let's refold this diagram

877
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,224
so that we've taken the external time

878
00:43:18,422 --> 00:43:20,130
back out of it.

879
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,624
And we have this picture where the two

880
00:43:24,662 --> 00:43:27,084
components of Alice are just interacting

881
00:43:27,132 --> 00:43:29,164
via their shared boundary with their

882
00:43:29,222 --> 00:43:33,076
environment. Bob and now we can see that

883
00:43:33,098 --> 00:43:35,540
the source of redundancy is not time,

884
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,190
it's the boundary itself.

885
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,160
Just sharing the boundary allows

886
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,144
Alice's components, a one and a two,

887
00:43:47,342 --> 00:43:50,970
to put copies of the same information

888
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,940
on different places on the boundary.

889
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,232
So the boundary now becomes a resource

890
00:43:58,296 --> 00:44:00,510
for redundant storage of information.

891
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,396
So Alice one and Alice two can use

892
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:10,192
different parts of the boundary to

893
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:12,956
check what other parts of the boundary,

894
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:15,676
say, to check the information that's

895
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:18,080
encoded on other parts of the boundary

896
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,360
so they can define an error correct

897
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:24,916
encode on the boundary itself using

898
00:44:25,018 --> 00:44:26,740
this lock protocol.

899
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,770
So I just want to leave you with this

900
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,104
idea that using

901
00:44:38,222 --> 00:44:41,850
classical and quantum channels together

902
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,216
allows us to define error

903
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:49,452
correcting codes on boundaries that we

904
00:44:49,506 --> 00:44:55,310
share as separate agents and

905
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,960
leave you to think about what

906
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,964
shared measurements, what shared quantum

907
00:45:04,012 --> 00:45:07,970
reference frames let us as agents

908
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,710
see the same things.

909
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,452
And this is what we'll talk about next

910
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:20,276
time in September. We'll talk

911
00:45:20,378 --> 00:45:24,676
specifically about how space provides

912
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:28,536
us with an error correcting code and

913
00:45:28,718 --> 00:45:32,008
try to understand why space

914
00:45:32,174 --> 00:45:36,108
is treated as emergent from something

915
00:45:36,194 --> 00:45:40,364
else, basically from communication in

916
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:43,404
most of quantum gravity. So thank you

917
00:45:43,442 --> 00:45:46,268
very much. I encourage you to use the

918
00:45:46,274 --> 00:45:48,736
interactive QA and to attend the

919
00:45:48,758 --> 00:45:51,664
discussion sessions, and we'll see you

920
00:45:51,702 --> 00:45:53,890
in September. Thank you.

921
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,900
Awesome. Chris,

922
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,996
thank you for the lecture. Andrew, do

923
00:46:05,018 --> 00:46:08,260
you have any remarks or

924
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:11,750
questions? Not right now, thank you.

925
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,496
I'll just ask a few quick questions and

926
00:46:15,518 --> 00:46:17,512
if anyone has one, quickly in the live

927
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,056
chat. So you mentioned the tick of the

928
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:22,932
clock, and in active inference,

929
00:46:22,996 --> 00:46:26,012
we often hold up side by side both the

930
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:28,456
discrete time models and the continuous

931
00:46:28,488 --> 00:46:31,592
time models. So do clocks have to tick

932
00:46:31,656 --> 00:46:34,556
discreetly or how do we think about

933
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,460
continuous time modeling.

934
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,616
In this quantum setting? They do have to

935
00:46:41,638 --> 00:46:44,896
tick discreetly because one has to

936
00:46:44,918 --> 00:46:48,812
be able to distinguish Alice's

937
00:46:48,876 --> 00:46:51,156
preparation of the qubits on her

938
00:46:51,178 --> 00:46:54,228
boundary from Bob's measurements of the

939
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,100
qubits on the boundary.

940
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,172
And this

941
00:47:01,226 --> 00:47:03,944
process can be extremely fast with

942
00:47:03,982 --> 00:47:05,656
respect to any kind of sense of

943
00:47:05,678 --> 00:47:07,130
macroscopic time.

944
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,650
Your eyes are responding to photons in,

945
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,060
I think it's hundreds of femtoseconds.

946
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,736
So the discrete transitions

947
00:47:21,768 --> 00:47:24,300
that are effectively time measurements

948
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,732
for you are at that very fast molecular

949
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:32,272
timescale, much, much faster than our

950
00:47:32,326 --> 00:47:36,144
typical clocks. Now,

951
00:47:36,342 --> 00:47:38,988
when we try to do very fast timing,

952
00:47:39,084 --> 00:47:41,284
we're constructing a faster clock than

953
00:47:41,322 --> 00:47:44,452
that, but it's a clock that we can only

954
00:47:44,506 --> 00:47:45,860
observe indirectly.

955
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,260
Awesome. Okay. Now this one maybe

956
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,810
connects a little bit to application,

957
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,408
but with all the developments happening

958
00:47:59,574 --> 00:48:01,596
in theory, some of which you're

959
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,416
reviewing here and also in practice with

960
00:48:04,438 --> 00:48:07,356
quantum computation, and then keeping in

961
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:09,824
mind this distinction sorry, I've lost

962
00:48:09,872 --> 00:48:12,390
you back.

963
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,364
I've lost you, Daniel. Okay, we'll wait

964
00:48:20,402 --> 00:48:22,908
till you're back. I can see you. No.

965
00:48:22,994 --> 00:48:25,340
Okay. All right. Just repeat.

966
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,744
Yeah. So so given these rapid and

967
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,936
ongoing developments in theory and

968
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:34,128
practice related to quantum information

969
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:35,908
science and quantum information

970
00:48:35,994 --> 00:48:40,100
security, how are people using this

971
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,152
distinction of the classical stigmagic

972
00:48:43,216 --> 00:48:46,368
memory and then the quantum cognitive

973
00:48:46,464 --> 00:48:51,992
process to anticipate how

974
00:48:52,046 --> 00:48:55,128
to develop information systems that are

975
00:48:55,214 --> 00:48:57,210
reliable going forward?

976
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,212
I don't know of any instances in

977
00:49:05,266 --> 00:49:08,856
which thinking about quantum cognition

978
00:49:08,968 --> 00:49:12,270
has entered directly into any design of

979
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,880
communication systems.

980
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:19,024
The ability of humans to interact with

981
00:49:19,062 --> 00:49:21,360
these systems is just assumed.

982
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,032
So it's just assumed that the user

983
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,548
can interact with, say, a computer

984
00:49:28,634 --> 00:49:32,004
interface, which is the sort

985
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:34,644
of interface that will be provided or is

986
00:49:34,682 --> 00:49:37,816
provided to any quantum computer. So if

987
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:40,344
you think about a quantum computer, a

988
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:43,272
practical quantum computer, it has

989
00:49:43,406 --> 00:49:45,770
classical interfaces front and back.

990
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,164
So in thinking about

991
00:49:50,302 --> 00:49:52,264
interacting with the computer, I'm

992
00:49:52,312 --> 00:49:54,428
giving it some classical problem

993
00:49:54,514 --> 00:49:57,836
statement, for example, and asking for

994
00:49:57,858 --> 00:49:59,896
some classical answer. And what it's

995
00:49:59,928 --> 00:50:01,176
going to give me is a probability

996
00:50:01,288 --> 00:50:03,520
distribution of classical answers.

997
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,612
But I can, by running the calculation

998
00:50:07,676 --> 00:50:09,596
many times, make that probability

999
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:11,520
distribution fairly tight.

1000
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,682
Yeah, I don't know of anyone talking

1001
00:50:17,736 --> 00:50:21,438
about quantum BCIs at this point. It'd

1002
00:50:21,454 --> 00:50:22,900
be an interesting question.

1003
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:30,530
Was it always understood these

1004
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,150
sorts of blind spots and axioms

1005
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,450
associated with classical communication.

1006
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,186
Was it developed as kind of like a

1007
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:45,178
proposal or like a special case and more

1008
00:50:45,264 --> 00:50:47,434
unpacking was left for later? Or are

1009
00:50:47,472 --> 00:50:49,274
these blind spots things that we're now

1010
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,594
coming into awareness of? Given what

1011
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,886
we're learning in the quantum

1012
00:50:52,918 --> 00:50:56,666
information sciences? I think we're

1013
00:50:56,698 --> 00:50:58,560
learning how serious they are.

1014
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,014
But they were certainly recognized even

1015
00:51:02,052 --> 00:51:04,720
by Bohr in his 1928 paper.

1016
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,930
And that's a very good

1017
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,130
paper, too. It's called the present

1018
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,794
state of quantum theory or something

1019
00:51:13,832 --> 00:51:17,294
like that. And it's in Nature, and it's

1020
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:19,410
available on the web somewhere.

1021
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:25,510
I have a copy of it. But it was written,

1022
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,926
in a sense, as Bohr's summary of the

1023
00:51:27,948 --> 00:51:30,614
1927 Solve Conference, which was the

1024
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:33,194
conference at which everyone doing

1025
00:51:33,232 --> 00:51:35,930
quantum theory at that time got together

1026
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,074
to talk about their results. And in

1027
00:51:40,112 --> 00:51:44,230
it, Bohr essentially presents what

1028
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,154
came to be the Copenhagen

1029
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:50,320
interpretation, which I

1030
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:55,034
think is probably unfairly

1031
00:51:55,082 --> 00:51:57,940
called an interpretation. It's sort of

1032
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:01,614
the Copenhagen Pragmatic stance toward

1033
00:52:01,662 --> 00:52:05,858
quantum theory. And essentially what

1034
00:52:05,944 --> 00:52:11,030
Bohr says is that

1035
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,430
if we're going to do science,

1036
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,374
we have to assume that people can talk

1037
00:52:16,412 --> 00:52:20,166
to each other. And if we're going to

1038
00:52:20,188 --> 00:52:23,194
do science, we have to assume that there

1039
00:52:23,312 --> 00:52:26,170
are instruments that we can manipulate

1040
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:29,674
and have reasonable confidence that we

1041
00:52:29,712 --> 00:52:32,746
know what manipulation we've done. So if

1042
00:52:32,768 --> 00:52:36,478
I turn a knob from one to two, I have

1043
00:52:36,484 --> 00:52:38,426
to be reasonably confident that I'm

1044
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,574
making a particular change that I can

1045
00:52:40,612 --> 00:52:44,480
understand. And we have to

1046
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,906
have reasonable confidence that

1047
00:52:48,008 --> 00:52:50,066
different laboratories can replicate the

1048
00:52:50,088 --> 00:52:53,186
same experiment. And if we

1049
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:55,042
think about any of those assumptions in

1050
00:52:55,096 --> 00:52:57,220
purely quantum theoretic terms,

1051
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:00,818
then all sorts of questions are raised,

1052
00:53:00,914 --> 00:53:04,178
right? Every quantum system is unique.

1053
00:53:04,354 --> 00:53:06,982
We have the no Cloning theorem, so every

1054
00:53:07,036 --> 00:53:08,870
scientific instrument is unique.

1055
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:13,098
So there's no such thing as exactly

1056
00:53:13,184 --> 00:53:15,740
replicating an experiment. Right?

1057
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:19,066
That's a coarse grained description of

1058
00:53:19,088 --> 00:53:21,190
what I've done with a completely unique

1059
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:24,494
quantum system. And my brain, of course,

1060
00:53:24,532 --> 00:53:27,646
is unique, and yours is too.

1061
00:53:27,668 --> 00:53:31,550
And everyone else's is. So talking

1062
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,718
about us sharing a language is

1063
00:53:34,804 --> 00:53:37,070
essentially a coarse grained assumption.

1064
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:41,266
And what the Copenhagen stance is all

1065
00:53:41,288 --> 00:53:43,934
about is coarse graining yielding

1066
00:53:43,982 --> 00:53:46,674
effective classicality? Or what that

1067
00:53:46,712 --> 00:53:50,418
really means is coarse graining yielding

1068
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:53,446
a description that we can use in the

1069
00:53:53,468 --> 00:53:56,406
language that we understand? So these

1070
00:53:56,428 --> 00:54:00,406
are very, very old issues that

1071
00:54:00,428 --> 00:54:02,620
have been recognized for a long time,

1072
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,850
but I think in part because of the

1073
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,330
disaster of shut up and calculate,

1074
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,386
they haven't really been talked about in

1075
00:54:11,408 --> 00:54:12,250
the classroom.

1076
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,342
Awesome. I'll just read short questions

1077
00:54:17,396 --> 00:54:20,526
from the chat. We can pass them to the

1078
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,782
discussion section, but there's a lot of

1079
00:54:22,836 --> 00:54:25,882
great diverse questions. So Alexi wrote,

1080
00:54:26,026 --> 00:54:29,246
I think I've lost you again. The revenge

1081
00:54:29,278 --> 00:54:32,734
of zoom. Well, we looked at the chart

1082
00:54:32,782 --> 00:54:34,754
earlier where, like, Bob was talking to

1083
00:54:34,792 --> 00:54:37,570
Alice, the Unidirectional.

1084
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,286
Okay, okay. The Unidirectional. The

1085
00:54:43,308 --> 00:54:45,640
third party is recording it, I'm sure.

1086
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:49,990
Alexi wrote, regarding the environment

1087
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:53,386
being used for error correction, a

1088
00:54:53,408 --> 00:54:55,530
symptom of derealization in

1089
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,806
psychological trauma breakdown. We don't

1090
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:00,826
recognize the environment around us and

1091
00:55:00,848 --> 00:55:01,690
it's scary.

1092
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:07,566
Makes sense. Makes sense. All right.

1093
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:10,302
From Bala. Nice presentation. I heard

1094
00:55:10,356 --> 00:55:13,962
Chris say entangled states are LOCC

1095
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:16,526
for a specific reference frame. Is this

1096
00:55:16,548 --> 00:55:19,586
entanglement unitary or is it related to

1097
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,730
the numbers of degrees of freedom?

1098
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,270
I think the quick answer would be both.

1099
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,512
If you have a complex system with many

1100
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:37,416
degrees of freedom, some can be

1101
00:55:37,438 --> 00:55:39,720
entangled while others aren't.

1102
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,312
It depends on what parts of the state

1103
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:48,012
are separable. So again,

1104
00:55:48,066 --> 00:55:50,350
entanglement is just a statement about

1105
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,472
components of a joint state that factor

1106
00:55:56,536 --> 00:55:57,500
or don't.

1107
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,384
So you can have a joint state that looks

1108
00:56:02,422 --> 00:56:06,976
separable along some dimensions, but in

1109
00:56:06,998 --> 00:56:09,184
other dimensions. The other big

1110
00:56:09,222 --> 00:56:11,732
complication here is that whether a

1111
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:14,276
state looks entangled depends on the

1112
00:56:14,298 --> 00:56:16,384
reference frames that you use to measure

1113
00:56:16,432 --> 00:56:20,964
it with. And if

1114
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,152
you pick entangled reference frames,

1115
00:56:23,216 --> 00:56:25,668
then what we ordinarily think of as

1116
00:56:25,754 --> 00:56:27,892
separable, as entangled states become

1117
00:56:27,946 --> 00:56:30,656
separable. So you can move entanglement

1118
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:31,270
around.

1119
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,756
Awesome. Okay, from Roland Rodriguez is

1120
00:56:37,778 --> 00:56:40,156
the discrete temporality only within the

1121
00:56:40,178 --> 00:56:42,540
context of a given holographic screen

1122
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,384
interface with time being bracketed

1123
00:56:45,432 --> 00:56:47,824
otherwise beyond interface systems, is

1124
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:51,360
continuity or discretion kept agnostic?

1125
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,000
I think if I understand the question

1126
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:01,524
correctly, it's yes. If I

1127
00:57:01,562 --> 00:57:04,676
don't draw any boundaries, I just have

1128
00:57:04,698 --> 00:57:08,244
the joint state, then the evolution is

1129
00:57:08,282 --> 00:57:11,636
unitary and in

1130
00:57:11,658 --> 00:57:16,104
a sense time plays no role. And if

1131
00:57:16,302 --> 00:57:19,928
unitary evolution is perfectly time

1132
00:57:20,014 --> 00:57:22,984
symmetric, so time actually drops out

1133
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:26,556
altogether. Awesome. So to

1134
00:57:26,578 --> 00:57:27,884
talk about time, we have to draw

1135
00:57:27,922 --> 00:57:30,716
boundaries. Awesome. Time must have a

1136
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:34,732
stop huxley. And I'll ask

1137
00:57:34,786 --> 00:57:37,460
one last question from the appropriately

1138
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,832
monikered question quanderer all

1139
00:57:40,886 --> 00:57:43,568
communication is abductive is a

1140
00:57:43,574 --> 00:57:45,536
sentiment that I've been using to

1141
00:57:45,558 --> 00:57:47,356
develop some arguments. Does that scan

1142
00:57:47,388 --> 00:57:50,976
for you? How do we connect what we're

1143
00:57:51,008 --> 00:57:52,612
discussing here with quantum to

1144
00:57:52,666 --> 00:57:54,260
abductive logic?

1145
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,390
Yeah,

1146
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,368
I could go along with that. I'd want a

1147
00:58:03,374 --> 00:58:04,330
lot more detail.

1148
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,364
All communication is essentially

1149
00:58:09,492 --> 00:58:11,752
analogical. I would agree with that.

1150
00:58:11,806 --> 00:58:14,840
Yes. Andrew?

1151
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,604
Yes. Thank you. So going back to the

1152
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:23,500
picture where the scattering picture?

1153
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,028
So we have so far everything is

1154
00:58:26,114 --> 00:58:29,760
topological and certainly

1155
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,176
induces breaking the boundary in

1156
00:58:32,198 --> 00:58:33,868
different sectors. I suppose it induces

1157
00:58:33,964 --> 00:58:37,776
a topology on the boundary. Now, I had a

1158
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:40,016
couple of questions as for the geometry,

1159
00:58:40,048 --> 00:58:41,590
and this might be getting ahead.

1160
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,372
Is it an emergent property of those

1161
00:58:46,426 --> 00:58:48,384
channels between different boundary

1162
00:58:48,432 --> 00:58:51,156
sectors? And if that's the case, then

1163
00:58:51,258 --> 00:58:53,216
what does it mean to have a QRF or

1164
00:58:53,258 --> 00:58:53,850
space?

1165
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,904
Yeah, this is really the topic for

1166
00:59:00,942 --> 00:59:05,196
September, but you

1167
00:59:05,218 --> 00:59:07,016
do point out the fact that it's

1168
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:08,136
something of a chicken and egg

1169
00:59:08,168 --> 00:59:11,950
situation. The way

1170
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,084
I think of it is, I suppose to choose

1171
00:59:15,122 --> 00:59:19,970
the chicken side and think about what

1172
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:24,208
kind of reference frame does the agent

1173
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:28,576
have to implement to

1174
00:59:28,678 --> 00:59:30,980
see space on their boundary.

1175
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,756
And the reason I think about it that way

1176
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:37,268
is that's a question? I want to be able

1177
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:39,844
to ask about biological systems. And

1178
00:59:39,882 --> 00:59:42,872
this actually gets into probably what

1179
00:59:42,926 --> 00:59:46,170
won't be talked about till October. But

1180
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:52,804
I want to be able to ask essentially

1181
00:59:52,852 --> 00:59:56,460
a phylogenetic question of what

1182
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,952
sorts of organisms, where in the lineage

1183
00:59:59,016 --> 01:00:03,628
from Luca do we

1184
01:00:03,714 --> 01:00:06,552
find systems that are able to assign

1185
01:00:06,616 --> 01:00:08,508
spatial coordinates to their boundaries

1186
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:11,712
and what coordinates come first? And I

1187
01:00:11,766 --> 01:00:16,336
suspect that sort

1188
01:00:16,358 --> 01:00:19,232
of discrete location names with no

1189
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:22,788
metric come first that

1190
01:00:22,874 --> 01:00:25,270
a system can talk about, for example,

1191
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,532
this part of their membrane versus that

1192
01:00:28,586 --> 01:00:31,060
part of their membrane without even

1193
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,284
having any ability to say, how far apart

1194
01:00:33,332 --> 01:00:36,904
they are and that some sort of

1195
01:00:36,942 --> 01:00:39,380
metric representation of this angular

1196
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:44,090
space comes later and that

1197
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:47,004
a radial space comes even later than

1198
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:49,212
that. That's, at this point,

1199
01:00:49,266 --> 01:00:50,924
speculation. But I think these are

1200
01:00:50,962 --> 01:00:53,070
questions that we can end up asking

1201
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,116
given the right kind of formalism and

1202
01:00:57,138 --> 01:00:59,250
the right understanding of what it means

1203
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,516
to be able to make a spatial

1204
01:01:01,548 --> 01:01:04,752
measurement. So the conjecture is that

1205
01:01:04,886 --> 01:01:07,724
the metric would emerge from a discrete

1206
01:01:07,772 --> 01:01:10,196
network metric of counting ticks sort of

1207
01:01:10,218 --> 01:01:13,236
thing. Yeah, I think that's correct.

1208
01:01:13,338 --> 01:01:16,996
And the sort of

1209
01:01:17,018 --> 01:01:20,292
symmetries of space that we see are very

1210
01:01:20,346 --> 01:01:23,016
much tied up with object identity. So if

1211
01:01:23,038 --> 01:01:27,124
we think about something like rotational

1212
01:01:27,172 --> 01:01:28,810
symmetry let's see,

1213
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,080
I should stop screen sharing.

1214
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,590
So I've got this object, right,

1215
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,332
and I can do this, and I say, oh, space

1216
01:01:45,386 --> 01:01:47,300
has this rotational symmetry.

1217
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,056
But for me to say that, I have to

1218
01:01:50,078 --> 01:01:52,040
recognize that this is the same object,

1219
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:55,240
right? I have to implement object

1220
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:57,944
persistence, which we all learn to do

1221
01:01:57,982 --> 01:02:00,010
when we're nine months old or something.

1222
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,140
But we tend to regard those as

1223
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:08,316
separate things as we

1224
01:02:08,338 --> 01:02:10,572
learn object persistence, because space

1225
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:13,408
is rotationally symmetric, but we can

1226
01:02:13,414 --> 01:02:15,184
view it the other way around, that space

1227
01:02:15,222 --> 01:02:19,040
is rotationally symmetric for me because

1228
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,896
I implement these constraints that are

1229
01:02:20,918 --> 01:02:22,480
called object persistence.

1230
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,564
Do you think we can understand

1231
01:02:26,682 --> 01:02:29,956
phylogenetics as a whole, as a

1232
01:02:29,978 --> 01:02:32,516
kind of scattering experiment, like the

1233
01:02:32,538 --> 01:02:35,796
high energy Leuka event and

1234
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:38,984
then dissipating and propagating in a

1235
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:41,240
very tangled bank?

1236
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,560
Well, I do want to be able to understand

1237
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,600
phylogeny in exactly the same terms as

1238
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:52,180
embryology, and Mike Levin and I have

1239
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:53,916
published papers about that. We should

1240
01:02:53,938 --> 01:02:56,364
be able to view the lineage of Luca in

1241
01:02:56,402 --> 01:02:59,676
exactly the same way that we view the

1242
01:02:59,698 --> 01:03:02,030
lineage of the Zygote that produced us.

1243
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,810
So that's why it's no coincidence that

1244
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,416
during pregnancy, the development of the

1245
01:03:10,438 --> 01:03:13,792
embryo mirrors evolution in terms of the

1246
01:03:13,846 --> 01:03:17,348
parts that are developed first. Yeah,

1247
01:03:17,434 --> 01:03:20,724
this is the old idea that phylogeny and

1248
01:03:20,762 --> 01:03:23,860
ontogeny are related in some way,

1249
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:26,224
which, from an embryonic development

1250
01:03:26,272 --> 01:03:29,064
point of view, they're certainly

1251
01:03:29,102 --> 01:03:30,810
analogous in ways.

1252
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,304
Sorry, if I may ask one last question,

1253
01:03:35,422 --> 01:03:38,436
things should be very quick regarding

1254
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,376
the weak rotation. I'm still a bit

1255
01:03:40,398 --> 01:03:44,344
unsure how it ties to this diagrammatic

1256
01:03:44,392 --> 01:03:46,696
notation that we had with quantum

1257
01:03:46,728 --> 01:03:48,590
channels on show so on.

1258
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,584
In the second session, we briefly talked

1259
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:58,176
about the weak rotation being

1260
01:03:58,358 --> 01:04:00,496
a reversal in the direction of time. Is

1261
01:04:00,518 --> 01:04:02,960
there any relation to today's session?

1262
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,630
Yeah,

1263
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,156
whenever we think about the

1264
01:04:13,338 --> 01:04:16,884
flow of time as driven by

1265
01:04:16,922 --> 01:04:21,016
the input output cycle the

1266
01:04:21,038 --> 01:04:24,532
input output cycle? For agents separated

1267
01:04:24,596 --> 01:04:28,184
by a boundary, there's always a

1268
01:04:28,222 --> 01:04:30,844
sign change. Right. My input is your

1269
01:04:30,882 --> 01:04:35,884
output, and vice versa. So when

1270
01:04:35,922 --> 01:04:40,184
we think about the bob's

1271
01:04:40,232 --> 01:04:42,540
clock ticking, when Alice does

1272
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:43,230
something,

1273
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,904
his direction of time,

1274
01:04:49,942 --> 01:04:52,352
in a sense, points with respect to the

1275
01:04:52,406 --> 01:04:54,720
boundary opposite to hers,

1276
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,724
but that's only with respect to the

1277
01:04:58,762 --> 01:05:02,544
boundary. He sees information flowing

1278
01:05:02,592 --> 01:05:05,270
in, and she sees information flowing in.

1279
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,332
That's the only point being made here

1280
01:05:09,386 --> 01:05:12,980
about the WIC rotation as an operation.

1281
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,940
Thank you. Thank you, Chris.

1282
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,592
Very well appreciated by the viewers

1283
01:05:21,656 --> 01:05:24,444
and by us. So we'll certainly look

1284
01:05:24,482 --> 01:05:27,836
forward to reviewing the q a, and

1285
01:05:27,938 --> 01:05:30,284
