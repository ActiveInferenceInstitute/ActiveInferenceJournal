1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,460
foreign

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,740
welcome everyone this is physics as

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,440
information processing session 4 on

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,079
communicating observers it's the 10th of

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,180
August 2023

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,340
Chris looking forward to this lecture

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,039
off to you

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,920
uh thank you Daniel and uh welcome to

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,000
this session

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,980
uh as Daniel said this is about

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,859
communicating observers and fastening

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,780
your seat belts because we have a lot to

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,420
cover in the next hour

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,899
oh so just to do a quick review we've

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,180
been talking about uh Quantum

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,460
information Theory and we've been

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,200
talking about it in the simplest

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,000
possible setting

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,440
of uh two systems Alice and Bob that

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,600
exchange information through their

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,219
Mutual boundary

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,800
and we've assumed that everything is

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,320
finite dimensional so we don't need to

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,660
worry about infinite energy transfer

25
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,760
across this boundary

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,220
and of course we assume conservation of

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,500
energy so there are no sources or sinks

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,159
uh in either the systems Alice and Bob

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,060
and we emphasize that this way of uh

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,280
depicting things is topological we're

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,979
not assuming any background geometry no

32
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,140
sort of spatial embedding which is going

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,820
to become very important in this session

34
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,619
um in the last session we talked about

35
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,280
how the boundary which I'll always call

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,299
B

37
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,420
it can be thought of as a channel that

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,479
comprises in qubits that are independent

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,680
and Alice and Bob each can prepare and

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,479
measure those qubits

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,299
and they can always choose independently

42
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,759
their reference frames for doing so so

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,520
how they Define up and down when they're

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,200
measuring a spin

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,220
with effectively a z-spin operator to to

46
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,820
interact with these qubits

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,799
we talked a little bit about the free

48
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,660
energy principle in its Quantum

49
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,459
formulation

50
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,980
and the principle basically says that

51
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,680
interacting systems will behave in a way

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,739
that aligns their reference frames

53
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,959
and that they therefore asymptotically

54
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,379
approach entanglement so the fep is a

55
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,879
classical limited the principle of

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,080
unitarity

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,599
and that's one reason for studying

58
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,060
Quantum information to learn more about

59
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,620
the fep

60
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,660
and so to learn more about active

61
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,060
inference and what the theory of active

62
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,019
inference says about agents

63
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,980
and last time we talked a lot about

64
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,980
the constraints that are imposed by a

65
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,459
limited free energy Supply on any agent

66
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,340
uh recall that we talked about the fact

67
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,920
that in the absence of sources of free

68
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,180
energy

69
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,599
uh within an agent

70
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,640
so as long as you conserve energy

71
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,640
globally that the free energy that each

72
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,040
agent uses has to come from its

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,560
environment that's clearly true for us

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,500
we have to consume oxygen and eat food

75
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,659
and things like that to keep running as

76
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,060
systems

77
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,340
and we discussed a little bit this

78
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,480
theorem

79
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,680
that if two reference frames or Quantum

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,819
processes q1 and Q2 don't commute

81
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,700
they have to be implemented by

82
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,420
compartments that communicate

83
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,159
classically and we'll use this

84
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,080
extensively today

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,599
uh but the bottom line last time was

86
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,299
that physics alone gives us

87
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:46,620
compartmentalization in systems whenever

88
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,840
the systems are complex enough to have

89
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,959
multiple kinds of measurements that they

90
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,640
can't deploy simultaneously

91
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,319
so where we're going

92
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,739
uh today we're going to

93
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,920
start from this place we left off last

94
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,400
time of the possibility of agents that

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,500
are compartmentalized

96
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,080
and into compartments that have to

97
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,120
communicate classically

98
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,639
so we're going to talk about agents that

99
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,040
can be compartmentalized into multiple

100
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,340
sub-agents that share an environment the

101
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,220
environment consisting of Bob

102
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,460
and how those agents talk about that

103
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,560
shared environment

104
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,500
so the motivation for this is simple

105
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,440
it's that what we do all the time is a

106
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,180
group activity and what we're doing

107
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,340
right now is a group activity that

108
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,919
involves sharing an environment what's

109
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,440
shown on this screen and talking about

110
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,919
it and

111
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:52,380
the whole post session discussion

112
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,680
process will be another example of just

113
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,060
that sort of thing

114
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,900
so to to talk about science at all or to

115
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,940
talk about any kind of social relations

116
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,979
or to talk about anything other than

117
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,419
solipsism

118
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,820
we have to be able to talk about how

119
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
multiple agents communicate about some

120
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,560
shared environment

121
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,180
and so that's what we're going to

122
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,660
develop a formal way of talking about

123
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,479
and there are two things to notice right

124
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,440
off the top about this

125
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,660
one is that the way we've defined

126
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,520
interactions of boundaries they're

127
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,759
effectively instantaneous so each agent

128
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,960
remember

129
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,479
interacts with its boundary with some

130
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,759
set of operators and what those

131
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,759
operators do is effectively measure each

132
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,220
operator effectively measures the spin

133
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,600
of a qubit

134
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,199
so this is a very fast process

135
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,340
I'll

136
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,020
the other thing

137
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,600
that we then need to notice

138
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,740
is that if we have two agents

139
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,720
and they're communicating with each

140
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,600
other classically

141
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,180
then they're going to be using degrees

142
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,820
of freedom of their shared environment

143
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,400
in order to communicate and that's

144
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,680
exactly what we're doing right now for

145
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,380
example we're using degrees of freedom

146
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,120
of the internet

147
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,539
to communicate I'm using degrees of

148
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,699
freedom in the local atmosphere to talk

149
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,500
to my microphone

150
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,840
and I'm using degrees of freedom of the

151
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,100
local Photon field to see my screen

152
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,300
so

153
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,380
all communication between agents and

154
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,120
certainly all classical communication

155
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,360
between agents uses degrees of freedom

156
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,039
of the environment and the environment

157
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,460
remember is the other system Bob that's

158
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,380
on the other side of that shared

159
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,819
boundary

160
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,100
so we're going to be interested in how

161
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,940
components of Alice use Bob as a

162
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,740
communication Channel and in fact as

163
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,900
multiple communication channels

164
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,139
and I just wanted to to quote my

165
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,300
colleague and friend Mike Levin

166
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,280
in his statement that all intelligence

167
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,759
is composite all of us all organisms

168
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,100
even single cells

169
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,660
are composite systems that comprise many

170
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,599
many different agents that are able to

171
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,599
make different kinds of measurements and

172
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,360
execute different kinds of actions and

173
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,060
so have to communicate classically

174
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,699
so we're we're talking about all of life

175
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,819
here as well as all of social systems

176
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,380
and ecosystems and such things as that

177
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,740
so the first thing I want to do today is

178
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,319
simplify the notation

179
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,720
uh so that we don't have to draw quite

180
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,539
such complicated diagrams so the picture

181
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,580
on the left here is a picture from the

182
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,000
last session it shows the structure of a

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,720
very simple agent that makes some

184
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,699
measurements using a reference frame

185
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,139
called e

186
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,840
and then writes some results of those

187
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,660
measurements to memory using a reference

188
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,400
frame called y

189
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,860
and those two processes are connected by

190
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,460
an internal clock that ticks uh between

191
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,099
the the input process and the output

192
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,319
process and the the clock tick

193
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,479
corresponds to the expenditure of free

194
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,539
energy to write information irreversibly

195
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,919
on the boundary

196
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,259
so the the memories are actually written

197
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,000
on the boundary because that's where

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,860
classical information lives in this

199
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,700
Theory

200
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,399
so you can think of this whole process

201
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,159
from E through the clock and back to Y

202
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,520
as a single Quantum process or as a

203
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,980
Quantum computation that Maps some

204
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,500
sector e of the boundary to some sector

205
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,500
y of the boundary and so we can

206
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,660
represent it in this much simpler way

207
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,600
that's over on the right side as some

208
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,279
process Q

209
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,519
that Maps some sector on the boundary to

210
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,620
some other sector on the boundary

211
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,800
and formally that process can be thought

212
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,160
of as a topological Quantum field Theory

213
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,800
uh topological here is important it's

214
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,200
not geometric it doesn't assume an

215
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,480
embedding in space and this will become

216
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,899
critically important uh later on

217
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,040
and

218
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,300
the operation of that uh

219
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,320
pqft requires a clock tick or it

220
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,060
incorporates a tick of this internal

221
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,440
clock

222
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,519
and we can do this uh because we were

223
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,140
able to prove Jim glasberg and and to

224
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,360
Nino Marciano and I were able to approve

225
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,440
last year

226
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,959
that we can always represent a Quantum

227
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,660
reference frame as a topological Quantum

228
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,240
field Theory and this just illustrates

229
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,779
the two kinds of Transformations between

230
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:59,279
uh Quantum reference frames that are

231
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,380
important we can take one and divide it

232
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,740
into two pieces that commute

233
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,160
or we can take uh

234
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,060
a two-part reference frame and we can

235
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,839
swap in uh another part

236
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,180
that doesn't commute with the part that

237
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,980
we've swapped it in for but that does

238
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,019
commute with the remainder of the

239
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,140
reference frame so here R is the

240
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,440
reference component of some object

241
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,540
identification system

242
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,660
and we can

243
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,220
swap in some different way of looking at

244
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,740
the object once we've identified it so

245
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,080
for example if the the object that we're

246
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,019
identifying is a box that can measure

247
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:43,940
both

248
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,060
z-spin and X spin then p and Q can be

249
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,000
the z-span and X spin settings on that

250
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,959
box

251
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,720
that allow us to to effectively rotate

252
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,899
the filter from this way to that way so

253
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,540
that we measure vertical spin versus for

254
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,040
horizontal spin

255
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,380
and that's really it I mean those are

256
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,860
the the ways that one can transform uh

257
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,959
what a reference frames of course we

258
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,120
could do arbitrarily many compositions

259
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,920
of this kind of transformation to do

260
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,260
something very complicated but they map

261
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,680
very simply to tqfts with the structure

262
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,300
and

263
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,880
um you can construct categories out of

264
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,620
this and find a functor that's well

265
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,720
defined at Mass one category to another

266
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,180
so it's a it's an example of an issues

267
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,480
of categorial categorical techniques

268
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,700
for solving a problem that looks

269
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,740
difficult but in fact it's it's very

270
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,360
straightforward

271
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,519
so

272
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,060
using this simplified notation

273
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,420
um it becomes very easy to see

274
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,320
uh that if we have two systems Alice and

275
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,380
Bob on opposite sides of this boundary

276
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,100
and we perfectly align their Quantum

277
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,380
reference frames

278
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,019
which is what the fep says they will

279
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,000
tend to do

280
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,700
then they become entangled

281
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,920
and you can see that they're entangled

282
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,740
by seeing that once the reference frames

283
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,100
are perfectly aligned they jointly

284
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,480
Implement one Quantum process

285
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,060
um and jointly implementing one Quantum

286
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,420
process just means you're entangled of

287
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,720
the two sides no longer have

288
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,620
um

289
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,140
conditionally independent states

290
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,200
if one Quantum process which is time

291
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,140
reversible information preserving

292
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,019
is implemented jointly by the two

293
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,360
systems

294
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,600
so a lot of things like this become very

295
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,480
simple when we think of

296
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,680
of these processes as just Quantum

297
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,860
computations going on inside some system

298
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,440
implemented by some system

299
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,860
and how those processes relate across

300
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,560
some boundary so that's what we're going

301
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,440
to do for

302
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,880
studying communication

303
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,339
today

304
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,700
another thing to recall from a couple of

305
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,579
sessions ago or last session

306
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:24,540
is that if two reference frames q1 and

307
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,700
Q2 commute

308
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,079
we can always join them together to form

309
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,240
a single reference frame and this is

310
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,079
just a graphical depiction in this

311
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,200
simpler language of how that works

312
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,480
and

313
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,740
topologically there's no distinction

314
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,940
between

315
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,220
the left side and the right side what

316
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,560
I've done is just squeeze the top two

317
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,480
green circles together and the bottom

318
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,519
two green circles together into one

319
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,620
Circle

320
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,779
and that just makes a simple process

321
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,380
connecting the top one to the bottom one

322
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,700
so what we're going to be interested in

323
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,120
is situations where this doesn't happen

324
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,279
uh where

325
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,940
Alice consists of two components

326
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,300
that execute reference frames that don't

327
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,740
commute

328
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,980
and so the two components

329
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,639
are conditionally independent they do

330
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,000
each have free choice of reference frame

331
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,220
and so they have to communicate

332
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,899
classically they don't share a Quant a

333
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,120
single Quantum process so they're not

334
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,040
entangled

335
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,480
and before we go ahead to do that

336
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,500
I just wanted to remind you of some of

337
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,680
the no-go theorems that follow from this

338
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,880
situation

339
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,820
uh depicted on the right where we have a

340
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,139
single agent executing a single

341
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:00,660
reference frame a single process a

342
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,699
single kind of measurement

343
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,579
uh any set of commuting measurements

344
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,199
that can be combined into one

345
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,160
measurement

346
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,620
and here's some things Alice can't do

347
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,600
and we've talked about some of these

348
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,980
previously

349
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,980
um so this is basically a reminder

350
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,320
but I'll

351
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,279
Alice can't using just one measurement

352
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,279
measure the entanglement entropy across

353
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,839
her own boundary

354
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,420
so Alice can't know that she has an

355
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,820
independent state she can't know that

356
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,760
she's not entangled with Bob

357
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,740
and that's that's a useful thing to

358
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,920
think about philosophically uh as as it

359
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,100
applies to you and me we can't actually

360
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,279
know that we have independent states

361
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,800
uh Alice can't measure her own

362
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,779
entanglement interview

363
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,660
so she can't know whether she has

364
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,639
components that have to communicate

365
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,440
classically

366
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,680
uh she can't measure Bob's entanglement

367
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,860
entropy so she can't know whether Bob

368
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,720
has compartments that have to

369
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,940
communicate classically

370
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,920
and if you think in terms of perception

371
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,160
Theory this says Alice can't know

372
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,399
whether Bob consists of separate objects

373
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,740
that behave classically

374
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,240
oh

375
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,240
their behavior can look classical to her

376
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,940
but she's not able to determine that

377
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,760
their behavior is classical because she

378
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,399
can't uh measure Bob's entanglement

379
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,920
entropy

380
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,019
she can't measure the dimension of of

381
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,180
her own boundary

382
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,120
and recall from a couple of times ago

383
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,060
that the boundary includes some sector

384
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,459
that supplies free energy

385
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,920
that Alice can't extract information

386
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,680
from for further processing she can only

387
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,959
extract free energy from

388
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,079
so she can't measure the dimension of

389
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,399
that sector

390
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,800
and so she can't measure the dimension

391
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,020
of the whole boundary itself

392
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,819
and this of course means that she can't

393
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,220
measure her own Dimension either and of

394
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,079
course she can't measure Bob's Dimension

395
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,419
because the only information she can

396
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,160
about get about Bob is the classical

397
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,020
information that's encoded on this

398
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,179
boundary if you can't reach past the

399
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,520
boundary to see how large a system Bob

400
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,839
is

401
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,619
and that's clearly connected to this

402
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,359
first point that you can't measure the

403
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,760
entanglement entry across Bob because

404
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,679
the entanglement attribute can only be

405
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,260
small if her dimension in Bob's

406
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,240
Dimension are both much larger than the

407
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,220
dimension of the boundary so that's a

408
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,419
condition she can't check

409
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,980
um so all of these kind of no-go

410
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,380
theorems lead off an interesting Direct

411
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,360
s and the only one that we're really

412
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,120
going to be interested in here

413
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,020
um

414
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,539
is uh the third one the one about

415
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,460
measuring Bob's entanglement entropy

416
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,860
because we want to talk specifically

417
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,580
about how multiple agents so multiple

418
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,160
components of Alice can access

419
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,679
information about Bob's entanglement

420
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,280
entropy

421
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,140
okay so recall from the end of the last

422
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,280
session

423
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,500
that the last thing we talked about was

424
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,960
classical communication

425
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,120
and we talked about the fact that

426
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,280
classical communication involves

427
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,919
assumptions and pitfalls and that we

428
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,020
have to be very careful whenever we talk

429
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,460
about it

430
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,799
and what we're going to do today is

431
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,620
standard practice in physics we're

432
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,660
simply going to stipulate

433
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,340
that these components A1 and A2 the

434
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,080
separable components of Alice

435
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,120
communicate classically and so we're

436
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,620
going to draw out like this we're going

437
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,679
to draw a classical Channel between them

438
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,720
and that classical Channel passes

439
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,480
through Bob it uses degrees of freedom

440
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,120
of the ambient Photon field or the

441
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,360
ambient atmosphere or pieces of paper or

442
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,179
email or something like that that's out

443
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,039
there in the environment to exchange

444
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,620
classical messages

445
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,179
and there are a couple of things to note

446
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,460
here uh I haven't even written down here

447
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,160
we're assuming that A1 and A2 share some

448
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,320
language this classical communication

449
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,299
that's a big assumption as we talked

450
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,820
about last time

451
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,039
um but I will note explicitly that

452
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,140
classical communication takes time

453
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,679
that's what defines classicality here

454
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,100
it's causal so it can't work faster than

455
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,600
the speed of light

456
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,720
uh this is a topological Theory we don't

457
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,179
have any vetting geometry so we can't at

458
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,880
this point talk about light which is a

459
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,160
relationship between space and time

460
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,740
because we've got time we've got clocks

461
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,960
but we don't have any space

462
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,559
but we can say that whatever passes

463
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,380
through this classical Channel requires

464
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,120
at least one clock tick on Bob's side so

465
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,799
it's a process that Bob has to execute

466
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,740
and executing that process takes time so

467
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,640
getting

468
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,760
uh the signal from me to you on the

469
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,280
internet takes some time so the

470
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,740
environment's clock has to tick during

471
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,000
that

472
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,820
and all of these assumptions bundle

473
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,299
together turn out to be a fairly serious

474
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,360
set of assumptions and they involve

475
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,299
assumptions about fine-tuning about the

476
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,320
universe being just right

477
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,840
and uh they should make us nervous and I

478
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,539
just want to leave it at that we always

479
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,900
assume with complete a plum that agents

480
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,120
can communicate classically but it's not

481
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,160
a straightforward assumption and it's

482
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,679
worth any of you are looking at for

483
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,679
interesting uh research projects can

484
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,600
look into the nature of classical

485
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,179
communication it's full of hidden

486
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,179
assumptions and surprises and things

487
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,919
that aren't at all straightforward even

488
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,080
though they look like they ought to be

489
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,020
so there's a challenge

490
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,059
so why do we Ascend this why do we

491
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,820
assume class communication we do it

492
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,919
because we have to if we're going to

493
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:19,940
talk about detecting entanglement

494
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,539
and

495
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,340
um

496
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,740
most of you probably know the history of

497
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,380
of the notion of entanglement it was

498
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,960
first noticed by Einstein podolsky and

499
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,539
Rosen uh Ever After called epr in 1935

500
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,820
and they wrote a paper which is Infamous

501
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,720
uh and called the epr paper

502
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,360
in which they argued that the phenomenon

503
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,460
of entanglement made no sense and

504
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,039
couldn't possibly be physical

505
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,980
and since quantum theory included this

506
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,400
Con this this notion of entanglement uh

507
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,559
it could possibly be a complete theory

508
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,720
of what's going on in the world

509
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,900
and Schrodinger uh replied the same year

510
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,679
with a very detailed paper where it

511
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,419
introduces among other things

512
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,299
Schrodinger's cat as a paradox

513
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,039
and he explains very clearly what

514
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,380
entanglement is and why entanglement

515
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,039
follows from quantum theory and he uses

516
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,140
that discussion to argue that the

517
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,780
classical notion of a physical state is

518
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,059
not actually applicable to the world as

519
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:30,120
it is so he answers the epr paper very

520
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,100
directly

521
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,840
and

522
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,580
of this discussion of

523
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,980
is currently most mostly known as the

524
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,320
boar Einstein debate because of course

525
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,460
Bohr

526
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,820
already in 1928 has said had said in

527
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,280
print that the classical notion of

528
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,260
causality in space and time simply

529
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,480
doesn't apply anymore

530
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,780
and Einstein objected to that vigorously

531
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,380
but that was 1935 and it was almost 50

532
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,780
years later that entanglement was first

533
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,659
observed in the laboratory here the 1982

534
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,940
picture is a picture of the interior of

535
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,520
Allen s that's Laboratory

536
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,260
uh when he performed the first

537
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,900
entanglement experiment for which uh he

538
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,740
finally won the Nobel Prize last year

539
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,620
and uh these days this kind of

540
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,400
experiment is done all over the world

541
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,620
and is even done with satellite-borne

542
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,158
sources

543
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,080
Ian resource

544
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,039
is the key to Quantum security Quantum

545
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,380
secured communication as we'll discuss

546
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,740
in Quantum cryptography and Quantum

547
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,559
banking the Quantum Internet all this

548
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,320
other stuff that you may have heard of

549
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,100
so uh before talking more about

550
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,900
these experiments I just want to uh

551
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,440
provide a definition of entanglement

552
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,659
uh entangled

553
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:07,020
simply means not separable that's the

554
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,280
definition

555
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,640
so a state a joint State Abe is

556
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,280
entangled if and only if it does not

557
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,659
Factor

558
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:20,340
into two separable states

559
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,700
and that's it that's the definition

560
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,679
and

561
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,140
the literature and especially the

562
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,600
popular literature are is absolutely

563
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,780
Rife with hype and various kinds of

564
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,539
misdurification of entanglement and and

565
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,760
authors trying to convince you that

566
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,220
entanglement is this

567
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,200
amazing uh kind of woo-woo thing

568
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,419
and whenever you run across that go back

569
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,120
to the definition I mean entanglement

570
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,900
simply means uh this simple mathematical

571
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,020
condition of not

572
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,520
separability or a state that isn't

573
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,200
factorizable

574
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,780
and that means that the state does not

575
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,460
display classical conditional

576
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,400
Independence so classically that's the

577
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,380
way to think about it it's a failure of

578
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,179
conditional Independence

579
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,640
and it's it's ubiquitous in quantum

580
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,200
theory even though it wasn't actually

581
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,720
observed for almost 50 years after it

582
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,179
was predicted

583
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:23,760
so here's what all these experiments

584
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,679
look like they're called Bell epr

585
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,940
experiments after John Bell uh who

586
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,700
derived the statistical Criterion for

587
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,380
detecting entanglement

588
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,340
and epr Einstein panelski and Rosen who

589
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,380
did this as a thought experiment and

590
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,779
said if this this occurs and the theory

591
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,880
it can't possibly be real and of course

592
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,000
it is real uh as now amply demonstrated

593
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,039
by experimentation

594
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,919
here's how they work there's a source

595
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,400
The Source produces a state that's that

596
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,640
is entangled and I've I've written the

597
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,740
typical uh what's called a bell State

598
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,460
it's up plus or minus down divided by

599
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,260
the square root of 2 just to normalize

600
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,100
it

601
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,400
but up plus or minus down is clearly not

602
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,520
the same as up times down so this is not

603
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,559
a separable stay

604
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,440
and this state propagates outward in

605
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,240
space and time

606
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,520
to two observers who have independent

607
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,220
Laboratories uh for example on different

608
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,620
continents in that space-based

609
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,299
experiment that I showed you the picture

610
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,580
of from the cover of science a few years

611
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,580
ago 2017 I think

612
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,760
the two observers have freedom to choose

613
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,620
their own reference frame their own

614
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,140
z-axis for measuring spin

615
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,240
they do a spin measurement

616
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,340
and they do this over and over and over

617
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,039
again they accumulate statistics

618
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,039
and they exchange their results so that

619
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,580
they can analyze the joint statistics of

620
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,100
their experiment and they check to see

621
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,260
whether that joint statistics is

622
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,000
consistent with classical probability

623
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,140
Theory

624
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,059
and if it isn't

625
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:09,919
uh to a statistically significant level

626
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,960
then they've been able to detect

627
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,760
entanglement

628
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,419
though notice that this process requires

629
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,220
classical communication

630
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,320
they have to make their independent

631
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,360
measurements in their own Laboratories

632
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,059
and then they have to exchange results

633
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,520
or one of them has to send results to

634
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,500
the other one or they both have to send

635
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,840
their results to some third party

636
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,600
but in all of these cases they're

637
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,960
exchanging some classical data and so we

638
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,460
have the assumption

639
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,860
that whoever gets that classical data

640
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,740
knows the language it was recorded in

641
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,460
and so can do a joint analysis

642
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,440
so I'll just show you another picture of

643
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,440
this experiment that's in a standard

644
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,140
space-time diagram here time is vertical

645
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,539
space is horizontal

646
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:01,980
of

647
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,500
the two observers are labeled Alice and

648
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,000
Bob

649
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,480
they share a Quantum channel that goes

650
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,059
from Alice to the source to Bob that's

651
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,159
the entangled state

652
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,640
they do some processing and then one of

653
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,059
them here Bob sends the results to Alice

654
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:24,299
and that's a classical communication it

655
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:25,679
takes time

656
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,620
and it traverses space

657
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,279
so this step is classical so this is why

658
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,900
we have to assume classical

659
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,620
communication to talk about detecting or

660
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,200
using entanglement

661
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,840
so now I want to represent this in a

662
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,460
different way

663
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,940
uh using our little picture earlier

664
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,460
we're going to think of Alice again as

665
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,039
two components A1 and A2

666
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,500
they're separable so they have to

667
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,020
communicate classically they have a

668
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,720
classical channel that goes through Bob

669
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,419
and they also now share some Quantum

670
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:06,659
Channel they share an entangled state

671
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,580
and the entangled state of course is

672
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,340
produced by Bob the source is part of

673
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,419
Bob

674
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:16,020
and their detectors if you want to think

675
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,299
about it that way are located on this

676
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,620
boundary B

677
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,720
or they're interfaced with the sources

678
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,760
on this boundary V

679
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,179
and each of them executes a process

680
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,059
that accumulates data from the quantum

681
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,520
Channel and communicates it to the other

682
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,580
Observer via the classical chat

683
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,159
now this picture illustrates what's

684
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,460
called a lock protocol lock means local

685
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,940
operations and classical communication

686
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,600
so A1 and A2 are each operating locally

687
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,640
on their boundary they're making

688
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,340
measurements locally on their boundary

689
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,760
and they're communicating via actions

690
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,740
locally on their boundary and

691
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,840
observations locally on their boundary

692
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,140
so for example

693
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,480
I'm communicating with my computer here

694
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,080
we can consider it my boundary and stuff

695
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,000
is happening in the environment

696
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,460
that's implemented by the internet

697
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,380
and you're receiving those

698
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,100
Communications locally on your boundary

699
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,440
on your laptop or whatever it is you're

700
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,340
using

701
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,820
so that's what local operations means

702
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,080
and

703
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,659
these protocols specifically involve

704
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:32,760
classical communication and so they're

705
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,580
able to detect entanglement in a bell

706
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,279
epr experiment is just an example of a

707
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,779
lock protocol

708
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:43,559
uh The Observers exchange information

709
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,539
about how they're going to do their

710
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:46,980
experiments they're both going to

711
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,200
measure D spend they're going to use

712
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,120
independently chosen reference frames

713
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,860
and they're going to look at the output

714
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,559
from some agreed upon source

715
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,860
so that's all classically set up

716
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,779
then they they actually make their

717
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,820
observations and then they classically

718
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,279
communicate their results so classical

719
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,820
communication front and back

720
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,899
lot Protocols are not limited to this

721
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,720
sort of of

722
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,820
Bell epr sort of setting

723
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,340
we can also represent a scattering

724
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,940
experiment as a lock protocol

725
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,500
so

726
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,399
um

727
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,860
here's a representation of scattering as

728
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,200
a lock protocol and you can see all I've

729
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,159
done

730
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,899
is uh cut that previous boundary

731
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:41,159
at the division between 81 and A2 and

732
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,580
I've then extended it in some external

733
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,460
time some

734
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,240
um the time that is

735
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,520
counted by Bob's clock not by Alice's

736
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,960
clock

737
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,899
that's what's meant by external

738
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:02,100
and I've relabeled Alice II as Alice 1

739
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,520
at a later time so now what Alice is

740
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,620
doing is communicating with her past

741
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,360
self

742
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,880
or A1 is communicating with her future

743
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,500
self

744
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,539
and they're each doing something

745
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:20,580
different uh A1 is is executing a

746
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,220
procedure that in the laboratory we call

747
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,559
State preparation

748
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,140
she's preparing a state that we'll call

749
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,600
in

750
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,399
which is just the initial state of some

751
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,100
scattering experiment so for example

752
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,260
at the LHC

753
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,159
uh in is some state of two protons that

754
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,440
are quartering around the ring and tlhc

755
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,679
at close to the speed of light

756
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,240
and uh Alice then later on at t plus

757
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,799
delta T

758
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,140
is doing a different kind of quantum

759
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,140
process she's uh analyzing the data

760
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,120
coming out of something like the atlas

761
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,320
detector

762
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,860
which is a multi-particle uh counter

763
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,620
that's located at the LHC

764
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,200
so they share a Quantum Channel

765
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,140
which is the scattering channel that

766
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,539
takes the incoming State and produces

767
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:17,700
the outgoing state

768
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,240
and I'll recall from the very first

769
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,419
session as as Feynman told us

770
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,179
to understand this transition from in to

771
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,940
out we have to integrate over all

772
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,940
possible paths that are consistent with

773
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,200
conservation of of

774
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:39,240
spin helicity basically momentum plus

775
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,720
spin

776
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,220
all the different spins that are

777
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,019
relevant in a high energy physics

778
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,240
experiment including things like lepton

779
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,440
number which is basically a spin

780
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,019
now how do we know how do we know what

781
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,820
we have to conserve

782
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,299
we know what we have to conserve because

783
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:02,340
Alice is doing the experiment has a

784
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,200
classical memory

785
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,500
that allows her to remember what she

786
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,500
prepared she can remember that what she

787
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,260
did you know back in the past

788
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,139
was set to protons counter rotating in

789
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,699
the LHC

790
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:20,159
and they had certain energies and so

791
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,020
they had certain momentum and they were

792
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,940
protons so they had certain spin

793
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,960
variables

794
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,899
uh all of that has to be remembered to

795
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,839
make any sense of the output of the

796
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:32,520
detectors

797
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,219
and so to actually

798
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:38,639
come up with a measured state that makes

799
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,379
sense

800
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,980
and very often this this memory channel

801
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,820
is neglected by physicists and I'm going

802
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,440
to pause here and let Andrew ask a

803
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,300
question

804
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,359
uh thank you Chris uh so does this imply

805
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,480
that every time you have a log channel

806
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,260
the quantum part is a like a scattering

807
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,240
picture like a unitary Evolution even in

808
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,820
the earlier epr picture is that Quantum

809
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,339
Channel portion always a unitary

810
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,380
Evolution scattering picture

811
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,520
thank you um

812
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,040
yes for

813
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,000
essentially the reason that uh

814
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,980
Define the class classical Channel

815
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,060
you're always assuming you have

816
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,140
something that's protected from

817
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,200
decoherence by the environment

818
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,540
so uh

819
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,420
yeah if you're doing an epr experiment

820
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,940
you have to assume that you don't have

821
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,880
any environmental decoherence between

822
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,520
the source and the detectors

823
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,400
and similarly when you're doing a

824
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,160
scattering experiment uh you have to

825
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,280
make the assumption that the environment

826
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,680
is not reaching in there and messing

827
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,740
with uh the outgoing state that you're

828
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,960
going to see or reaching in and messing

829
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,880
with the incoming State and changing it

830
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,000
in some way that re-prepares it

831
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,460
uh in a way that you don't know that you

832
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,200
have no knowledge of

833
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,599
so yes you're you're making a fairly

834
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,420
strong anti-decoherence assumption in in

835
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,800
any of these settings when you're

836
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,300
talking about having a Quantum Channel

837
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,099
does that does that answer the question

838
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:23,460
uh yeah thank you okay great

839
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,140
so we can think of we can think of lock

840
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,359
we can think of scattering as lock

841
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,078
of

842
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,660
and I I just wanted to now emphasize

843
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,900
that effectively what Locke is

844
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,020
implementing is two parallel memories a

845
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,060
classical memory

846
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,980
which as we said in the case of

847
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,520
scattering is memory for Preparation the

848
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,220
pr case it's memory for

849
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,500
preparation for what the experimental

850
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,320
setup is for what the instructions for

851
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,780
doing the experiment are

852
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,619
and we also have a Quantum Channel which

853
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:07,619
is effectively another memory it's

854
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:10,980
something that's extended Through Time

855
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,140
and again it's implemented by the

856
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,960
environment implemented by Bob and it

857
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,560
involves Bob's clock ticking

858
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,300
so

859
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,119
whenever we have two memories in

860
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,500
parallel

861
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,720
we can construct an error correcting

862
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,880
code so think of a simple classical

863
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,220
error correcting code

864
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,460
for example the use of parity bits

865
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,000
uh in exchanging Digital Data so if I

866
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,780
send you a bit string classically

867
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,599
and I send it to you two or three times

868
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,960
uh so there's some redundancy in my

869
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,040
signal

870
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,500
and I send you a parity bit

871
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,380
I say Okay add up your bit string and

872
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,020
the result should be one it's it's one

873
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,859
on my side uh if you've added up and you

874
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,200
get zero there's an error someplace

875
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,480
you can use that parody bit to detect

876
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,720
errors so you can throw out the

877
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,180
the bit strings that you receive that

878
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,940
have parity zero and say oh the

879
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,940
environment uh interfered somehow with

880
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,680
the signal or some eavesdropper

881
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,300
interfered with the signal that made a

882
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,579
mistake or something like that so this

883
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:24,740
corresponds

884
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,200
uh to environmental decoherence not

885
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,119
being a good assumption even though it's

886
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,280
classical environmental interference is

887
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,579
not a good assumption in this case

888
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,099
so a Quantum error correcting code is

889
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:41,520
basically the same idea I use some

890
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,960
feature

891
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,480
of the fact that I have two different

892
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,359
memories

893
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:53,160
and that uh I'm encoding something in

894
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,700
time I'm encoding multiple replicants of

895
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,859
something in time

896
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:02,099
to provide a way of checking to make

897
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:04,260
sure that I'm sending the correct

898
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,599
message

899
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,420
so uh I can

900
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,099
for example

901
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,619
consider the message to be my classical

902
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,359
memory

903
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,359
and consider the quantum process

904
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:22,200
as a process that tests that memory

905
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,180
so I remember that I need to do

906
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,780
experiment X and I will get result y

907
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,320
I actually do experiment X on this CL on

908
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,420
this Quantum Channel and see if I get

909
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,680
result y

910
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,940
uh

911
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,280
and if I don't get result y then

912
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,540
something's wrong

913
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,940
either the either I can't trust the

914
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,280
quantum Channel

915
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,619
uh or I've I've remembered my my

916
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,859
preparation conditions incorrectly

917
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:52,740
so I'm using one memory to check the

918
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,780
accuracy of the other

919
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,820
and this Pro

920
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,920
of using something about the environment

921
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,500
some channel in the environment to check

922
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,820
memory

923
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,300
is absolutely ubiquitous and

924
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,480
uh we as it all the time so for example

925
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,820
look around your room

926
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,240
and your room hopefully looks more or

927
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,040
less the same now than it did at the

928
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,920
start of this session

929
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,119
and that's very reassuring you know it

930
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,280
it reassures you that something's not

931
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,980
happening in the environment that's

932
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,700
um

933
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,220
dangerous and disturbing

934
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,060
and if you couldn't do that if if your

935
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,480
environment was constantly changing

936
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,060
and there is no familiarity about the

937
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,800
environment you wouldn't be able to

938
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,200
check your memory uh you wouldn't be

939
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,420
able to check your sanity

940
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,780
so even though we don't think about

941
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,780
our local environments as effectively an

942
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,000
error correcting code that's exactly how

943
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,520
we use it we use stigmergic memory or

944
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,700
memory out there in the environment as a

945
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,099
way of checking our own memories and

946
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,720
assuring that our memory is okay

947
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,660
so uh I talked a little bit about

948
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,560
Quantum security uh here's how Quantum

949
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,660
security system works again it's a lock

950
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,980
protocol

951
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,520
uh we have some classical signals that

952
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,660
can be thought of as a code or a key

953
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,160
or a one-time pad for example

954
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,300
that encodes a way of doing experiments

955
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,240
and once that's been exchanged assuming

956
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,300
it's secure then we can use the CL the

957
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,220
quantum channel to communicate

958
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,420
information

959
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,060
and the classical channel has told us

960
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,000
what we have to do with that Quantum

961
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,920
Channel we have to make certain kinds of

962
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,000
measurements

963
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,480
at say particular clock times as

964
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,200
measured and we'll get information

965
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,339
sent from

966
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,320
from the past

967
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,960
from the sender

968
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,180
and

969
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,160
the classical Channel protects the

970
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,400
quantum channel from adversarial agents

971
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,460
because anything that an adversarial

972
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,640
agent does to the quantum Channel if if

973
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,220
some agent tries to eavesdrop for

974
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,079
example on the quantum Channel

975
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,480
they'll disrupt the quantum Channel

976
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,960
and the results of our measurement uh

977
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,280
will not be

978
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,380
what's expected given the protocol that

979
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,599
we run that we have run

980
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,760
so

981
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,060
Quantum communication is secured by the

982
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,280
fact that interfering with some

983
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,619
entangled State actually destroys the

984
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:51,839
state so it's detectable

985
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,960
we can always know if someone is trying

986
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,180
to disrupt our Communications which

987
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,280
isn't true if we just have two classical

988
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,599
channels

989
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:03,119
Charlie can always intercept a message

990
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,520
and then recreate it and that's not

991
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,800
possible with a Quantum Channel

992
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,520
so let's refold this diagram

993
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,020
uh so that we've taken the external time

994
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,079
back out of it

995
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:24,780
and we have this picture where the two

996
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,119
components of Alice are just interacting

997
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,280
via their shared boundary with their

998
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,380
environment Bob

999
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,900
and now we can see that the source of

1000
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,660
redundancy is not time it's the boundary

1001
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,078
itself

1002
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,079
just sharing the boundary

1003
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,180
allows uh Alice's components A1 and A2

1004
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:51,319
to put copies of the same information

1005
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:55,619
on different places on the boundary

1006
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:58,380
so the boundary now becomes a resource

1007
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,440
for redundant storage of information

1008
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,319
so Alice wanted Alice 2 can use

1009
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,040
different parts of the boundary

1010
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,720
uh

1011
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,540
to check what other parts of the

1012
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,119
boundary say to check the information

1013
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,400
that's encoded on other parts of the

1014
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,660
boundary

1015
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,660
so they can define an error correcting

1016
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:25,560
code on the boundary itself using this

1017
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,400
lock protocol

1018
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:30,780
so

1019
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,880
I just want to leave you with this idea

1020
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,400
that

1021
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,440
using classical and quantum

1022
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,960
channels together

1023
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,660
allows us to Define

1024
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,660
error correcting codes on boundaries

1025
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,000
that we share

1026
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,480
as separate agents

1027
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,099
and

1028
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,119
um

1029
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,359
leave you to think about

1030
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:03,660
what shared measurements what shared

1031
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,700
Quantum reference frames

1032
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,819
let us as agents

1033
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:12,500
see the same things

1034
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:15,960
and this is what we'll talk about

1035
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,380
next time in September

1036
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,900
we'll talk specifically about how space

1037
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,280
provides us with an error correcting

1038
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,660
code

1039
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:32,940
and try to understand why space is

1040
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,280
treated as emergent

1041
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,740
from something else basically from

1042
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,359
communication

1043
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,480
in in most of quantum gravity

1044
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,660
so thank you very much uh I encourage

1045
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,300
you to use the interactive QA and to

1046
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,460
attend the discussion sessions

1047
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,579
and we'll see you in September thank you

1048
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,060
awesome

1049
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,560
Chris

1050
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,140
thank you for the lecture

1051
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,960
um Andrew do you have any

1052
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,780
remarks or questions

1053
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,140
no not right now thank you

1054
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,540
I'll just ask a few quick questions and

1055
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,520
if anyone has one quickly in the live

1056
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,099
chat so you mentioned the tick of the

1057
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:23,880
clock and in active inference we often

1058
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,640
hold up side by side both the discrete

1059
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,740
time models and the continuous time

1060
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,560
models so do clocks have to tick

1061
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,380
discreetly or how do we think about

1062
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,119
continuous time modeling

1063
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:41,339
uh in this in this Quantum setting they

1064
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:44,460
do have to take discreetly because one

1065
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,900
has to be able to distinguish uh Alice's

1066
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,240
preparation of the qubits on her

1067
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,200
boundary from Bob's measurements of the

1068
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,540
qubits on the boundary

1069
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,660
and uh

1070
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,020
this process can be extremely fast with

1071
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,700
respect to any kind of sense of

1072
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,819
macroscopic time

1073
00:47:07,819 --> 00:47:10,200
oh you know your your eyes are

1074
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,960
responding to photons in

1075
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,500
um

1076
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,460
I think it's hundreds of femtoseconds

1077
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,319
so the the discrete transitions that are

1078
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,660
effectively time measurements

1079
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,400
for you

1080
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,040
are at that very fast molecular time

1081
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,760
scale much much faster than our typical

1082
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,339
clocks

1083
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:38,280
now when we when we try to do very fast

1084
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,040
timing we're constructing a faster clock

1085
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,280
than that but it's a clock that we can

1086
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,540
only observe indirectly

1087
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,880
awesome okay now this one maybe connects

1088
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,780
a little bit to application but with all

1089
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,660
the developments happening in theory

1090
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,819
some of which you're reviewing here and

1091
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:04,920
also in practice with Quantum

1092
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,300
computation

1093
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,160
and then keeping in mind this

1094
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,579
distinction sorry I've lost you

1095
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:14,119
back

1096
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:20,460
I've Lost You Daniel okay we'll wait

1097
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,599
till you're back

1098
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,359
I can see that no okay okay yeah all

1099
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,680
right just repeat all right motion

1100
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,819
please

1101
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:29,099
um yeah so so given these

1102
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:31,500
um rapid and ongoing developments in

1103
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,780
theory and practice related to Quantum

1104
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,520
information science and and Quantum

1105
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,260
information security

1106
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,520
how are people using this distinction of

1107
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,400
the classical stigmergic memory

1108
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,880
and then the quantum cognitive process

1109
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,140
to anticipate

1110
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,839
how to develop information systems that

1111
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:58,819
are reliable going forward

1112
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,079
um

1113
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,020
I don't I don't know of any

1114
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,500
instances in which of thinking about

1115
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,200
Quantum cognition has entered directly

1116
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,859
into any design of communication

1117
00:49:12,859 --> 00:49:15,839
communication systems oh

1118
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,200
the ability of humans to interact with

1119
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,560
these systems is just assumed

1120
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,400
so it's just assumed that the user can

1121
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,720
interact with say a computer interface

1122
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,300
which is the sort of interface that will

1123
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,760
be provided or is provided to any

1124
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,579
quantum computer so if you think about a

1125
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:39,960
quantum computer

1126
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,359
a practical quantum computer

1127
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,300
it has Classical interfaces front and

1128
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,680
back

1129
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,020
so in

1130
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,599
thinking about interacting with the

1131
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,000
computer I'm giving it some classical

1132
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,460
problem statement for example

1133
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,579
and asking for some classical answer and

1134
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,780
what it's going to give me is a

1135
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,520
probability distribution of classical

1136
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,040
answers

1137
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,240
but I can

1138
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,280
by running the calculation many times

1139
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,260
make that probability distribution

1140
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,099
fairly tight

1141
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,400
so so yeah I don't know if anyone

1142
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,180
talking about Quantum bcis at this point

1143
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,599
it'd be an interesting question

1144
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:26,760
um and

1145
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,200
was it always understood these sorts of

1146
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,140
blind spots and axioms associated with

1147
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,180
classical

1148
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,520
communication was it was it developed as

1149
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,980
kind of like a proposal or like a

1150
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,579
special case and and uh you know

1151
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:47,579
more unpacking was left for later or are

1152
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,380
these blind spots things that were now

1153
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,720
coming into awareness of given what

1154
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,980
we're learning in the quantum

1155
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,880
information Sciences

1156
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,020
I think we're learning how serious they

1157
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:58,980
are

1158
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,859
uh but they were certainly recognized

1159
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:05,400
even by Bohr in his 1928 paper

1160
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,500
and

1161
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,260
um that's a very good paper too it's

1162
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,720
it's called Uh the present state of

1163
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,160
quantum theory or something like that

1164
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,200
and it's in nature

1165
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,300
uh and it's available on the web

1166
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,099
somewhere

1167
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:22,980
uh I I have a copy of it

1168
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,880
uh but it was written uh in a sense it's

1169
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,520
Bohr's summary of the 1927 solve a

1170
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,380
conference which was the conference at

1171
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,460
which

1172
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,380
um everyone doing quantum theory at that

1173
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,220
time

1174
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,839
got together to talk about their results

1175
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:43,800
and in it uh Bohr essentially presents

1176
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,200
what came to be the Copenhagen

1177
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,240
interpretation

1178
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,880
which I

1179
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,240
think is

1180
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,680
probably unfairly called an

1181
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,619
interpretation it's sort of the

1182
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:01,680
the Copenhagen pragmatic stance toward

1183
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,859
quantum theory

1184
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:08,339
and essentially what Bohr says

1185
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:14,280
is uh that if we're going to do science

1186
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,440
we have to assume that people can talk

1187
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,540
to each other

1188
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,020
and if we're going to do science we have

1189
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,359
to assume that there are instruments

1190
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:26,940
that we can manipulate

1191
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,819
and have reasonable confidence that we

1192
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:32,579
know what manipulation we've done so if

1193
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:36,000
if I turn a knob from one to two

1194
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,220
I have to be reasonably confident that

1195
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,500
I'm making a particular change that I

1196
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,599
can understand

1197
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:46,200
and we have to uh have reasonable

1198
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,200
confidence that different Laboratories

1199
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,380
can replicate the same experiment

1200
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,240
and if we think about any of those

1201
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,640
assumptions in purely Quantum theoretic

1202
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,720
terms

1203
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,980
then

1204
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,220
all sorts of questions are raised right

1205
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,800
every Quantum system is unique we have

1206
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,079
the no cloning theorem so every

1207
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:09,660
scientific instrument is unique

1208
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,319
so there's no such thing as as exactly

1209
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:15,960
replicating an experiment right that's

1210
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,200
that's a coarse grained description of

1211
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,180
what I've done with a completely unique

1212
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,920
Quantum system

1213
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,920
and my brain of course is unique

1214
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,740
uh and yours is too and everyone else's

1215
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,940
is

1216
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,140
so talking about a sharing a language

1217
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,240
is essentially a coarse grained

1218
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,859
assumption

1219
00:53:37,859 --> 00:53:41,339
and what the Copenhagen stance is all

1220
00:53:41,339 --> 00:53:43,980
about is coarse graining yielding

1221
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,740
effective classicality or what that

1222
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:50,099
really means is coarse graining yielding

1223
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:53,160
a description that we can use in in our

1224
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,859
in the language that we understand

1225
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:59,760
so these are very very old issues

1226
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,980
that have been recognized for a long

1227
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,119
time

1228
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,940
but I think in part because of the

1229
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,880
disaster of shut up and calculate

1230
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,160
uh they haven't really been talked about

1231
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,940
in the classroom

1232
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,280
awesome I'll just read short questions

1233
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,980
from the chat we can just uh we can pass

1234
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,960
them to the discussion section but but

1235
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,880
there's a lot of great diverse questions

1236
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,119
so Alexi wrote I think I've Lost You

1237
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,440
Again

1238
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,559
the Revenge of Zoom well

1239
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,540
we looked at the chart earlier where

1240
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,119
like Bob was talking to Alice

1241
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:38,280
the unidirectional communication okay

1242
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,079
good

1243
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,839
yeah okay okay okay the unidirectional

1244
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:46,260
the third party is recording it I'm sure

1245
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,260
um Alexi wrote uh regarding the

1246
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,839
environment for uh being used for error

1247
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,099
correction

1248
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:55,740
a symptom of derealization in Psychology

1249
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,800
psychological trauma breakdown we don't

1250
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,900
recognize the environment around us and

1251
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,319
it's scary

1252
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,220
makes sense makes sense all right from

1253
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,119
Bala nice presentation I heard Chris say

1254
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,000
entangled states are locc for a specific

1255
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,160
reference frame is this entanglement

1256
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,040
unitary or is it related to the numbers

1257
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,420
of degrees of freedom

1258
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:27,059
um

1259
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:30,599
I I think the the quick answer would be

1260
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,280
both

1261
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,339
uh if you have a complex system with

1262
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:37,500
many degrees of freedom some can be

1263
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,099
entangled While others aren't

1264
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:44,400
uh it depends on what parts of the state

1265
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,040
are separable

1266
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,440
so again entanglement is just a

1267
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,700
statement about uh

1268
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,500
components components of a joint state

1269
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,119
that factor or don't

1270
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,859
so you can have a joint state that looks

1271
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,660
that looks separable along some

1272
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,720
Dimensions but does

1273
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,520
know the dimensions

1274
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,040
another big complication here is that

1275
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,040
whether a state looks entangled depends

1276
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,200
on the reference frames that you use to

1277
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,799
measure it with

1278
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:22,260
and if you if you pick entangled

1279
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,900
reference frames then what we ordinarily

1280
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,359
think of as separable as entangled

1281
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,220
States become separable

1282
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,020
so you can move entanglement around

1283
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,380
awesome okay from Roland Rodriguez

1284
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,020
is the discrete temporality only within

1285
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,000
the context of a given holographic

1286
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,700
screen interface with time being

1287
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,040
bracketed otherwise Beyond interface

1288
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,339
systems is continuity or discretion kept

1289
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:53,000
agnostic

1290
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,839
oh

1291
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:57,960
I think if I understand the question

1292
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,280
correctly it's yes uh if I don't draw

1293
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,280
any boundaries I just have the joint

1294
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,660
state

1295
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,079
then the evolution is unitary

1296
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,880
and uh in a sense time plays no role

1297
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,579
and if if unitary

1298
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:21,359
evolution is perfectly time symmetric so

1299
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:25,520
time actually drops out altogether

1300
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,780
awesome so talk about time we have to

1301
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,339
draw boundaries

1302
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:33,599
awesome time must have a stop Huxley and

1303
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,780
I'll ask one last question from the

1304
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,880
appropriately monitored question

1305
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,440
quanderer

1306
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,680
all communication is abductive is a

1307
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,599
sentiment that I've been using to

1308
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,400
develop some arguments does that scan

1309
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,319
for you

1310
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:51,420
how do we connect what we're discussing

1311
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:55,940
here with Quantum to abductive logic

1312
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:57,260
um

1313
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:00,839
yeah I I

1314
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:03,480
I could go along with that I'd want a

1315
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,780
lot more detail uh

1316
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,440
all communication is is essentially

1317
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,920
analogical I I would agree with that yes

1318
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,339
enter

1319
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:20,880
yes thank you um uh so going back to the

1320
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,300
picture where the scattering picture

1321
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,220
um so we have so far everything is is

1322
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:29,040
topological and

1323
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,200
um we certainly induces you know

1324
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,400
breaking the boundary in different

1325
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,920
sectors I suppose it induces a topology

1326
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,099
on the boundary now I had a couple

1327
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,440
questions as for the geometry and this

1328
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,540
might be getting ahead

1329
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,380
um

1330
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,260
is it is it an emerging property of

1331
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,180
those channels between different uh

1332
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,640
boundary sectors and if if that's the

1333
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,200
case then what what does it mean to have

1334
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,578
a qrf for space

1335
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,059
um yeah this is this is this is really

1336
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:04,140
the topic for September but uh you you

1337
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,780
do raise you do point out the fact that

1338
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,160
it's something of a chicken and egg

1339
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,339
situation uh

1340
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:12,299
uh the way

1341
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:15,420
I think of it is I suppose to choose the

1342
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,500
chicken side

1343
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:21,420
and think about uh what kind of

1344
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,040
reference frame

1345
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,280
does the agent have to implement

1346
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,020
to

1347
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:31,760
to see space on their boundary

1348
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,440
and the the reason I think about it that

1349
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,260
way is that's a question I want to be

1350
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,660
able to ask about biological systems and

1351
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,119
and this actually gets into

1352
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:43,619
probably what won't be talked about

1353
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:45,240
until October

1354
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,520
but uh

1355
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,180
I I want to be able to ask

1356
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,200
um

1357
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,900
essentially a phylogenetic question

1358
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,680
of what sorts of organisms where and the

1359
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,200
lineage from Luca

1360
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,059
do uh we find systems that are able to

1361
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:07,920
assign spatial coordinates to their

1362
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,960
boundaries and what coordinates come

1363
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,920
first and I I suspect that that

1364
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,900
uh

1365
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:19,260
sort of discrete location names with no

1366
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,980
metric come first

1367
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:25,160
that A system can talk about for example

1368
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,079
uh this part of their membrane versus

1369
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:30,180
that part of their membrane

1370
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,640
without even having any ability to say

1371
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,720
how far apart they are and the that some

1372
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,000
sort of metric representation of this

1373
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,200
angular space comes later

1374
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,799
and that a radial space comes even later

1375
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,140
than that but that's that's at this

1376
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,059
point speculation but I think these are

1377
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:54,180
questions that we can end up asking uh

1378
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,819
given the right kind of formalism

1379
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,680
and the right understanding of what it

1380
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,619
means to to to be able to make a spatial

1381
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:03,359
measurement

1382
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,579
so the conjecture is that uh the metric

1383
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,040
would emerge from a discrete Network

1384
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,440
metric of counting ticks sort of thing

1385
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,900
yeah yeah I think that's I think that's

1386
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,240
correct and

1387
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,160
uh that the sort of the sort of

1388
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,440
symmetries of space that we see

1389
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,720
are very much tied up with object

1390
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,900
identity so if we think about

1391
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:27,000
um you know something like rotational

1392
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,160
symmetry let's see uh

1393
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,879
I should stop screen sharing

1394
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,220
so you know I've got this object right

1395
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,299
and

1396
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:45,000
and I can do this and I say oh you know

1397
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,900
space has this rotational symmetry

1398
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,220
but for me to say that I have to

1399
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,960
recognize that this is the same object

1400
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,720
right I I have to implement

1401
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,780
object persistence which we all learn to

1402
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,460
do when we're nine months old or

1403
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:00,780
something

1404
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,260
but uh we tend to regard those as

1405
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:08,520
separate things as you know we we learn

1406
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,859
object persistence because space is

1407
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:12,839
rotationally symmetric

1408
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:14,339
but we can view it the other way around

1409
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:17,220
that space is rotationally symmetric for

1410
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,540
me

1411
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,640
because I Implement these constraints

1412
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,780
that are called object persistence okay

1413
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,839
do you think we can understand

1414
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:30,420
phylogenetics as a whole as a kind of

1415
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,940
scattering experiment like the high

1416
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:36,780
energy leuka event and then dissipating

1417
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:42,780
and propagating in a very Tangled Bank

1418
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,240
well I I I do want to be able to

1419
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,700
understand phylogeny in exactly the same

1420
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,480
terms as as embryology

1421
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,920
Mike Levin and I have published papers

1422
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,359
about that that we should be able to

1423
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:57,180
view the lineage of Luca in exactly the

1424
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,819
same way that you know we we view the

1425
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:03,299
lineage of the zygote that produced us

1426
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:04,980
so that's why it's it's no coincidence

1427
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,000
that

1428
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,740
um

1429
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,200
during pregnancy uh the the development

1430
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,900
of the embryo merus evolution

1431
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,940
in terms of the parts that are developed

1432
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,559
first

1433
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,200
yeah this is the old idea that that

1434
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,900
phylogen and you're not an endogeny are

1435
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,260
are related in some way which from an

1436
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,900
embryonic development point of view

1437
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,599
um they're certainly analogous in ways

1438
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,799
and uh sorry if I may ask one last

1439
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,359
question that I think should be very

1440
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:39,240
quick uh regarding that the weak

1441
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,160
rotation I'm still a bit unsure of how

1442
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,520
it ties to to this uh diagrammatic

1443
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,859
notation that we had uh with Quantum

1444
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:49,020
channels I'm sure so on

1445
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:51,140
um

1446
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,760
in the second session we briefly talked

1447
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,099
about the weak rotation

1448
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:59,579
um you know being a a reversal in the

1449
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:01,740
direction of time is there any relation

1450
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,520
to today's session

1451
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:08,660
yeah I

1452
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,520
whenever we think about

1453
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:17,220
uh the flow of time as driven by the

1454
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,280
input output cycle

1455
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:24,180
the the input output cycle for agents

1456
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,940
separated by a boundary is is always

1457
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:30,059
there's always a sign change right my

1458
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:32,839
input is your output and vice versa

1459
01:04:32,839 --> 01:04:35,520
so uh

1460
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,380
when we think about the

1461
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:42,720
Bob's clock ticking when Alice does

1462
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,280
something

1463
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,140
oh

1464
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:47,700
his

1465
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,339
direction of direction of time in a

1466
01:04:50,339 --> 01:04:52,440
sense points with respect to the

1467
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:56,180
boundary opposite to hers

1468
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,859
but that's only with respect to the

1469
01:04:58,859 --> 01:05:01,619
boundary he sees he sees information

1470
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:03,900
flowing in and she sees information

1471
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,140
flowing in that's

1472
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,359
that's the only point being made here

1473
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:12,780
about the wick rotation as an operation

1474
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,640
right

1475
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,619
thank you

1476
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:18,480
thank you Chris

1477
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,900
very well appreciated by the viewers and

1478
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:25,140
by us so we'll certainly look forward to

1479
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:28,859
reviewing the Q a and everybody is

1480
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:31,799
welcome and encouraged to join for the

1481
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:34,020
participatory discussion in about two

1482
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,660
weeks on Saturday so

1483
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,880
till next time

1484
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,980
all right thank you cheers
