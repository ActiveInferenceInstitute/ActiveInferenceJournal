4230	4780	A	0.546256959438324	You.
7390	9306	B	0.9103710651397705	Hello and welcome, everyone.
9488	10422	B	0.6908595561981201	This is physics.
10486	14806	B	0.9070470929145813	As information processing session four on communicating observers.
14918	17740	B	0.9103759527206421	It's the 10 August 2023.
18110	20390	B	0.9804589748382568	Chris looking forward to this lecture.
20470	21580	B	0.6221094727516174	Off to you.
23470	26810	A	0.9839782118797302	Thank you, Daniel, and welcome to this session.
27310	30734	A	0.8510136008262634	As Daniel said, this is about out communicating observers.
30862	35540	A	0.646869421005249	And fasten your seatbelts because we have a lot to cover in the next hour.
36870	39170	A	0.7705681920051575	So just to do a quick review.
39320	55850	A	0.547546923160553	We've been talking about quantum information theory and we've been talking about it in the simplest possible setting of two systems, Alice and Bob, that exchange information through their mutual boundary.
56350	60118	A	0.48419317603111267	And we've assumed that everything is finite dimensional.
60214	65130	A	0.6835876107215881	So we don't need to worry about infinite energy transfer across this boundary.
65790	72682	A	0.6975330710411072	And of course, we assume conservation of energy so there are no sources or sinks in either of the systems.
72746	87250	A	0.557095468044281	Alice and Bob and we emphasize that this way of depicting things as topological we're not assuming any background geometry, no sort of spatial embedding which is going to become very important in this session.
89750	102706	A	0.896389365196228	In the last session, we talked about how the boundary, which I'll always call B can be thought of as a channel that comprises N qubits that are independent.
102818	113450	A	0.8328235149383545	And Alice and Bob each can prepare and measure those qubits and they can always choose independently their reference frames for doing so.
113520	121070	A	0.8975935578346252	So how they define up and down when they're measuring a spin with effectively a Zspin operator.
121810	124430	A	0.800940752029419	To interact with these qubits.
125810	130690	A	0.763380765914917	We talked a little bit about the free energy principle and its quantum formulation.
131510	143250	A	0.8603523373603821	And the principle basically says that interacting systems will behave in a way that aligns their reference frames and that they therefore asymptotically approach entanglement.
143410	147906	A	0.7720116376876831	So the FEP is a classical limit of the principle of unitarity.
148098	161100	A	0.771543562412262	And that's one reason for studying quantum information to learn more about the FEP and so to learn more about active inference and what the theory of active inference says about agents.
162990	172880	A	0.7855613231658936	And last time, we talked a lot about the constraints that are imposed by a limited free energy supply on any agent.
174050	191626	A	0.7784228324890137	Recall that we talked about the fact that in the absence of sources of free energy within an agent so as long as you conserve energy globally that the free energy that each agent uses has to come from its environment.
191758	193590	A	0.5361505150794983	That's clearly true for us.
193660	199510	A	0.5745742917060852	We have to consume oxygen and eat food and things like that to keep running as systems.
200490	216970	A	0.8230596780776978	And we discussed a little bit this theorem that if two reference frames or quantum processes, q One and Q Two don't commute, they have to be implemented by compartments that communicate classically.
217050	219520	A	0.794983983039856	And we'll use this extensively today.
220450	233970	A	0.5996391177177429	But the bottom line last time was that physics alone gives us compartmentalization in systems whenever the systems are complex enough to have multiple kinds of measurements that they can't deploy simultaneously.
236390	254470	A	0.863504946231842	So where we're going today, we're going to start from this place we left off last time of the possibility of agents that are compartmentalized and into compartments that have to communicate classically.
255070	270830	A	0.883574903011322	So we're going to talk about agents that can be compartmentalized into multiple subagents that share an environment, the environment consisting of Bob and how those agents talk about that shared environment.
271490	274000	A	0.779160737991333	So the motivation for this is simple.
274450	278250	A	0.8488115668296814	It's that what we do all the time is a group activity.
278330	283470	A	0.7161955237388611	And what we're doing right now is a group activity that involves sharing an environment.
283550	287060	A	0.8587610125541687	What's shown on this screen and talking about it.
287430	296886	A	0.591469943523407	And the whole post session discussion process will be another example of just that sort of thing.
297068	313130	A	0.8714381456375122	So to talk about science at all or to talk about any kind of social relations or to talk about anything other than solipsism, we have to be able to talk about how multiple agents communicate about some shared environment.
313630	318000	A	0.8495382070541382	And so that's what we're going to develop a formal way of talking about.
318690	323920	A	0.6814591884613037	And there are two things to notice right off the top about this.
324610	331310	A	0.7141811847686768	One is that the way we've defined interactions at boundaries, they're effectively instantaneous.
331470	337758	A	0.8572041392326355	So each agent, remember, interacts with its boundary with some set of operators.
337854	345326	A	0.8952690362930298	And what those operators do is effectively measure each operator effectively measures the spin of a qubit.
345518	347940	A	0.5663690567016602	So this is a very fast process.
350390	370762	A	0.823623538017273	The other thing that we then need to notice is that if we have two agents and they're communicating with each other classically, then they're going to be using degrees of freedom of their shared environment in order to communicate.
370906	373278	A	0.7637377977371216	And that's exactly what we're doing right now.
373364	379718	A	0.8301243782043457	For example, we're using degrees of freedom of the Internet to communicate.
379914	391140	A	0.8428945541381836	I'm using degrees of freedom of the local atmosphere to talk to my microphone and I'm using degrees of freedom of the local photon field to see my screen.
392090	403122	A	0.8586698770523071	So all communication between agents and certainly all classical communication between agents uses degrees of freedom of the environment.
403186	410090	A	0.7872318029403687	And the environment, remember, is the other system, Bob, that's on the other side of that shared boundary.
410750	420698	A	0.8197755813598633	So we're going to be interested in how components of Alice use Bob as a communication channel and in fact, as multiple communication channels.
420874	429558	A	0.5403546094894409	And I just wanted to quote my colleague and friend Mike Levin in his statement that all intelligence is composite.
429754	449270	A	0.7944601774215698	All of us, all organisms, even single cells, are composite systems that comprise many different agents that are able to make different kinds of measurements and execute different kinds of actions and so have to communicate classically.
450010	458780	A	0.8647817969322205	So we're talking about all of life here as well as all of social systems and ecosystems and such things as that.
460270	470490	A	0.6361501812934875	So the first thing I want to do today is simplify the notation so that we don't have to draw quite such complicated diagrams.
470650	474618	A	0.9354766607284546	So the picture on the left here is a picture from the last session.
474794	490900	A	0.8836859464645386	It shows the structure of a very simple agent that makes some measurements using a reference frame called e and then writes some results of those measurements to memory using a reference frame called y.
491450	500662	A	0.883620023727417	And those two processes are connected by an internal clock that ticks between the input process and the output process.
500796	508490	A	0.8447506427764893	And the clock tick corresponds to the expenditure of free energy to write information irreversibly on the boundary.
508830	515478	A	0.8656747937202454	So the memories are actually written on the boundary because that's where classical information lives in this theory.
515654	530930	A	0.900600016117096	So you can think of this whole process from e through the clock and back to y as a single quantum process or as a quantum computation that maps some sector e of the boundary to some sector Y of the boundary.
531590	544150	A	0.6150044202804565	And so we can represent it in this much simpler way that's over on the right side as some process Q that maps some sector on the boundary to some other sector on the boundary.
544650	551030	A	0.8691396117210388	And formally, that process can be thought of as a topological quantum field theory.
551530	553446	A	0.682327151298523	Topological here is important.
553548	561660	A	0.5934718251228333	It's not geometric, it doesn't assume an embedding in space and this will become critically important later on.
562030	573790	A	0.8920221328735352	And the operation of that tqft requires a clock tick or it incorporates a tick of this internal clock.
574370	592530	A	0.8390296697616577	And we can do this because we were able to prove jim Glazeburg and Tanino Marciano and I were able to prove last year that we can always represent a quantum reference frame as a topological quantum field theory.
592690	599526	A	0.6171590685844421	And this just illustrates the two kinds of transformations between quantum reference frames that are important.
599628	622730	A	0.8989793062210083	We can take one and divide it into two pieces that commute or we can take a two part reference frame and we can swap in another part that doesn't commute with the part that we've swapped it in for but that does commute with the remainder of the reference frame.
622810	637394	A	0.9010319113731384	So here R is the reference component of some object identification system and we can swap in some different way of looking at the object once we've identified it.
637432	661690	A	0.9123117327690125	So, for example, if the object that we're identifying is a box that can measure both Z spin and X spin, then P and Q can be the z spin and x spin settings on that box that allow us to effectively rotate the filter from this way to that way so that we measure vertical spin versus horizontal spin.
662110	663562	A	0.5805956125259399	And that's really it.
663616	669194	A	0.7392044067382812	I mean, those are the ways that one can transform quantum reference frames.
669322	687810	A	0.630889356136322	Of course, we could do arbitrarily many compositions of this kind of transformation to do something very complicated, but they map very simply to tqfts with the structure and you can construct categories out of this and find a function that's well defined that maps one category to another.
687880	698390	A	0.9141624569892883	So it's an example of a nice use of categorical techniques for solving a problem that looks difficult but in fact it's very straightforward.
699370	728350	A	0.5581017732620239	So using this simplified notation, it becomes very easy to see that if we have two systems, alice and Bob on opposite sides of this boundary and we perfectly align their quantum reference frames, which is what the FEP says they will tend to do, then they become entangled.
728790	739940	A	0.6203517913818359	And you can see that they're entangled by seeing that once the reference frames are perfectly aligned, they jointly implement one quantum process.
741610	746630	A	0.6899134516716003	And jointly implementing one quantum process just means you're entangled.
747290	753640	A	0.5544305443763733	The two sides no longer have conditionally independent states.
754190	763930	A	0.777442216873169	If one quantum process, which is time reversible, information preserving, is implemented jointly by the two systems.
764510	786158	A	0.7388172745704651	So a lot of things like this become very simple when we think of these processes as just quantum computations going on inside some system implemented by some system and how those processes relate across some boundary.
786334	792680	A	0.7298520803451538	So that's what we're going to do for studying communication today.
794410	812454	A	0.6988896131515503	Another thing to recall from a couple of sessions ago, our last session, is that if two reference frames, q one and Q Two commute, we can always join them together to form a single reference frame.
812502	818560	A	0.7430176138877869	And this is just a graphical depiction in this simpler language of how that works.
819250	826862	A	0.6029338836669922	And topologically, there's no distinction between the left side and the right side.
826916	834210	A	0.8750210404396057	What I've done is just squeeze the top two green circles together and the bottom two green circles together into one circle.
834790	840594	A	0.7304474711418152	And that just makes a simple process connecting the top one to the bottom one.
840792	856170	A	0.7545760273933411	So what we're going to be interested in is situations where this doesn't happen, where Alice consists of two components that execute reference frames that don't commute.
856750	862822	A	0.7977672219276428	And so the two components are conditionally independent.
862886	866410	A	0.8087146878242493	They do each have free choice of reference frame.
867090	870074	A	0.6837277412414551	And so they have to communicate classically.
870202	877070	A	0.662594735622406	They don't share a single quantum process, so they're not entangled.
878130	908006	A	0.8571404218673706	And before we go ahead to do that, I just wanted to remind you of some of the no go theorems that follow from this situation depicted on the right, where we have a single agent executing a single reference frame, a single process, a single kind of measurement, any set of commuting measurements that can be combined into one measurement.
908198	910666	A	0.655865490436554	And here are some things Alice can't do.
910768	913450	A	0.859384298324585	And we've talked about some of these previously.
913870	916490	A	0.7774547934532166	So this is basically a reminder.
917090	927626	A	0.6160314083099365	But Alice can't, using just one measurement, measure the entanglement entropy across her own boundary.
927818	931442	A	0.667945146560669	So Alice can't know that she has an independent state.
931576	935598	A	0.6024813652038574	She can't know that she's not entangled with Bob.
935774	942360	A	0.7430081367492676	And that's a useful thing to think about philosophically as it applies to you and me.
942810	946360	A	0.5811247825622559	We can't actually know that we have independent states.
947690	957530	A	0.5331539511680603	Alice can't measure her own entanglement entropy, so she can't know whether she has components that have to communicate classically.
959630	968430	A	0.5663838982582092	She can't measure Bob's entanglement entropy, so she can't know whether Bob has compartments that have to communicate classically.
968850	978670	A	0.650825560092926	And if you think in terms of perception theory, this says Alice can't know whether Bob consists of separate objects that behave classically.
981190	993190	A	0.5661656260490417	Their behavior can look classical to her, but she's not able to determine that their behavior is classical because she can't measure Bob's entanglement entropy.
994410	1014540	A	0.6481224894523621	She can't measure the dimension of her own boundary and recall from a couple of times ago that the boundary includes some sector that supplies free energy that Alice can't extract information from for further processing, she can only extract free energy from.
1014990	1023360	A	0.4957430064678192	So she can't measure the dimension of that sector, and so she can't measure the dimension of the whole boundary itself.
1023970	1027646	A	0.6096301674842834	And this, of course, means that she can't measure her own dimension either.
1027748	1036382	A	0.6274224519729614	And of course, she can't measure Bob's dimension, because the only information she can get about Bob is the classical information that's encoded on this boundary.
1036446	1041220	A	0.5771443843841553	She can't reach past the boundary to see how large a system Bob is.
1041850	1057350	A	0.5817045569419861	And that's clearly connected to this first point, that she can't measure the entanglement entropy across Bob, because the entanglement entropy can only be small if her dimension and Bob's dimension are both much larger than the dimension of the boundary.
1057430	1059740	A	0.510801374912262	So that's a condition she can't check.
1061310	1066330	A	0.7025459408760071	So all of these kind of no go theorems lead off in interesting directions.
1066690	1088610	A	0.7169008255004883	And the only one that we're really going to be interested in here is the third one, the one about measuring Bob's entanglement entropy, because we want to talk specifically about how multiple agents, so multiple components of Alice can access information about Bob's entanglement entropy.
1093050	1101290	A	0.9059275984764099	Okay, so recall from the end of the last session that the last thing we talked about was classical communication.
1101950	1111920	A	0.6098455786705017	And we talked about the fact that classical communication involves assumptions and pitfalls and that we have to be very careful whenever we talk about it.
1112450	1117178	A	0.8857801556587219	And what we're going to do today is standard practice in physics.
1117274	1127390	A	0.8474962711334229	We're simply going to stipulate that these components, a one and a two, the separable components of Alice, communicate classically.
1127470	1129202	A	0.8473203778266907	And so we're going to draw it like this.
1129256	1135330	A	0.9092555642127991	We're going to draw a classical channel between them, and that classical channel passes through Bob.
1135410	1149610	A	0.8761746883392334	It uses degrees of freedom of the ambient photon field or the ambient atmosphere or pieces of paper or email or something like that that's out there in the environment to exchange classical messages.
1150510	1154394	A	0.5409117937088013	And there are a couple of things to note here I haven't even written down here.
1154432	1159322	A	0.8627853393554688	We're assuming that a one and a two share some language for this classical communication.
1159386	1162320	A	0.6118388772010803	That's a big assumption, as we talked about last time.
1163810	1168398	A	0.8237776756286621	But I will note explicitly that classical communication takes time.
1168564	1171554	A	0.7896513938903809	That's what defines classicality here.
1171592	1176180	A	0.6322503685951233	It's causal, so it can't work faster than the speed of light.
1177030	1179150	A	0.7815390229225159	This is a topological theory.
1179230	1181102	A	0.6027715802192688	We don't have any embedding geometry.
1181166	1191240	A	0.5904292464256287	So we can't, at this point, talk about light, which is a relationship between space and time, because we've got time, we've got clocks, but we don't have any space.
1191930	1201900	A	0.8613767623901367	But we can say that whatever passes through this classical channel requires at least one clock tick on Bob's side.
1202590	1206330	A	0.804400622844696	So it's a process that Bob has to execute.
1206930	1210158	A	0.6944092512130737	And executing that process takes time.
1210244	1216318	A	0.6855099201202393	So getting the signal from me to you on the internet takes some time.
1216484	1220340	A	0.8272961974143982	So the environment's clock has to tick during that.
1221110	1241686	A	0.6564652323722839	And all of these assumptions bundled together turn out to be a fairly serious set of assumptions and they involve assumptions about fine tuning, about the universe being just right and they should make us nervous and I just want to leave it at that.
1241868	1247142	A	0.6944335103034973	We always assume with complete a plumb that agents can communicate classically.
1247206	1258442	A	0.4941186010837555	But it's not a straightforward assumption and it's worth any of you are looking at for interesting research projects can look into the nature of classical communication.
1258506	1266846	A	0.7150859832763672	It's full of hidden assumptions and surprises and things that aren't at all straightforward even though they look like they ought to be.
1267028	1268590	A	0.7730294466018677	So there's a challenge.
1269890	1271374	A	0.599416196346283	So why do we assume this?
1271412	1273758	A	0.5862936973571777	Why do we assume classical communication?
1273934	1278930	A	0.8207864165306091	We do it because we have to if we're going to talk about detecting entanglement.
1280070	1287666	A	0.6648178696632385	And most of you probably know the history of the notion of entanglement.
1287778	1296314	A	0.8181873559951782	It was first noticed by Einstein, Podolski and Rosen ever after called EPR in 1935.
1296512	1309390	A	0.7823185920715332	And they wrote a paper which is infamous and called the EPR Paper in which they argued that the phenomenon of entanglement made no sense and couldn't possibly be physical.
1310050	1320100	A	0.5602346062660217	And since quantum theory included this notion of entanglement, it couldn't possibly be a complete theory of what's going on in the world.
1320710	1331570	A	0.8277193903923035	And Schrodinger replied the same year with a very detailed paper where he introduces, among other things, Schrodinger's cat as a paradox.
1332170	1338498	A	0.5648622512817383	And he explains very clearly what entanglement is and why entanglement follows from quantum theory.
1338674	1347322	A	0.49258139729499817	And he uses that discussion to argue that the classical notion of a physical state is not actually applicable to the world as it is.
1347376	1351050	A	0.74472576379776	So he answers the EPR paper very directly.
1352270	1373810	A	0.6126163005828857	And this discussion is currently mostly known as the Bohr Einstein debate because of course Bohr already in 1928 has said had said in print that the classical notion of causality in space and time simply doesn't apply anymore.
1374470	1377646	A	0.5845709443092346	And Einstein objected to that vigorously.
1377838	1385090	A	0.763193666934967	But that was 1935 and it was almost 50 years later that entanglement was first observed in the laboratory.
1385170	1398060	A	0.7359640598297119	Here the 1982 picture is a picture of the interior of Alan Aspet's laboratory when he performed the first entanglement experiment for which he finally won the Nobel Prize last year.
1399790	1409310	A	0.7661747336387634	And these days this kind of experiment is done all over the world and is even done with satellite borne sources.
1412710	1428440	A	0.6566401124000549	Resource is the key to quantum secured communication, as we'll discuss in quantum cryptography and quantum banking and the quantum internet, all this other stuff that you may have heard of.
1429450	1440570	A	0.8320413827896118	So before talking more about these experiments, I just want to provide a definition of entanglement.
1442350	1446278	A	0.5880992412567139	Entangled simply means not separable.
1446374	1447850	A	0.6258833408355713	That's the definition.
1448270	1459220	A	0.7297595739364624	So a state, a joint state AB is entangled if and only if it does not factor into two separable states.
1460310	1461426	A	0.5477846264839172	And that's it.
1461528	1462930	A	0.6258833408355713	That's the definition.
1463830	1484540	A	0.4497430920600891	And the literature, and especially the popular literature, is absolutely rife with hype and various kinds of mischief of entanglement and authors trying to convince you that entanglement is this amazing kind of woo woo thing.
1485310	1500670	A	0.6702480912208557	And whenever you run across that, go back to the definition, entanglement simply means this simple mathematical condition of not separability or a state that isn't factorizable.
1501170	1506346	A	0.5119451880455017	And that means that the state does not display classical conditional independence.
1506538	1509074	A	0.6798199415206909	So classically, that's the way to think about it.
1509112	1511810	A	0.8035194277763367	It's a failure of conditional independence.
1512230	1519650	A	0.5872434377670288	And it's ubiquitous in quantum theory, even though it wasn't actually absurd for almost 50 years after it was predicted.
1521130	1524182	A	0.7547509670257568	So here's what all these experiments look like.
1524236	1535406	A	0.8877763748168945	They're called Bell EPR experiments, after John Bell, who derived the statistical criterion for detecting entanglement and EPR.
1535458	1544330	A	0.649904727935791	Einstein, Podolski and Rosen, who did this as a thought experiment and said, if this occurs in the theory, it can't possibly be real.
1544400	1545900	A	0.7298550605773926	And of course it is real.
1546270	1549390	A	0.7945302724838257	It's now amply demonstrated by experimentation.
1550050	1551022	A	0.7520907521247864	Here's how they work.
1551076	1552190	A	0.7658177018165588	There's a source.
1552930	1557562	A	0.6758341789245605	The source produces a state that is entangled.
1557706	1562050	A	0.6030441522598267	And I've written the typical what's called a Bell state.
1562200	1567906	A	0.8597201108932495	It's up plus or minus down divided by the square root of two just to normalize it.
1568088	1573350	A	0.6069267988204956	But up plus or minus down is clearly not the same as up times down.
1573420	1575720	A	0.6543641686439514	So this is not a separable state.
1576570	1586886	A	0.8662428259849548	And this state propagates outward in space and time to two observers who have independent laboratories, for example, on different continents.
1586998	1602830	A	0.8541945219039917	In that space based experiment that I showed you the picture of from the COVID of Science a few years ago, 2017, I think, the Tulip observers have freedom to choose their own reference frame, their own Z axis for measuring spin.
1603170	1607550	A	0.6813324093818665	They do a spin measurement, and they do this over and over and over again.
1607620	1617598	A	0.8887708783149719	They accumulate statistics and they exchange their results so that they can analyze the joint statistics of their experiment.
1617774	1623938	A	0.896904706954956	And they check to see whether that joint statistics is consistent with classical probability theory.
1624114	1634090	A	0.7512405514717102	And if it isn't to a statistically significant level, then they've been able to detect entanglement.
1634910	1640086	A	0.8524304628372192	Now, notice that this process requires classical communication.
1640278	1653550	A	0.8387659192085266	They have to make their independent measurements in their own laboratories, and then they have to exchange results, or one of them has to send results to the other one, or they both have to send their results to some third party.
1653890	1658962	A	0.8336781859397888	But in all of these cases, they're exchanging some classical data.
1659096	1669730	A	0.8099669814109802	And so we have the assumption that whoever gets that classical data knows the language it was recorded in and so can do a joint analysis.
1670410	1677062	A	0.8647081255912781	So I'll just show you another picture of this experiment that's in a standard space time diagram here.
1677116	1679830	A	0.7651722431182861	Time is vertical, space is horizontal.
1681930	1684970	A	0.8956454396247864	The two observers are labeled Alice and Bob.
1686190	1691622	A	0.9026901125907898	They share a quantum channel that goes from Alice to the source to Bob.
1691686	1693340	A	0.6118338704109192	That's the entangled state.
1694190	1696082	A	0.8228808045387268	They do some processing.
1696246	1701194	A	0.9149487614631653	And then one of them here, Bob, sends the results to Alice.
1701322	1703658	A	0.7952104806900024	And that's a classical communication.
1703754	1707600	A	0.7804638147354126	It takes time, and it traverses space.
1708470	1710910	A	0.8581224679946899	So this step is classical.
1711070	1719250	A	0.8789086937904358	So this is why we have to assume classical communication to talk about detecting or using entanglement.
1720470	1723640	A	0.6776771545410156	So now I want to represent this in a different way.
1725770	1728226	A	0.7498313188552856	Using our little picture earlier.
1728418	1732520	A	0.8921287655830383	We're going to think of Alice, again as two components, a one and a two.
1733070	1736890	A	0.7481412887573242	They're separable, so they have to communicate classically.
1737230	1743866	A	0.8782527446746826	They have a classical channel that goes through Bob, and they also now share some quantum channel.
1743968	1746060	A	0.7581840753555298	They share an entangled state.
1746670	1749642	A	0.626893162727356	And the entangled state, of course, is produced by Bob.
1749706	1752030	A	0.7999127507209778	The source is part of Bob.
1752450	1763060	A	0.8990616202354431	And their detectors, if you want to think about it that way, are located on this boundary B, or their interface with the sources on this boundary B.
1763830	1774760	A	0.8901650905609131	And each of them executes a process that accumulates data from the quantum channel and communicates it to the other observer via the classical channel.
1776010	1779842	A	0.6964144110679626	Now, this picture illustrates what's called a lock protocol.
1779986	1784250	A	0.8169397115707397	Lock means local operations and classical communication.
1784830	1789766	A	0.8899675607681274	So a one and a two are each operating locally on their boundary.
1789878	1800938	A	0.8946861028671265	They're making measurements locally on their boundary, and they're communicating via actions locally on their boundary and observations locally on their boundary.
1801034	1806526	A	0.8554521203041077	So, for example, I'm communicating with my computer here.
1806628	1808958	A	0.8791333436965942	We can consider it my boundary.
1809134	1823094	A	0.8005828261375427	And stuff is happening in the environment that's implemented by the Internet, and you're receiving those communications locally on your boundary, on your laptop or whatever it is you're using.
1823292	1826360	A	0.8404399752616882	So that's what local operations means.
1826890	1831890	A	0.8918712139129639	And these protocols specifically involve classical communication.
1831970	1834774	A	0.8111417293548584	And so they're able to detect entanglement.
1834902	1839370	A	0.538594663143158	And a Bell EPR experiment is just an example of a lock protocol.
1840670	1845974	A	0.9194026589393616	The observers exchange information about how they're going to do their experiments.
1846022	1848202	A	0.8464152812957764	They're both going to measure D spin.
1848346	1855070	A	0.8681149482727051	They're going to use independently chosen reference frames, and they're going to look at the output from some agreed upon source.
1855970	1858480	A	0.7351844310760498	So that's all classically set up.
1858870	1864270	A	0.8802264332771301	Then they actually make their observations, and then they classically communicate their results.
1864350	1877510	A	0.8837041258811951	So classical communication front and back lock protocols are not limited to this sort of Bell EPR sort of setting.
1877930	1882630	A	0.8683651685714722	We can also represent a scattering experiment as a lock protocol.
1884030	1889718	A	0.8697587847709656	So here's a representation of scattering as a lock protocol.
1889814	1900494	A	0.8399145007133484	And you can see all I've done is cut that previous boundary at the division between a one and a two.
1900692	1914290	A	0.8765925765037537	And I've then extended it in some external time, the time that is counted by Bob's clock, not by Alice's clock.
1914950	1917250	A	0.8271667957305908	That's what's meant by external.
1917910	1923718	A	0.8811242580413818	And I've relabeled Alice two as Alice one at a later time.
1923804	1936300	A	0.890186071395874	So now what Alice is doing is communicating with her past self, or a one is communicating with her future self, and they're each doing something different.
1937470	1944490	A	0.8394347429275513	A one is executing a procedure that in the laboratory we call state preparation.
1945470	1953450	A	0.9007509350776672	She's preparing a state that we'll call in, which is just the initial state of some scattering experiment.
1953530	1965220	A	0.8857177495956421	So, for example, at the LHC, N is some state of two protons that are portaling around the ring at the LHC at close to the speed of light.
1966790	1975494	A	0.9152576327323914	And Alice, then later on at T plus delta, t is doing a different kind of quantum process.
1975612	1986730	A	0.9100731015205383	She's analyzing the data coming out of something like the Atlas detector, which is a multiparticle counter that's located at the LHC.
1987550	1997120	A	0.9036415815353394	So they share a quantum channel, which is the scattering channel that takes the incoming state and produces the outgoing state.
1997810	2017006	A	0.8182685971260071	And I recall from the very first session, as Feynman told us, to understand this transition from in to out, we have to integrate over all possible paths that are consistent with conservation of spin.
2017038	2019970	A	0.8434367179870605	Holicity basically momentum plus spin.
2022010	2030790	A	0.8318506479263306	All the different spins that are relevant in a high energy physics experiment, including things like Lepton number, which is basically a spin.
2032490	2033858	A	0.721057653427124	Now, how do we know?
2033964	2036330	A	0.751067578792572	How do we know what we have to conserve?
2036750	2048442	A	0.8047884702682495	We know what we have to conserve because Alice is doing the experiment has a classical memory that allows her to remember what she prepared.
2048586	2064770	A	0.9015698432922363	She can remember that what she did back in the past was set to protons counterrotating in the LHC, and they had certain energies, and so they had certain momenta, and they were protons, so they had certain spin variables.
2065510	2071670	A	0.7933092713356018	All of that has to be remembered to make any sense of the output of the detectors.
2072570	2079240	A	0.7775789499282837	And so to actually come up with a measured state that makes sense.
2080410	2087078	A	0.6216297149658203	And very often this memory channel is neglected by physicists.
2087174	2089980	A	0.9088213443756104	And I'm going to pause here and let Andrew ask a question.
2092110	2093078	C	0.8918594717979431	Thank you, Chris.
2093174	2102682	C	0.8702936172485352	So does this imply that every time you have a log channel, the quantum part is a scattering picture, like a unitary evolution?
2102746	2109970	C	0.9017684459686279	Even in the earlier EPR picture, is that quantum channel portion always a unitary evolution scattering picture?
2110310	2111300	C	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
2114310	2127510	A	0.7351721525192261	Yes, for essentially the reason that defined a classical channel, you're always assuming you have something that's protected from decoherence by the environment.
2128250	2140730	A	0.49574780464172363	So, yeah, if you're doing an EPR experiment, you have to assume that you don't have any environmental decoherence between the source and the detectors.
2141630	2166740	A	0.5628378391265869	And similarly, when you're doing a scattering experiment, you have to make the assumption that the environment is not reaching in there and messing with the outgoing state that you're going to see, or reaching in and messing with the incoming state and changing it in some way that repepes it in a way that you don't know, that you have no knowledge of.
2167190	2175640	A	0.7871683835983276	So, yes, you're making a fairly strong antidecornce assumption in any of these settings when you're talking about having a quantum channel.
2178090	2179720	A	0.8236514329910278	Does that answer the question?
2180650	2181014	C	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
2181052	2181734	C	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
2181852	2182920	A	0.8942707777023315	Okay, great.
2183530	2198650	A	0.8067331910133362	So we can think of lock, we can think of scattering as Locke, and I just wanted to now emphasize that effectively.
2198730	2202682	A	0.8269546627998352	What Locke is implementing is two parallel memories.
2202746	2209330	A	0.8606526851654053	A classical memory, which, as we said in the case of scattering, is memory for preparation.
2209910	2219940	A	0.8916705250740051	In the EPR case, it's memory for preparation for what the experimental setup is, for what the instructions for doing the experiment are.
2220890	2227058	A	0.8380809426307678	And we also have a quantum channel, which is effectively another memory.
2227234	2230280	A	0.806728184223175	It's something that's extended through time.
2230970	2237190	A	0.7696436643600464	And again, it's implemented by the environment, implemented by Bob, and it involves Bob's.
2237270	2238570	A	0.656798779964447	Clock ticking.
2239550	2248110	A	0.8089759945869446	So whenever we have two memories in parallel, we can construct an error correcting code.
2248180	2251760	A	0.8049107789993286	So think of a simple classical error correcting code.
2252610	2258026	A	0.8802396059036255	For example, the use of parity bits in exchanging digital data.
2258148	2277190	A	0.7506873607635498	So if I send you a bit string classically, and I send it to you two or three times, so there's some redundancy in my signal and I send you a parity bit, I say, okay, add up your bit string, and the result should be one.
2277340	2279160	A	0.5847921371459961	It's one on my side.
2279850	2283830	A	0.7579269409179688	If you add it up and you get zero, there's an error someplace.
2284270	2286806	A	0.821780264377594	You can use that parity bit to detect errors.
2286838	2300666	A	0.6289924383163452	So you can throw out the bit strings that you receive that have parity of zero and say, oh, the environment interfered somehow with the signal, or some eavesdropper interfered with the signal.
2300698	2302462	A	0.6507503986358643	It made a mistake, or something like that.
2302516	2309294	A	0.6581701636314392	So this corresponds to environmental decoherence not being a good assumption.
2309422	2314180	A	0.7413506507873535	Even though it's classical, environmental interference is not a good assumption in this case.
2315510	2319666	A	0.7484117746353149	So a quantum error correct encoder is basically the same idea.
2319768	2333690	A	0.8541902899742126	I use some feature of the fact that I have two different memories and that I'm encoding something in time.
2333840	2344940	A	0.853584349155426	I'm encoding multiple replicates of something in time to provide a way of checking to make sure that I'm sending the correct message.
2346610	2361650	A	0.8874222040176392	So I can, for example, consider the message to be my classical memory and consider the quantum process as a process that tests that memory.
2362230	2367300	A	0.8155454993247986	So I remember that I need to do experiment X, and I will get result Y.
2367830	2374440	A	0.8856233954429626	I actually do experiment X on this quantum channel and see if I get result Y.
2376010	2379320	A	0.8437706828117371	And if I don't get result Y, then something's wrong.
2380570	2389450	A	0.8852900862693787	Either I can't trust the quantum channel or I've remembered my preparation conditions incorrectly.
2389790	2394220	A	0.8766077160835266	So I'm using one memory to check the accuracy of the other.
2394830	2411378	A	0.6981623768806458	And this using something about the environment, some channel in the environment to check memory is absolutely ubiquitous, and we use it all the time.
2411464	2421910	A	0.586601972579956	So, for example, look around your room, and your room hopefully looks more or less the same now that it did at the start of this session.
2423050	2425830	A	0.9314591288566589	And that's very reassuring.
2426730	2434570	A	0.6213828325271606	It reassures you that something's not happening in the environment that's dangerous and disturbing.
2435150	2447870	A	0.5174486041069031	And if you couldn't do that, if your environment was constantly changing and there was no familiarity about the environment, you wouldn't be able to check your memory.
2448450	2449406	A	0.5123436450958252	You wouldn't be able to.
2449428	2450590	A	0.7323837876319885	Check your sanity.
2451410	2460494	A	0.6586275100708008	So even though we don't think about our local environments as effectively an error correcting code, that's exactly how we use it.
2460532	2470180	A	0.7814586162567139	We use stigmurgic memory or memory out there in the environment as a way of checking our own memories and assuring that our memory is okay.
2473180	2476650	A	0.8061829805374146	So I talked a little bit about quantum security.
2477420	2481064	A	0.8345751166343689	Here's how quantum security system works again.
2481102	2482520	A	0.769521951675415	It's a lock protocol.
2483660	2498720	A	0.8803519010543823	We have some classical signal that can be thought of as a code or a key or a one time pad, for example, that encodes a way of doing experiments.
2499380	2507890	A	0.7481136918067932	And once that's been exchanged, assuming it's secure, then we can use the quantum channel to communicate information.
2508500	2514308	A	0.8783590197563171	And the classical channel has told us what we have to do with that quantum channel.
2514394	2521184	A	0.9112593531608582	We have to make certain kinds of measurements at, say, particular clock times as measured.
2521312	2529000	A	0.8082491755485535	And we'll get information sent from the past, from the sender.
2530060	2550130	A	0.65739905834198	And the classical channel protects the quantum channel from adversarial agents, because anything that an adversarial agent does to the quantum channel, if some agent tries to eavesdrop, for example, on the quantum channel, they'll disrupt the quantum channel.
2550580	2559388	A	0.7185356616973877	And the results of our measurement will not be what's expected given the protocol that we run, that we have run.
2559574	2571380	A	0.6097615361213684	So quantum communication is secured by the fact that interfering with some entangled state actually destroys the state so it's detectable.
2572040	2580360	A	0.5228008031845093	We can always know if someone is trying to disrupt our communications, which isn't true if we just have two classical channels.
2581020	2584468	A	0.6657748818397522	Charlie can always intercept a message and then recreate it.
2584574	2588110	A	0.613613486289978	And that's not possible with the quantum channel.
2590720	2600130	A	0.8491942286491394	So let's refold this diagram so that we've taken the external time back out of it.
2601300	2609712	A	0.8454391360282898	And we have this picture where the two components of Alice are just interacting via their shared boundary with their environment.
2609776	2617190	A	0.6218103170394897	Bob and now we can see that the source of redundancy is not time, it's the boundary itself.
2619320	2634940	A	0.8692847490310669	Just sharing the boundary allows Alice's components, a one and a two, to put copies of the same information on different places on the boundary.
2635520	2640510	A	0.580695390701294	So the boundary now becomes a resource for redundant storage of information.
2641360	2666740	A	0.8970203995704651	So Alice one and Alice two can use different parts of the boundary to check what other parts of the boundary, say, to check the information that's encoded on other parts of the boundary so they can define an error correct encode on the boundary itself using this lock protocol.
2669320	2710710	A	0.7849321365356445	So I just want to leave you with this idea that using classical and quantum channels together allows us to define error correcting codes on boundaries that we share as separate agents and leave you to think about what shared measurements, what shared quantum reference frames let us as agents see the same things.
2713560	2718580	A	0.8401980400085449	And this is what we'll talk about next time in September.
2719400	2741980	A	0.8668866157531738	We'll talk specifically about how space provides us with an error correcting code and try to understand why space is treated as emergent from something else, basically from communication in most of quantum gravity.
2742400	2744270	A	0.9706712365150452	So thank you very much.
2744880	2752716	A	0.8258086442947388	I encourage you to use the interactive QA and to attend the discussion sessions, and we'll see you in September.
2752908	2753890	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
2757940	2758690	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
2760120	2763780	B	0.9721819162368774	Chris, thank you for the lecture.
2764280	2768950	B	0.8959726691246033	Andrew, do you have any remarks or questions?
2770040	2771750	C	0.6491942405700684	Not right now, thank you.
2773320	2778116	B	0.7990455031394958	I'll just ask a few quick questions and if anyone has one, quickly in the live chat.
2778228	2789224	B	0.8720823526382446	So you mentioned the tick of the clock, and in active inference, we often hold up side by side both the discrete time models and the continuous time models.
2789272	2796460	B	0.8626919984817505	So do clocks have to tick discreetly or how do we think about continuous time modeling.
2799700	2801036	A	0.8716915845870972	In this quantum setting?
2801068	2816100	A	0.8611997961997986	They do have to tick discreetly because one has to be able to distinguish Alice's preparation of the qubits on her boundary from Bob's measurements of the qubits on the boundary.
2817640	2827130	A	0.5408663153648376	And this process can be extremely fast with respect to any kind of sense of macroscopic time.
2829260	2836060	A	0.724977970123291	Your eyes are responding to photons in, I think it's hundreds of femtoseconds.
2837440	2853760	A	0.5458443760871887	So the discrete transitions that are effectively time measurements for you are at that very fast molecular timescale, much, much faster than our typical clocks.
2855300	2865860	A	0.7838494777679443	Now, when we try to do very fast timing, we're constructing a faster clock than that, but it's a clock that we can only observe indirectly.
2870640	2871292	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
2871426	2871916	B	0.584351658821106	Okay.
2872018	2892390	B	0.6824404001235962	Now this one maybe connects a little bit to application, but with all the developments happening in theory, some of which you're reviewing here and also in practice with quantum computation, and then keeping in mind this distinction sorry, I've lost you back.
2897440	2898936	A	0.629356861114502	I've lost you, Daniel.
2899048	2901388	B	0.7216060161590576	Okay, we'll wait till you're back.
2901554	2902460	B	0.6521875262260437	I can see you.
2902530	2902908	A	0.49361860752105713	No.
2902994	2903724	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
2903922	2904364	A	0.4896698594093323	All right.
2904402	2905340	A	0.5121455192565918	Just repeat.
2906560	2906972	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2907026	2937210	B	0.8032544851303101	So so given these rapid and ongoing developments in theory and practice related to quantum information science and quantum information security, how are people using this distinction of the classical stigmagic memory and then the quantum cognitive process to anticipate how to develop information systems that are reliable going forward?
2941520	2954880	A	0.6568980813026428	I don't know of any instances in which thinking about quantum cognition has entered directly into any design of communication systems.
2955940	2961360	A	0.5451056361198425	The ability of humans to interact with these systems is just assumed.
2962500	2976928	A	0.8173528909683228	So it's just assumed that the user can interact with, say, a computer interface, which is the sort of interface that will be provided or is provided to any quantum computer.
2977114	2985770	A	0.7672954797744751	So if you think about a quantum computer, a practical quantum computer, it has classical interfaces front and back.
2986700	2999196	A	0.8543115258216858	So in thinking about interacting with the computer, I'm giving it some classical problem statement, for example, and asking for some classical answer.
2999298	3003520	A	0.8435017466545105	And what it's going to give me is a probability distribution of classical answers.
3004500	3011520	A	0.7280954718589783	But I can, by running the calculation many times, make that probability distribution fairly tight.
3016130	3020340	A	0.6733492612838745	Yeah, I don't know of anyone talking about quantum BCIs at this point.
3021110	3022900	A	0.5385416746139526	It'd be an interesting question.
3027030	3036450	B	0.6647663712501526	Was it always understood these sorts of blind spots and axioms associated with classical communication.
3037190	3046826	B	0.9052088260650635	Was it developed as kind of like a proposal or like a special case and more unpacking was left for later?
3046928	3050730	B	0.6685211658477783	Or are these blind spots things that we're now coming into awareness of?
3050800	3054170	B	0.8943330645561218	Given what we're learning in the quantum information sciences?
3055890	3058560	A	0.6966660022735596	I think we're learning how serious they are.
3059970	3064720	A	0.5588160753250122	But they were certainly recognized even by Bohr in his 1928 paper.
3065490	3070050	A	0.9702916741371155	And that's a very good paper, too.
3070200	3074194	A	0.8664528131484985	It's called the present state of quantum theory or something like that.
3074232	3079410	A	0.6351187229156494	And it's in Nature, and it's available on the web somewhere.
3081050	3082760	A	0.732697606086731	I have a copy of it.
3083610	3098010	A	0.8871892094612122	But it was written, in a sense, as Bohr's summary of the 1927 Solve Conference, which was the conference at which everyone doing quantum theory at that time got together to talk about their results.
3098990	3116566	A	0.5426639318466187	And in it, Bohr essentially presents what came to be the Copenhagen interpretation, which I think is probably unfairly called an interpretation.
3116698	3122850	A	0.9040156602859497	It's sort of the Copenhagen Pragmatic stance toward quantum theory.
3123670	3137320	A	0.7868683338165283	And essentially what Bohr says is that if we're going to do science, we have to assume that people can talk to each other.
3138650	3152010	A	0.791803240776062	And if we're going to do science, we have to assume that there are instruments that we can manipulate and have reasonable confidence that we know what manipulation we've done.
3152080	3161200	A	0.660929799079895	So if I turn a knob from one to two, I have to be reasonably confident that I'm making a particular change that I can understand.
3162690	3171170	A	0.7172571420669556	And we have to have reasonable confidence that different laboratories can replicate the same experiment.
3172390	3181560	A	0.6080203652381897	And if we think about any of those assumptions in purely quantum theoretic terms, then all sorts of questions are raised, right?
3182010	3184178	A	0.7120674252510071	Every quantum system is unique.
3184354	3188870	A	0.8138592839241028	We have the no Cloning theorem, so every scientific instrument is unique.
3189690	3194934	A	0.5849124789237976	So there's no such thing as exactly replicating an experiment.
3195062	3195740	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3196350	3202460	A	0.7868348360061646	That's a coarse grained description of what I've done with a completely unique quantum system.
3202990	3207646	A	0.4885547459125519	And my brain, of course, is unique, and yours is too.
3207668	3209360	A	0.6222584843635559	And everyone else's is.
3210050	3217070	A	0.6127434968948364	So talking about us sharing a language is essentially a coarse grained assumption.
3217910	3225710	A	0.8927938342094421	And what the Copenhagen stance is all about is coarse graining yielding effective classicality?
3225870	3234840	A	0.8416845798492432	Or what that really means is coarse graining yielding a description that we can use in the language that we understand?
3235770	3252250	A	0.688687264919281	So these are very, very old issues that have been recognized for a long time, but I think in part because of the disaster of shut up and calculate, they haven't really been talked about in the classroom.
3254990	3255546	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
3255648	3258270	B	0.8523327112197876	I'll just read short questions from the chat.
3258930	3264190	B	0.8577327132225037	We can pass them to the discussion section, but there's a lot of great diverse questions.
3264340	3267680	A	0.5344897508621216	So Alexi wrote, I think I've lost you again.
3268470	3270318	A	0.6803101897239685	The revenge of zoom.
3270494	3277570	B	0.9075426459312439	Well, we looked at the chart earlier where, like, Bob was talking to Alice, the Unidirectional.
3280550	3281570	B	0.48382776975631714	Okay, okay.
3281720	3282978	B	0.7503350973129272	The Unidirectional.
3283074	3285640	B	0.8243196606636047	The third party is recording it, I'm sure.
3286410	3298038	B	0.6187739372253418	Alexi wrote, regarding the environment being used for error correction, a symptom of derealization in psychological trauma breakdown.
3298214	3301690	B	0.9252707362174988	We don't recognize the environment around us and it's scary.
3304350	3305340	A	0.5342625379562378	Makes sense.
3305810	3306750	B	0.5342625379562378	Makes sense.
3306900	3307566	A	0.4896698594093323	All right.
3307668	3308778	B	0.7288721203804016	From Bala.
3308874	3309802	B	0.9430091977119446	Nice presentation.
3309866	3315994	B	0.8508411645889282	I heard Chris say entangled states are LOCC for a specific reference frame.
3316122	3321730	B	0.8709683418273926	Is this entanglement unitary or is it related to the numbers of degrees of freedom?
3327320	3331270	A	0.7774385213851929	I think the quick answer would be both.
3332940	3339720	A	0.7762482762336731	If you have a complex system with many degrees of freedom, some can be entangled while others aren't.
3341500	3345500	A	0.7902852892875671	It depends on what parts of the state are separable.
3347040	3357500	A	0.7558193802833557	So again, entanglement is just a statement about components of a joint state that factor or don't.
3359700	3368000	A	0.8052957653999329	So you can have a joint state that looks separable along some dimensions, but in other dimensions.
3368580	3377190	A	0.6383504271507263	The other big complication here is that whether a state looks entangled depends on the reference frames that you use to measure it with.
3378920	3388896	A	0.7999400496482849	And if you pick entangled reference frames, then what we ordinarily think of as separable, as entangled states become separable.
3389088	3391270	A	0.8318151831626892	So you can move entanglement around.
3393800	3394524	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
3394682	3411360	B	0.8695809841156006	Okay, from Roland Rodriguez is the discrete temporality only within the context of a given holographic screen interface with time being bracketed otherwise beyond interface systems, is continuity or discretion kept agnostic?
3414900	3419650	A	0.6662660837173462	I think if I understand the question correctly, it's yes.
3420840	3434280	A	0.8078200817108154	If I don't draw any boundaries, I just have the joint state, then the evolution is unitary and in a sense time plays no role.
3434940	3443720	A	0.7509324550628662	And if unitary evolution is perfectly time symmetric, so time actually drops out altogether.
3445840	3446204	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
3446242	3448780	A	0.867766261100769	So to talk about time, we have to draw boundaries.
3449280	3449740	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
3449810	3452620	B	0.6755558848381042	Time must have a stop huxley.
3453040	3466604	B	0.8416455388069153	And I'll ask one last question from the appropriately monikered question quanderer all communication is abductive is a sentiment that I've been using to develop some arguments.
3466652	3468210	B	0.842515230178833	Does that scan for you?
3469560	3474260	B	0.8802304863929749	How do we connect what we're discussing here with quantum to abductive logic?
3477640	3482792	A	0.6847189664840698	Yeah, I could go along with that.
3482846	3484330	A	0.6410850286483765	I'd want a lot more detail.
3486860	3490564	A	0.7450466156005859	All communication is essentially analogical.
3490692	3491752	A	0.7176121473312378	I would agree with that.
3491806	3492410	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
3493900	3494840	B	0.6890372037887573	Andrew?
3497440	3497852	C	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
3497906	3498670	C	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3499280	3503500	C	0.8614330291748047	So going back to the picture where the scattering picture?
3504320	3512716	C	0.7285197377204895	So we have so far everything is topological and certainly induces breaking the boundary in different sectors.
3512748	3516396	C	0.8628066182136536	I suppose it induces a topology on the boundary.
3516588	3521590	C	0.8334476351737976	Now, I had a couple of questions as for the geometry, and this might be getting ahead.
3524200	3529104	C	0.9173250198364258	Is it an emergent property of those channels between different boundary sectors?
3529232	3533850	C	0.8119372129440308	And if that's the case, then what does it mean to have a QRF or space?
3537660	3548750	A	0.6780682802200317	Yeah, this is really the topic for September, but you do point out the fact that it's something of a chicken and egg situation.
3551040	3570980	A	0.8588480949401855	The way I think of it is, I suppose to choose the chicken side and think about what kind of reference frame does the agent have to implement to see space on their boundary.
3572040	3576468	A	0.7736837267875671	And the reason I think about it that way is that's a question?
3576554	3579360	A	0.7265492081642151	I want to be able to ask about biological systems.
3579520	3584760	A	0.5738105773925781	And this actually gets into probably what won't be talked about till October.
3585420	3610560	A	0.8918752074241638	But I want to be able to ask essentially a phylogenetic question of what sorts of organisms, where in the lineage from Luca do we find systems that are able to assign spatial coordinates to their boundaries and what coordinates come first?
3610710	3647630	A	0.7492344975471497	And I suspect that sort of discrete location names with no metric come first that a system can talk about, for example, this part of their membrane versus that part of their membrane without even having any ability to say, how far apart they are and that some sort of metric representation of this angular space comes later and that a radial space comes even later than that.
3648080	3649928	A	0.6721720099449158	That's, at this point, speculation.
3650024	3662400	A	0.793714165687561	But I think these are questions that we can end up asking given the right kind of formalism and the right understanding of what it means to be able to make a spatial measurement.
3663220	3670452	C	0.9166415929794312	So the conjecture is that the metric would emerge from a discrete network metric of counting ticks sort of thing.
3670506	3673236	A	0.6109300851821899	Yeah, I think that's correct.
3673338	3682396	A	0.8329467177391052	And the sort of symmetries of space that we see are very much tied up with object identity.
3682528	3696080	A	0.5394097566604614	So if we think about something like rotational symmetry let's see, I should stop screen sharing.
3698680	3707300	A	0.5549578666687012	So I've got this object, right, and I can do this, and I say, oh, space has this rotational symmetry.
3708040	3712744	A	0.8131664395332336	But for me to say that, I have to recognize that this is the same object, right?
3712862	3720010	A	0.8115645051002502	I have to implement object persistence, which we all learn to do when we're nine months old or something.
3720880	3742480	A	0.7972601056098938	But we tend to regard those as separate things as we learn object persistence, because space is rotationally symmetric, but we can view it the other way around, that space is rotationally symmetric for me because I implement these constraints that are called object persistence.
3745060	3761240	B	0.8435649275779724	Do you think we can understand phylogenetics as a whole, as a kind of scattering experiment, like the high energy Leuka event and then dissipating and propagating in a very tangled bank?
3762780	3773388	A	0.7059789299964905	Well, I do want to be able to understand phylogeny in exactly the same terms as embryology, and Mike Levin and I have published papers about that.
3773474	3782030	A	0.8134220838546753	We should be able to view the lineage of Luca in exactly the same way that we view the lineage of the Zygote that produced us.
3783220	3795330	C	0.7513680458068848	So that's why it's no coincidence that during pregnancy, the development of the embryo mirrors evolution in terms of the parts that are developed first.
3796840	3810810	A	0.7625384330749512	Yeah, this is the old idea that phylogeny and ontogeny are related in some way, which, from an embryonic development point of view, they're certainly analogous in ways.
3813340	3819700	C	0.6692295670509338	Sorry, if I may ask one last question, things should be very quick regarding the weak rotation.
3819780	3828590	C	0.6343066692352295	I'm still a bit unsure how it ties to this diagrammatic notation that we had with quantum channels on show so on.
3831760	3840240	C	0.9201616048812866	In the second session, we briefly talked about the weak rotation being a reversal in the direction of time.
3840310	3842960	C	0.941162645816803	Is there any relation to today's session?
3845880	3862388	A	0.876319944858551	Yeah, whenever we think about the flow of time as driven by the input output cycle the input output cycle?
3862484	3869064	A	0.8186758756637573	For agents separated by a boundary, there's always a sign change.
3869182	3869560	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
3869630	3872460	A	0.8157563805580139	My input is your output, and vice versa.
3873200	3899540	A	0.8503307700157166	So when we think about the bob's clock ticking, when Alice does something, his direction of time, in a sense, points with respect to the boundary opposite to hers, but that's only with respect to the boundary.
3900600	3905270	A	0.8509527444839478	He sees information flowing in, and she sees information flowing in.
3907160	3912980	A	0.8776242136955261	That's the only point being made here about the WIC rotation as an operation.
3914600	3915590	C	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3916600	3917940	B	0.8918594717979431	Thank you, Chris.
3918520	3922668	B	0.9765040278434753	Very well appreciated by the viewers and by us.
3922754	3935112	B	0.9700947403907776	So we'll certainly look forward to reviewing the q a, and everybody is welcome and encouraged to join for the participatory discussion in about two weeks on Saturday.
3935256	3938270	B	0.7429341077804565	So till next time.
3938880	3940300	A	0.8092430830001831	All right, thank you.
3940450	3940680	A	0.8810354471206665	Cheers.
