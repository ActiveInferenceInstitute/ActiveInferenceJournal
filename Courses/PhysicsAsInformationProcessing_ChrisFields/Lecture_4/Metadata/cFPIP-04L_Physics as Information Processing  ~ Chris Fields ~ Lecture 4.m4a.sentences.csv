4230	4780	1	A	0.61	You.
7390	9306	2	B	0.76166	Hello and welcome, everyone.
9488	10422	3	B	1.0	This is physics.
10486	14806	4	B	0.99764	As information processing session four on communicating observers.
14918	17740	5	B	0.64155	It's the 10 August 2023.
18110	20390	6	B	0.99775	Chris looking forward to this lecture.
20470	21580	7	B	0.59	Off to you.
23470	26810	8	A	0.99997	Thank you, Daniel, and welcome to this session.
27310	30734	9	A	0.99987	As Daniel said, this is about out communicating observers.
30862	35540	10	A	1.0	And fasten your seatbelts because we have a lot to cover in the next hour.
36870	39170	11	A	0.99104	So just to do a quick review.
39320	55850	12	A	0.8619	We've been talking about quantum information theory and we've been talking about it in the simplest possible setting of two systems, Alice and Bob, that exchange information through their mutual boundary.
56350	60118	13	A	1.0	And we've assumed that everything is finite dimensional.
60214	65130	14	A	0.99928	So we don't need to worry about infinite energy transfer across this boundary.
65790	72682	15	A	0.99	And of course, we assume conservation of energy so there are no sources or sinks in either of the systems.
72746	87250	16	A	0.71393	Alice and Bob and we emphasize that this way of depicting things as topological we're not assuming any background geometry, no sort of spatial embedding which is going to become very important in this session.
89750	102706	17	A	0.99885	In the last session, we talked about how the boundary, which I'll always call B can be thought of as a channel that comprises N qubits that are independent.
102818	113450	18	A	0.99	And Alice and Bob each can prepare and measure those qubits and they can always choose independently their reference frames for doing so.
113520	121070	19	A	0.83938	So how they define up and down when they're measuring a spin with effectively a Zspin operator.
121810	124430	20	A	0.97	To interact with these qubits.
125810	130690	21	A	0.99998	We talked a little bit about the free energy principle and its quantum formulation.
131510	143250	22	A	1.0	And the principle basically says that interacting systems will behave in a way that aligns their reference frames and that they therefore asymptotically approach entanglement.
143410	147906	23	A	0.99631	So the FEP is a classical limit of the principle of unitarity.
148098	161100	24	A	0.99	And that's one reason for studying quantum information to learn more about the FEP and so to learn more about active inference and what the theory of active inference says about agents.
162990	172880	25	A	0.53	And last time, we talked a lot about the constraints that are imposed by a limited free energy supply on any agent.
174050	191626	26	A	0.79722	Recall that we talked about the fact that in the absence of sources of free energy within an agent so as long as you conserve energy globally that the free energy that each agent uses has to come from its environment.
191758	193590	27	A	0.93873	That's clearly true for us.
193660	199510	28	A	0.85469	We have to consume oxygen and eat food and things like that to keep running as systems.
200490	216970	29	A	1.0	And we discussed a little bit this theorem that if two reference frames or quantum processes, q One and Q Two don't commute, they have to be implemented by compartments that communicate classically.
217050	219520	30	A	1.0	And we'll use this extensively today.
220450	233970	31	A	0.99999	But the bottom line last time was that physics alone gives us compartmentalization in systems whenever the systems are complex enough to have multiple kinds of measurements that they can't deploy simultaneously.
236390	254470	32	A	0.99992	So where we're going today, we're going to start from this place we left off last time of the possibility of agents that are compartmentalized and into compartments that have to communicate classically.
255070	270830	33	A	0.99501	So we're going to talk about agents that can be compartmentalized into multiple subagents that share an environment, the environment consisting of Bob and how those agents talk about that shared environment.
271490	274000	34	A	0.99996	So the motivation for this is simple.
274450	278250	35	A	0.58913	It's that what we do all the time is a group activity.
278330	283470	36	A	0.96	And what we're doing right now is a group activity that involves sharing an environment.
283550	287060	37	A	0.99012	What's shown on this screen and talking about it.
287430	296886	38	A	1.0	And the whole post session discussion process will be another example of just that sort of thing.
297068	313130	39	A	0.50921	So to talk about science at all or to talk about any kind of social relations or to talk about anything other than solipsism, we have to be able to talk about how multiple agents communicate about some shared environment.
313630	318000	40	A	1.0	And so that's what we're going to develop a formal way of talking about.
318690	323920	41	A	1.0	And there are two things to notice right off the top about this.
324610	331310	42	A	0.53	One is that the way we've defined interactions at boundaries, they're effectively instantaneous.
331470	337758	43	A	0.9999	So each agent, remember, interacts with its boundary with some set of operators.
337854	345326	44	A	0.8	And what those operators do is effectively measure each operator effectively measures the spin of a qubit.
345518	347940	45	A	0.99998	So this is a very fast process.
350390	370762	46	A	0.56	The other thing that we then need to notice is that if we have two agents and they're communicating with each other classically, then they're going to be using degrees of freedom of their shared environment in order to communicate.
370906	373278	47	A	1.0	And that's exactly what we're doing right now.
373364	379718	48	A	0.99999	For example, we're using degrees of freedom of the Internet to communicate.
379914	391140	49	A	0.84925	I'm using degrees of freedom of the local atmosphere to talk to my microphone and I'm using degrees of freedom of the local photon field to see my screen.
392090	403122	50	A	0.90764	So all communication between agents and certainly all classical communication between agents uses degrees of freedom of the environment.
403186	410090	51	A	0.99	And the environment, remember, is the other system, Bob, that's on the other side of that shared boundary.
410750	420698	52	A	0.99577	So we're going to be interested in how components of Alice use Bob as a communication channel and in fact, as multiple communication channels.
420874	429558	53	A	0.98	And I just wanted to quote my colleague and friend Mike Levin in his statement that all intelligence is composite.
429754	449270	54	A	0.99	All of us, all organisms, even single cells, are composite systems that comprise many different agents that are able to make different kinds of measurements and execute different kinds of actions and so have to communicate classically.
450010	458780	55	A	0.99988	So we're talking about all of life here as well as all of social systems and ecosystems and such things as that.
460270	470490	56	A	0.99996	So the first thing I want to do today is simplify the notation so that we don't have to draw quite such complicated diagrams.
470650	474618	57	A	0.99913	So the picture on the left here is a picture from the last session.
474794	490900	58	A	0.75	It shows the structure of a very simple agent that makes some measurements using a reference frame called e and then writes some results of those measurements to memory using a reference frame called y.
491450	500662	59	A	1.0	And those two processes are connected by an internal clock that ticks between the input process and the output process.
500796	508490	60	A	1.0	And the clock tick corresponds to the expenditure of free energy to write information irreversibly on the boundary.
508830	515478	61	A	0.99989	So the memories are actually written on the boundary because that's where classical information lives in this theory.
515654	530930	62	A	0.99989	So you can think of this whole process from e through the clock and back to y as a single quantum process or as a quantum computation that maps some sector e of the boundary to some sector Y of the boundary.
531590	544150	63	A	1.0	And so we can represent it in this much simpler way that's over on the right side as some process Q that maps some sector on the boundary to some other sector on the boundary.
544650	551030	64	A	1.0	And formally, that process can be thought of as a topological quantum field theory.
551530	553446	65	A	0.99979	Topological here is important.
553548	561660	66	A	0.99987	It's not geometric, it doesn't assume an embedding in space and this will become critically important later on.
562030	573790	67	A	0.93	And the operation of that tqft requires a clock tick or it incorporates a tick of this internal clock.
574370	592530	68	A	0.98	And we can do this because we were able to prove jim Glazeburg and Tanino Marciano and I were able to prove last year that we can always represent a quantum reference frame as a topological quantum field theory.
592690	599526	69	A	1.0	And this just illustrates the two kinds of transformations between quantum reference frames that are important.
599628	622730	70	A	0.99999	We can take one and divide it into two pieces that commute or we can take a two part reference frame and we can swap in another part that doesn't commute with the part that we've swapped it in for but that does commute with the remainder of the reference frame.
622810	637394	71	A	0.99993	So here R is the reference component of some object identification system and we can swap in some different way of looking at the object once we've identified it.
637432	661690	72	A	0.99878	So, for example, if the object that we're identifying is a box that can measure both Z spin and X spin, then P and Q can be the z spin and x spin settings on that box that allow us to effectively rotate the filter from this way to that way so that we measure vertical spin versus horizontal spin.
662110	663562	73	A	0.99	And that's really it.
663616	669194	74	A	0.96	I mean, those are the ways that one can transform quantum reference frames.
669322	687810	75	A	1.0	Of course, we could do arbitrarily many compositions of this kind of transformation to do something very complicated, but they map very simply to tqfts with the structure and you can construct categories out of this and find a function that's well defined that maps one category to another.
687880	698390	76	A	0.99995	So it's an example of a nice use of categorical techniques for solving a problem that looks difficult but in fact it's very straightforward.
699370	728350	77	A	0.91304	So using this simplified notation, it becomes very easy to see that if we have two systems, alice and Bob on opposite sides of this boundary and we perfectly align their quantum reference frames, which is what the FEP says they will tend to do, then they become entangled.
728790	739940	78	A	0.68	And you can see that they're entangled by seeing that once the reference frames are perfectly aligned, they jointly implement one quantum process.
741610	746630	79	A	0.49	And jointly implementing one quantum process just means you're entangled.
747290	753640	80	A	0.95	The two sides no longer have conditionally independent states.
754190	763930	81	A	0.99978	If one quantum process, which is time reversible, information preserving, is implemented jointly by the two systems.
764510	786158	82	A	0.99985	So a lot of things like this become very simple when we think of these processes as just quantum computations going on inside some system implemented by some system and how those processes relate across some boundary.
786334	792680	83	A	0.9999	So that's what we're going to do for studying communication today.
794410	812454	84	A	1.0	Another thing to recall from a couple of sessions ago, our last session, is that if two reference frames, q one and Q Two commute, we can always join them together to form a single reference frame.
812502	818560	85	A	1.0	And this is just a graphical depiction in this simpler language of how that works.
819250	826862	86	A	1.0	And topologically, there's no distinction between the left side and the right side.
826916	834210	87	A	1.0	What I've done is just squeeze the top two green circles together and the bottom two green circles together into one circle.
834790	840594	88	A	0.99	And that just makes a simple process connecting the top one to the bottom one.
840792	856170	89	A	0.99075	So what we're going to be interested in is situations where this doesn't happen, where Alice consists of two components that execute reference frames that don't commute.
856750	862822	90	A	0.95	And so the two components are conditionally independent.
862886	866410	91	A	0.99999	They do each have free choice of reference frame.
867090	870074	92	A	1.0	And so they have to communicate classically.
870202	877070	93	A	0.99998	They don't share a single quantum process, so they're not entangled.
878130	908006	94	A	1.0	And before we go ahead to do that, I just wanted to remind you of some of the no go theorems that follow from this situation depicted on the right, where we have a single agent executing a single reference frame, a single process, a single kind of measurement, any set of commuting measurements that can be combined into one measurement.
908198	910666	95	A	0.98	And here are some things Alice can't do.
910768	913450	96	A	0.97	And we've talked about some of these previously.
913870	916490	97	A	0.99731	So this is basically a reminder.
917090	927626	98	A	0.84797	But Alice can't, using just one measurement, measure the entanglement entropy across her own boundary.
927818	931442	99	A	0.9955	So Alice can't know that she has an independent state.
931576	935598	100	A	0.99971	She can't know that she's not entangled with Bob.
935774	942360	101	A	0.97	And that's a useful thing to think about philosophically as it applies to you and me.
942810	946360	102	A	0.99984	We can't actually know that we have independent states.
947690	957530	103	A	0.92513	Alice can't measure her own entanglement entropy, so she can't know whether she has components that have to communicate classically.
959630	968430	104	A	0.99946	She can't measure Bob's entanglement entropy, so she can't know whether Bob has compartments that have to communicate classically.
968850	978670	105	A	0.99	And if you think in terms of perception theory, this says Alice can't know whether Bob consists of separate objects that behave classically.
981190	993190	106	A	0.96	Their behavior can look classical to her, but she's not able to determine that their behavior is classical because she can't measure Bob's entanglement entropy.
994410	1014540	107	A	0.99986	She can't measure the dimension of her own boundary and recall from a couple of times ago that the boundary includes some sector that supplies free energy that Alice can't extract information from for further processing, she can only extract free energy from.
1014990	1023360	108	A	0.99261	So she can't measure the dimension of that sector, and so she can't measure the dimension of the whole boundary itself.
1023970	1027646	109	A	0.98	And this, of course, means that she can't measure her own dimension either.
1027748	1036382	110	A	1.0	And of course, she can't measure Bob's dimension, because the only information she can get about Bob is the classical information that's encoded on this boundary.
1036446	1041220	111	A	0.99251	She can't reach past the boundary to see how large a system Bob is.
1041850	1057350	112	A	0.97	And that's clearly connected to this first point, that she can't measure the entanglement entropy across Bob, because the entanglement entropy can only be small if her dimension and Bob's dimension are both much larger than the dimension of the boundary.
1057430	1059740	113	A	0.99644	So that's a condition she can't check.
1061310	1066330	114	A	0.97593	So all of these kind of no go theorems lead off in interesting directions.
1066690	1088610	115	A	0.95	And the only one that we're really going to be interested in here is the third one, the one about measuring Bob's entanglement entropy, because we want to talk specifically about how multiple agents, so multiple components of Alice can access information about Bob's entanglement entropy.
1093050	1101290	116	A	0.68042	Okay, so recall from the end of the last session that the last thing we talked about was classical communication.
1101950	1111920	117	A	1.0	And we talked about the fact that classical communication involves assumptions and pitfalls and that we have to be very careful whenever we talk about it.
1112450	1117178	118	A	1.0	And what we're going to do today is standard practice in physics.
1117274	1127390	119	A	0.98575	We're simply going to stipulate that these components, a one and a two, the separable components of Alice, communicate classically.
1127470	1129202	120	A	1.0	And so we're going to draw it like this.
1129256	1135330	121	A	0.9998	We're going to draw a classical channel between them, and that classical channel passes through Bob.
1135410	1149610	122	A	0.52	It uses degrees of freedom of the ambient photon field or the ambient atmosphere or pieces of paper or email or something like that that's out there in the environment to exchange classical messages.
1150510	1154394	123	A	0.75	And there are a couple of things to note here I haven't even written down here.
1154432	1159322	124	A	0.99999	We're assuming that a one and a two share some language for this classical communication.
1159386	1162320	125	A	0.56914	That's a big assumption, as we talked about last time.
1163810	1168398	126	A	0.99964	But I will note explicitly that classical communication takes time.
1168564	1171554	127	A	0.99964	That's what defines classicality here.
1171592	1176180	128	A	0.68572	It's causal, so it can't work faster than the speed of light.
1177030	1179150	129	A	1.0	This is a topological theory.
1179230	1181102	130	A	1.0	We don't have any embedding geometry.
1181166	1191240	131	A	0.99999	So we can't, at this point, talk about light, which is a relationship between space and time, because we've got time, we've got clocks, but we don't have any space.
1191930	1201900	132	A	0.99519	But we can say that whatever passes through this classical channel requires at least one clock tick on Bob's side.
1202590	1206330	133	A	0.99176	So it's a process that Bob has to execute.
1206930	1210158	134	A	1.0	And executing that process takes time.
1210244	1216318	135	A	0.99989	So getting the signal from me to you on the internet takes some time.
1216484	1220340	136	A	0.53983	So the environment's clock has to tick during that.
1221110	1241686	137	A	1.0	And all of these assumptions bundled together turn out to be a fairly serious set of assumptions and they involve assumptions about fine tuning, about the universe being just right and they should make us nervous and I just want to leave it at that.
1241868	1247142	138	A	0.99999	We always assume with complete a plumb that agents can communicate classically.
1247206	1258442	139	A	0.99997	But it's not a straightforward assumption and it's worth any of you are looking at for interesting research projects can look into the nature of classical communication.
1258506	1266846	140	A	0.71033	It's full of hidden assumptions and surprises and things that aren't at all straightforward even though they look like they ought to be.
1267028	1268590	141	A	0.99999	So there's a challenge.
1269890	1271374	142	A	0.99993	So why do we assume this?
1271412	1273758	143	A	0.99999	Why do we assume classical communication?
1273934	1278930	144	A	0.99838	We do it because we have to if we're going to talk about detecting entanglement.
1280070	1287666	145	A	0.79	And most of you probably know the history of the notion of entanglement.
1287778	1296314	146	A	0.87	It was first noticed by Einstein, Podolski and Rosen ever after called EPR in 1935.
1296512	1309390	147	A	1.0	And they wrote a paper which is infamous and called the EPR Paper in which they argued that the phenomenon of entanglement made no sense and couldn't possibly be physical.
1310050	1320100	148	A	0.99	And since quantum theory included this notion of entanglement, it couldn't possibly be a complete theory of what's going on in the world.
1320710	1331570	149	A	0.98	And Schrodinger replied the same year with a very detailed paper where he introduces, among other things, Schrodinger's cat as a paradox.
1332170	1338498	150	A	0.99	And he explains very clearly what entanglement is and why entanglement follows from quantum theory.
1338674	1347322	151	A	1.0	And he uses that discussion to argue that the classical notion of a physical state is not actually applicable to the world as it is.
1347376	1351050	152	A	0.99997	So he answers the EPR paper very directly.
1352270	1373810	153	A	1.0	And this discussion is currently mostly known as the Bohr Einstein debate because of course Bohr already in 1928 has said had said in print that the classical notion of causality in space and time simply doesn't apply anymore.
1374470	1377646	154	A	1.0	And Einstein objected to that vigorously.
1377838	1385090	155	A	0.64609	But that was 1935 and it was almost 50 years later that entanglement was first observed in the laboratory.
1385170	1398060	156	A	0.99989	Here the 1982 picture is a picture of the interior of Alan Aspet's laboratory when he performed the first entanglement experiment for which he finally won the Nobel Prize last year.
1399790	1409310	157	A	1.0	And these days this kind of experiment is done all over the world and is even done with satellite borne sources.
1412710	1428440	158	A	0.88798	Resource is the key to quantum secured communication, as we'll discuss in quantum cryptography and quantum banking and the quantum internet, all this other stuff that you may have heard of.
1429450	1440570	159	A	0.99991	So before talking more about these experiments, I just want to provide a definition of entanglement.
1442350	1446278	160	A	0.99934	Entangled simply means not separable.
1446374	1447850	161	A	0.99995	That's the definition.
1448270	1459220	162	A	0.99831	So a state, a joint state AB is entangled if and only if it does not factor into two separable states.
1460310	1461426	163	A	1.0	And that's it.
1461528	1462930	164	A	0.53821	That's the definition.
1463830	1484540	165	A	1.0	And the literature, and especially the popular literature, is absolutely rife with hype and various kinds of mischief of entanglement and authors trying to convince you that entanglement is this amazing kind of woo woo thing.
1485310	1500670	166	A	1.0	And whenever you run across that, go back to the definition, entanglement simply means this simple mathematical condition of not separability or a state that isn't factorizable.
1501170	1506346	167	A	1.0	And that means that the state does not display classical conditional independence.
1506538	1509074	168	A	0.99987	So classically, that's the way to think about it.
1509112	1511810	169	A	0.64385	It's a failure of conditional independence.
1512230	1519650	170	A	1.0	And it's ubiquitous in quantum theory, even though it wasn't actually absurd for almost 50 years after it was predicted.
1521130	1524182	171	A	0.98486	So here's what all these experiments look like.
1524236	1535406	172	A	0.94032	They're called Bell EPR experiments, after John Bell, who derived the statistical criterion for detecting entanglement and EPR.
1535458	1544330	173	A	0.48705	Einstein, Podolski and Rosen, who did this as a thought experiment and said, if this occurs in the theory, it can't possibly be real.
1544400	1545900	174	A	0.96	And of course it is real.
1546270	1549390	175	A	0.35067	It's now amply demonstrated by experimentation.
1550050	1551022	176	A	0.94138	Here's how they work.
1551076	1552190	177	A	0.99899	There's a source.
1552930	1557562	178	A	1.0	The source produces a state that is entangled.
1557706	1562050	179	A	1.0	And I've written the typical what's called a Bell state.
1562200	1567906	180	A	0.59924	It's up plus or minus down divided by the square root of two just to normalize it.
1568088	1573350	181	A	0.99987	But up plus or minus down is clearly not the same as up times down.
1573420	1575720	182	A	0.99998	So this is not a separable state.
1576570	1586886	183	A	0.55	And this state propagates outward in space and time to two observers who have independent laboratories, for example, on different continents.
1586998	1602830	184	A	0.70831	In that space based experiment that I showed you the picture of from the COVID of Science a few years ago, 2017, I think, the Tulip observers have freedom to choose their own reference frame, their own Z axis for measuring spin.
1603170	1607550	185	A	0.99995	They do a spin measurement, and they do this over and over and over again.
1607620	1617598	186	A	0.99981	They accumulate statistics and they exchange their results so that they can analyze the joint statistics of their experiment.
1617774	1623938	187	A	1.0	And they check to see whether that joint statistics is consistent with classical probability theory.
1624114	1634090	188	A	1.0	And if it isn't to a statistically significant level, then they've been able to detect entanglement.
1634910	1640086	189	A	1.0	Now, notice that this process requires classical communication.
1640278	1653550	190	A	0.99998	They have to make their independent measurements in their own laboratories, and then they have to exchange results, or one of them has to send results to the other one, or they both have to send their results to some third party.
1653890	1658962	191	A	0.99999	But in all of these cases, they're exchanging some classical data.
1659096	1669730	192	A	1.0	And so we have the assumption that whoever gets that classical data knows the language it was recorded in and so can do a joint analysis.
1670410	1677062	193	A	0.55946	So I'll just show you another picture of this experiment that's in a standard space time diagram here.
1677116	1679830	194	A	0.52109	Time is vertical, space is horizontal.
1681930	1684970	195	A	1.0	The two observers are labeled Alice and Bob.
1686190	1691622	196	A	0.99949	They share a quantum channel that goes from Alice to the source to Bob.
1691686	1693340	197	A	0.94479	That's the entangled state.
1694190	1696082	198	A	0.99986	They do some processing.
1696246	1701194	199	A	1.0	And then one of them here, Bob, sends the results to Alice.
1701322	1703658	200	A	0.99	And that's a classical communication.
1703754	1707600	201	A	0.73	It takes time, and it traverses space.
1708470	1710910	202	A	0.88426	So this step is classical.
1711070	1719250	203	A	0.99984	So this is why we have to assume classical communication to talk about detecting or using entanglement.
1720470	1723640	204	A	0.99979	So now I want to represent this in a different way.
1725770	1728226	205	A	0.99999	Using our little picture earlier.
1728418	1732520	206	A	0.99951	We're going to think of Alice, again as two components, a one and a two.
1733070	1736890	207	A	0.96542	They're separable, so they have to communicate classically.
1737230	1743866	208	A	0.99971	They have a classical channel that goes through Bob, and they also now share some quantum channel.
1743968	1746060	209	A	0.53892	They share an entangled state.
1746670	1749642	210	A	0.99	And the entangled state, of course, is produced by Bob.
1749706	1752030	211	A	0.69	The source is part of Bob.
1752450	1763060	212	A	0.98	And their detectors, if you want to think about it that way, are located on this boundary B, or their interface with the sources on this boundary B.
1763830	1774760	213	A	1.0	And each of them executes a process that accumulates data from the quantum channel and communicates it to the other observer via the classical channel.
1776010	1779842	214	A	1.0	Now, this picture illustrates what's called a lock protocol.
1779986	1784250	215	A	0.86199	Lock means local operations and classical communication.
1784830	1789766	216	A	0.99992	So a one and a two are each operating locally on their boundary.
1789878	1800938	217	A	0.68209	They're making measurements locally on their boundary, and they're communicating via actions locally on their boundary and observations locally on their boundary.
1801034	1806526	218	A	0.9999	So, for example, I'm communicating with my computer here.
1806628	1808958	219	A	0.99997	We can consider it my boundary.
1809134	1823094	220	A	1.0	And stuff is happening in the environment that's implemented by the Internet, and you're receiving those communications locally on your boundary, on your laptop or whatever it is you're using.
1823292	1826360	221	A	0.61498	So that's what local operations means.
1826890	1831890	222	A	0.96	And these protocols specifically involve classical communication.
1831970	1834774	223	A	1.0	And so they're able to detect entanglement.
1834902	1839370	224	A	0.55	And a Bell EPR experiment is just an example of a lock protocol.
1840670	1845974	225	A	1.0	The observers exchange information about how they're going to do their experiments.
1846022	1848202	226	A	0.99948	They're both going to measure D spin.
1848346	1855070	227	A	0.99967	They're going to use independently chosen reference frames, and they're going to look at the output from some agreed upon source.
1855970	1858480	228	A	0.99934	So that's all classically set up.
1858870	1864270	229	A	0.98767	Then they actually make their observations, and then they classically communicate their results.
1864350	1877510	230	A	0.99739	So classical communication front and back lock protocols are not limited to this sort of Bell EPR sort of setting.
1877930	1882630	231	A	0.99998	We can also represent a scattering experiment as a lock protocol.
1884030	1889718	232	A	0.99593	So here's a representation of scattering as a lock protocol.
1889814	1900494	233	A	1.0	And you can see all I've done is cut that previous boundary at the division between a one and a two.
1900692	1914290	234	A	1.0	And I've then extended it in some external time, the time that is counted by Bob's clock, not by Alice's clock.
1914950	1917250	235	A	0.95505	That's what's meant by external.
1917910	1923718	236	A	1.0	And I've relabeled Alice two as Alice one at a later time.
1923804	1936300	237	A	0.99978	So now what Alice is doing is communicating with her past self, or a one is communicating with her future self, and they're each doing something different.
1937470	1944490	238	A	0.63	A one is executing a procedure that in the laboratory we call state preparation.
1945470	1953450	239	A	0.99965	She's preparing a state that we'll call in, which is just the initial state of some scattering experiment.
1953530	1965220	240	A	0.97995	So, for example, at the LHC, N is some state of two protons that are portaling around the ring at the LHC at close to the speed of light.
1966790	1975494	241	A	0.96	And Alice, then later on at T plus delta, t is doing a different kind of quantum process.
1975612	1986730	242	A	0.97588	She's analyzing the data coming out of something like the Atlas detector, which is a multiparticle counter that's located at the LHC.
1987550	1997120	243	A	0.99625	So they share a quantum channel, which is the scattering channel that takes the incoming state and produces the outgoing state.
1997810	2017006	244	A	0.97	And I recall from the very first session, as Feynman told us, to understand this transition from in to out, we have to integrate over all possible paths that are consistent with conservation of spin.
2017038	2019970	245	A	0.49481	Holicity basically momentum plus spin.
2022010	2030790	246	A	0.93	All the different spins that are relevant in a high energy physics experiment, including things like Lepton number, which is basically a spin.
2032490	2033858	247	A	1.0	Now, how do we know?
2033964	2036330	248	A	0.99321	How do we know what we have to conserve?
2036750	2048442	249	A	0.68612	We know what we have to conserve because Alice is doing the experiment has a classical memory that allows her to remember what she prepared.
2048586	2064770	250	A	0.99696	She can remember that what she did back in the past was set to protons counterrotating in the LHC, and they had certain energies, and so they had certain momenta, and they were protons, so they had certain spin variables.
2065510	2071670	251	A	1.0	All of that has to be remembered to make any sense of the output of the detectors.
2072570	2079240	252	A	0.52	And so to actually come up with a measured state that makes sense.
2080410	2087078	253	A	0.99	And very often this memory channel is neglected by physicists.
2087174	2089980	254	A	0.99	And I'm going to pause here and let Andrew ask a question.
2092110	2093078	255	C	0.99938	Thank you, Chris.
2093174	2102682	256	C	0.9846	So does this imply that every time you have a log channel, the quantum part is a scattering picture, like a unitary evolution?
2102746	2109970	257	C	0.99994	Even in the earlier EPR picture, is that quantum channel portion always a unitary evolution scattering picture?
2110310	2111300	258	C	0.99974	Thank you.
2114310	2127510	259	A	0.99951	Yes, for essentially the reason that defined a classical channel, you're always assuming you have something that's protected from decoherence by the environment.
2128250	2140730	260	A	0.88814	So, yeah, if you're doing an EPR experiment, you have to assume that you don't have any environmental decoherence between the source and the detectors.
2141630	2166740	261	A	1.0	And similarly, when you're doing a scattering experiment, you have to make the assumption that the environment is not reaching in there and messing with the outgoing state that you're going to see, or reaching in and messing with the incoming state and changing it in some way that repepes it in a way that you don't know, that you have no knowledge of.
2167190	2175640	262	A	0.99986	So, yes, you're making a fairly strong antidecornce assumption in any of these settings when you're talking about having a quantum channel.
2178090	2179720	263	A	0.99998	Does that answer the question?
2180650	2181014	264	C	0.99957	Yes.
2181052	2181734	265	C	0.99997	Thank you.
2181852	2182920	266	A	0.97193	Okay, great.
2183530	2198650	267	A	0.9971	So we can think of lock, we can think of scattering as Locke, and I just wanted to now emphasize that effectively.
2198730	2202682	268	A	0.78	What Locke is implementing is two parallel memories.
2202746	2209330	269	A	1.0	A classical memory, which, as we said in the case of scattering, is memory for preparation.
2209910	2219940	270	A	0.99865	In the EPR case, it's memory for preparation for what the experimental setup is, for what the instructions for doing the experiment are.
2220890	2227058	271	A	0.99	And we also have a quantum channel, which is effectively another memory.
2227234	2230280	272	A	0.99842	It's something that's extended through time.
2230970	2237190	273	A	0.99	And again, it's implemented by the environment, implemented by Bob, and it involves Bob's.
2237270	2238570	274	A	0.99956	Clock ticking.
2239550	2248110	275	A	0.86074	So whenever we have two memories in parallel, we can construct an error correcting code.
2248180	2251760	276	A	0.99978	So think of a simple classical error correcting code.
2252610	2258026	277	A	0.99938	For example, the use of parity bits in exchanging digital data.
2258148	2277190	278	A	0.99958	So if I send you a bit string classically, and I send it to you two or three times, so there's some redundancy in my signal and I send you a parity bit, I say, okay, add up your bit string, and the result should be one.
2277340	2279160	279	A	0.97145	It's one on my side.
2279850	2283830	280	A	0.99937	If you add it up and you get zero, there's an error someplace.
2284270	2286806	281	A	1.0	You can use that parity bit to detect errors.
2286838	2300666	282	A	0.9999	So you can throw out the bit strings that you receive that have parity of zero and say, oh, the environment interfered somehow with the signal, or some eavesdropper interfered with the signal.
2300698	2302462	283	A	0.76	It made a mistake, or something like that.
2302516	2309294	284	A	0.99988	So this corresponds to environmental decoherence not being a good assumption.
2309422	2314180	285	A	0.99995	Even though it's classical, environmental interference is not a good assumption in this case.
2315510	2319666	286	A	0.99989	So a quantum error correct encoder is basically the same idea.
2319768	2333690	287	A	0.99	I use some feature of the fact that I have two different memories and that I'm encoding something in time.
2333840	2344940	288	A	0.83675	I'm encoding multiple replicates of something in time to provide a way of checking to make sure that I'm sending the correct message.
2346610	2361650	289	A	0.99657	So I can, for example, consider the message to be my classical memory and consider the quantum process as a process that tests that memory.
2362230	2367300	290	A	0.99976	So I remember that I need to do experiment X, and I will get result Y.
2367830	2374440	291	A	1.0	I actually do experiment X on this quantum channel and see if I get result Y.
2376010	2379320	292	A	1.0	And if I don't get result Y, then something's wrong.
2380570	2389450	293	A	1.0	Either I can't trust the quantum channel or I've remembered my preparation conditions incorrectly.
2389790	2394220	294	A	0.99985	So I'm using one memory to check the accuracy of the other.
2394830	2411378	295	A	1.0	And this using something about the environment, some channel in the environment to check memory is absolutely ubiquitous, and we use it all the time.
2411464	2421910	296	A	0.99931	So, for example, look around your room, and your room hopefully looks more or less the same now that it did at the start of this session.
2423050	2425830	297	A	1.0	And that's very reassuring.
2426730	2434570	298	A	1.0	It reassures you that something's not happening in the environment that's dangerous and disturbing.
2435150	2447870	299	A	1.0	And if you couldn't do that, if your environment was constantly changing and there was no familiarity about the environment, you wouldn't be able to check your memory.
2448450	2449406	300	A	1.0	You wouldn't be able to.
2449428	2450590	301	A	1.0	Check your sanity.
2451410	2460494	302	A	0.9998	So even though we don't think about our local environments as effectively an error correcting code, that's exactly how we use it.
2460532	2470180	303	A	0.68763	We use stigmurgic memory or memory out there in the environment as a way of checking our own memories and assuring that our memory is okay.
2473180	2476650	304	A	0.99931	So I talked a little bit about quantum security.
2477420	2481064	305	A	0.71818	Here's how quantum security system works again.
2481102	2482520	306	A	0.99997	It's a lock protocol.
2483660	2498720	307	A	0.99999	We have some classical signal that can be thought of as a code or a key or a one time pad, for example, that encodes a way of doing experiments.
2499380	2507890	308	A	1.0	And once that's been exchanged, assuming it's secure, then we can use the quantum channel to communicate information.
2508500	2514308	309	A	1.0	And the classical channel has told us what we have to do with that quantum channel.
2514394	2521184	310	A	0.99999	We have to make certain kinds of measurements at, say, particular clock times as measured.
2521312	2529000	311	A	1.0	And we'll get information sent from the past, from the sender.
2530060	2550130	312	A	0.99	And the classical channel protects the quantum channel from adversarial agents, because anything that an adversarial agent does to the quantum channel, if some agent tries to eavesdrop, for example, on the quantum channel, they'll disrupt the quantum channel.
2550580	2559388	313	A	1.0	And the results of our measurement will not be what's expected given the protocol that we run, that we have run.
2559574	2571380	314	A	0.85795	So quantum communication is secured by the fact that interfering with some entangled state actually destroys the state so it's detectable.
2572040	2580360	315	A	0.99961	We can always know if someone is trying to disrupt our communications, which isn't true if we just have two classical channels.
2581020	2584468	316	A	0.71884	Charlie can always intercept a message and then recreate it.
2584574	2588110	317	A	0.99	And that's not possible with the quantum channel.
2590720	2600130	318	A	0.51661	So let's refold this diagram so that we've taken the external time back out of it.
2601300	2609712	319	A	0.98	And we have this picture where the two components of Alice are just interacting via their shared boundary with their environment.
2609776	2617190	320	A	0.99907	Bob and now we can see that the source of redundancy is not time, it's the boundary itself.
2619320	2634940	321	A	0.99998	Just sharing the boundary allows Alice's components, a one and a two, to put copies of the same information on different places on the boundary.
2635520	2640510	322	A	0.99831	So the boundary now becomes a resource for redundant storage of information.
2641360	2666740	323	A	0.99623	So Alice one and Alice two can use different parts of the boundary to check what other parts of the boundary, say, to check the information that's encoded on other parts of the boundary so they can define an error correct encode on the boundary itself using this lock protocol.
2669320	2710710	324	A	0.99425	So I just want to leave you with this idea that using classical and quantum channels together allows us to define error correcting codes on boundaries that we share as separate agents and leave you to think about what shared measurements, what shared quantum reference frames let us as agents see the same things.
2713560	2718580	325	A	1.0	And this is what we'll talk about next time in September.
2719400	2741980	326	A	0.98668	We'll talk specifically about how space provides us with an error correcting code and try to understand why space is treated as emergent from something else, basically from communication in most of quantum gravity.
2742400	2744270	327	A	0.99689	So thank you very much.
2744880	2752716	328	A	1.0	I encourage you to use the interactive QA and to attend the discussion sessions, and we'll see you in September.
2752908	2753890	329	A	0.99987	Thank you.
2757940	2758690	330	B	0.99967	Awesome.
2760120	2763780	331	B	0.77182	Chris, thank you for the lecture.
2764280	2768950	332	B	0.73	Andrew, do you have any remarks or questions?
2770040	2771750	333	C	0.99618	Not right now, thank you.
2773320	2778116	334	B	0.99834	I'll just ask a few quick questions and if anyone has one, quickly in the live chat.
2778228	2789224	335	B	0.99984	So you mentioned the tick of the clock, and in active inference, we often hold up side by side both the discrete time models and the continuous time models.
2789272	2796460	336	B	0.96488	So do clocks have to tick discreetly or how do we think about continuous time modeling.
2799700	2801036	337	A	0.94178	In this quantum setting?
2801068	2816100	338	A	0.99998	They do have to tick discreetly because one has to be able to distinguish Alice's preparation of the qubits on her boundary from Bob's measurements of the qubits on the boundary.
2817640	2827130	339	A	0.91	And this process can be extremely fast with respect to any kind of sense of macroscopic time.
2829260	2836060	340	A	1.0	Your eyes are responding to photons in, I think it's hundreds of femtoseconds.
2837440	2853760	341	A	0.9997	So the discrete transitions that are effectively time measurements for you are at that very fast molecular timescale, much, much faster than our typical clocks.
2855300	2865860	342	A	1.0	Now, when we try to do very fast timing, we're constructing a faster clock than that, but it's a clock that we can only observe indirectly.
2870640	2871292	343	B	0.99999	Awesome.
2871426	2871916	344	B	0.99873	Okay.
2872018	2892390	345	B	1.0	Now this one maybe connects a little bit to application, but with all the developments happening in theory, some of which you're reviewing here and also in practice with quantum computation, and then keeping in mind this distinction sorry, I've lost you back.
2897440	2898936	346	A	0.99711	I've lost you, Daniel.
2899048	2901388	347	B	0.55189	Okay, we'll wait till you're back.
2901554	2902460	348	B	0.8	I can see you.
2902530	2902908	349	A	0.52339	No.
2902994	2903724	350	A	0.73172	Okay.
2903922	2904364	351	A	0.94	All right.
2904402	2905340	352	A	0.99514	Just repeat.
2906560	2906972	353	B	0.52	Yeah.
2907026	2937210	354	B	0.77886	So so given these rapid and ongoing developments in theory and practice related to quantum information science and quantum information security, how are people using this distinction of the classical stigmagic memory and then the quantum cognitive process to anticipate how to develop information systems that are reliable going forward?
2941520	2954880	355	A	0.75	I don't know of any instances in which thinking about quantum cognition has entered directly into any design of communication systems.
2955940	2961360	356	A	1.0	The ability of humans to interact with these systems is just assumed.
2962500	2976928	357	A	0.99888	So it's just assumed that the user can interact with, say, a computer interface, which is the sort of interface that will be provided or is provided to any quantum computer.
2977114	2985770	358	A	0.9996	So if you think about a quantum computer, a practical quantum computer, it has classical interfaces front and back.
2986700	2999196	359	A	0.9999	So in thinking about interacting with the computer, I'm giving it some classical problem statement, for example, and asking for some classical answer.
2999298	3003520	360	A	1.0	And what it's going to give me is a probability distribution of classical answers.
3004500	3011520	361	A	0.99945	But I can, by running the calculation many times, make that probability distribution fairly tight.
3016130	3020340	362	A	0.8	Yeah, I don't know of anyone talking about quantum BCIs at this point.
3021110	3022900	363	A	0.60839	It'd be an interesting question.
3027030	3036450	364	B	0.91	Was it always understood these sorts of blind spots and axioms associated with classical communication.
3037190	3046826	365	B	0.9	Was it developed as kind of like a proposal or like a special case and more unpacking was left for later?
3046928	3050730	366	B	0.9993	Or are these blind spots things that we're now coming into awareness of?
3050800	3054170	367	B	0.99998	Given what we're learning in the quantum information sciences?
3055890	3058560	368	A	1.0	I think we're learning how serious they are.
3059970	3064720	369	A	1.0	But they were certainly recognized even by Bohr in his 1928 paper.
3065490	3070050	370	A	1.0	And that's a very good paper, too.
3070200	3074194	371	A	0.9196	It's called the present state of quantum theory or something like that.
3074232	3079410	372	A	1.0	And it's in Nature, and it's available on the web somewhere.
3081050	3082760	373	A	0.99	I have a copy of it.
3083610	3098010	374	A	0.54298	But it was written, in a sense, as Bohr's summary of the 1927 Solve Conference, which was the conference at which everyone doing quantum theory at that time got together to talk about their results.
3098990	3116566	375	A	0.99	And in it, Bohr essentially presents what came to be the Copenhagen interpretation, which I think is probably unfairly called an interpretation.
3116698	3122850	376	A	0.49157	It's sort of the Copenhagen Pragmatic stance toward quantum theory.
3123670	3137320	377	A	0.98	And essentially what Bohr says is that if we're going to do science, we have to assume that people can talk to each other.
3138650	3152010	378	A	1.0	And if we're going to do science, we have to assume that there are instruments that we can manipulate and have reasonable confidence that we know what manipulation we've done.
3152080	3161200	379	A	0.99999	So if I turn a knob from one to two, I have to be reasonably confident that I'm making a particular change that I can understand.
3162690	3171170	380	A	1.0	And we have to have reasonable confidence that different laboratories can replicate the same experiment.
3172390	3181560	381	A	1.0	And if we think about any of those assumptions in purely quantum theoretic terms, then all sorts of questions are raised, right?
3182010	3184178	382	A	0.99999	Every quantum system is unique.
3184354	3188870	383	A	0.98725	We have the no Cloning theorem, so every scientific instrument is unique.
3189690	3194934	384	A	0.9986	So there's no such thing as exactly replicating an experiment.
3195062	3195740	385	A	0.99631	Right?
3196350	3202460	386	A	0.90797	That's a coarse grained description of what I've done with a completely unique quantum system.
3202990	3207646	387	A	1.0	And my brain, of course, is unique, and yours is too.
3207668	3209360	388	A	1.0	And everyone else's is.
3210050	3217070	389	A	0.98106	So talking about us sharing a language is essentially a coarse grained assumption.
3217910	3225710	390	A	0.91	And what the Copenhagen stance is all about is coarse graining yielding effective classicality?
3225870	3234840	391	A	0.9955	Or what that really means is coarse graining yielding a description that we can use in the language that we understand?
3235770	3252250	392	A	0.99998	So these are very, very old issues that have been recognized for a long time, but I think in part because of the disaster of shut up and calculate, they haven't really been talked about in the classroom.
3254990	3255546	393	B	0.98576	Awesome.
3255648	3258270	394	B	0.94641	I'll just read short questions from the chat.
3258930	3264190	395	B	0.99953	We can pass them to the discussion section, but there's a lot of great diverse questions.
3264340	3267680	396	A	0.99304	So Alexi wrote, I think I've lost you again.
3268470	3270318	397	A	0.9	The revenge of zoom.
3270494	3277570	398	B	0.985	Well, we looked at the chart earlier where, like, Bob was talking to Alice, the Unidirectional.
3280550	3281570	399	B	0.49632	Okay, okay.
3281720	3282978	400	B	0.93	The Unidirectional.
3283074	3285640	401	B	1.0	The third party is recording it, I'm sure.
3286410	3298038	402	B	0.42719	Alexi wrote, regarding the environment being used for error correction, a symptom of derealization in psychological trauma breakdown.
3298214	3301690	403	B	0.99987	We don't recognize the environment around us and it's scary.
3304350	3305340	404	A	0.9679	Makes sense.
3305810	3306750	405	B	0.9411	Makes sense.
3306900	3307566	406	A	0.98	All right.
3307668	3308778	407	B	0.55675	From Bala.
3308874	3309802	408	B	0.99995	Nice presentation.
3309866	3315994	409	B	1.0	I heard Chris say entangled states are LOCC for a specific reference frame.
3316122	3321730	410	B	0.99994	Is this entanglement unitary or is it related to the numbers of degrees of freedom?
3327320	3331270	411	A	1.0	I think the quick answer would be both.
3332940	3339720	412	A	0.81236	If you have a complex system with many degrees of freedom, some can be entangled while others aren't.
3341500	3345500	413	A	0.56	It depends on what parts of the state are separable.
3347040	3357500	414	A	0.99991	So again, entanglement is just a statement about components of a joint state that factor or don't.
3359700	3368000	415	A	0.99994	So you can have a joint state that looks separable along some dimensions, but in other dimensions.
3368580	3377190	416	A	1.0	The other big complication here is that whether a state looks entangled depends on the reference frames that you use to measure it with.
3378920	3388896	417	A	0.75	And if you pick entangled reference frames, then what we ordinarily think of as separable, as entangled states become separable.
3389088	3391270	418	A	0.5468	So you can move entanglement around.
3393800	3394524	419	B	0.99996	Awesome.
3394682	3411360	420	B	0.65934	Okay, from Roland Rodriguez is the discrete temporality only within the context of a given holographic screen interface with time being bracketed otherwise beyond interface systems, is continuity or discretion kept agnostic?
3414900	3419650	421	A	0.76	I think if I understand the question correctly, it's yes.
3420840	3434280	422	A	0.53066	If I don't draw any boundaries, I just have the joint state, then the evolution is unitary and in a sense time plays no role.
3434940	3443720	423	A	0.98	And if unitary evolution is perfectly time symmetric, so time actually drops out altogether.
3445840	3446204	424	A	0.54733	Awesome.
3446242	3448780	425	A	0.62995	So to talk about time, we have to draw boundaries.
3449280	3449740	426	B	0.9997	Awesome.
3449810	3452620	427	B	0.71469	Time must have a stop huxley.
3453040	3466604	428	B	0.97	And I'll ask one last question from the appropriately monikered question quanderer all communication is abductive is a sentiment that I've been using to develop some arguments.
3466652	3468210	429	B	0.9998	Does that scan for you?
3469560	3474260	430	B	0.99106	How do we connect what we're discussing here with quantum to abductive logic?
3477640	3482792	431	A	0.96	Yeah, I could go along with that.
3482846	3484330	432	A	0.7856	I'd want a lot more detail.
3486860	3490564	433	A	1.0	All communication is essentially analogical.
3490692	3491752	434	A	1.0	I would agree with that.
3491806	3492410	435	A	0.65832	Yes.
3493900	3494840	436	B	0.99	Andrew?
3497440	3497852	437	C	0.99882	Yes.
3497906	3498670	438	C	0.99995	Thank you.
3499280	3503500	439	C	0.99932	So going back to the picture where the scattering picture?
3504320	3512716	440	C	0.99641	So we have so far everything is topological and certainly induces breaking the boundary in different sectors.
3512748	3516396	441	C	1.0	I suppose it induces a topology on the boundary.
3516588	3521590	442	C	0.73	Now, I had a couple of questions as for the geometry, and this might be getting ahead.
3524200	3529104	443	C	0.99998	Is it an emergent property of those channels between different boundary sectors?
3529232	3533850	444	C	1.0	And if that's the case, then what does it mean to have a QRF or space?
3537660	3548750	445	A	0.99	Yeah, this is really the topic for September, but you do point out the fact that it's something of a chicken and egg situation.
3551040	3570980	446	A	1.0	The way I think of it is, I suppose to choose the chicken side and think about what kind of reference frame does the agent have to implement to see space on their boundary.
3572040	3576468	447	A	1.0	And the reason I think about it that way is that's a question?
3576554	3579360	448	A	1.0	I want to be able to ask about biological systems.
3579520	3584760	449	A	1.0	And this actually gets into probably what won't be talked about till October.
3585420	3610560	450	A	0.97849	But I want to be able to ask essentially a phylogenetic question of what sorts of organisms, where in the lineage from Luca do we find systems that are able to assign spatial coordinates to their boundaries and what coordinates come first?
3610710	3647630	451	A	1.0	And I suspect that sort of discrete location names with no metric come first that a system can talk about, for example, this part of their membrane versus that part of their membrane without even having any ability to say, how far apart they are and that some sort of metric representation of this angular space comes later and that a radial space comes even later than that.
3648080	3649928	452	A	0.92532	That's, at this point, speculation.
3650024	3662400	453	A	0.99999	But I think these are questions that we can end up asking given the right kind of formalism and the right understanding of what it means to be able to make a spatial measurement.
3663220	3670452	454	C	0.99998	So the conjecture is that the metric would emerge from a discrete network metric of counting ticks sort of thing.
3670506	3673236	455	A	0.72	Yeah, I think that's correct.
3673338	3682396	456	A	0.99	And the sort of symmetries of space that we see are very much tied up with object identity.
3682528	3696080	457	A	0.9906	So if we think about something like rotational symmetry let's see, I should stop screen sharing.
3698680	3707300	458	A	0.9999	So I've got this object, right, and I can do this, and I say, oh, space has this rotational symmetry.
3708040	3712744	459	A	0.99998	But for me to say that, I have to recognize that this is the same object, right?
3712862	3720010	460	A	0.96	I have to implement object persistence, which we all learn to do when we're nine months old or something.
3720880	3742480	461	A	0.99986	But we tend to regard those as separate things as we learn object persistence, because space is rotationally symmetric, but we can view it the other way around, that space is rotationally symmetric for me because I implement these constraints that are called object persistence.
3745060	3761240	462	B	0.99991	Do you think we can understand phylogenetics as a whole, as a kind of scattering experiment, like the high energy Leuka event and then dissipating and propagating in a very tangled bank?
3762780	3773388	463	A	0.99593	Well, I do want to be able to understand phylogeny in exactly the same terms as embryology, and Mike Levin and I have published papers about that.
3773474	3782030	464	A	0.99991	We should be able to view the lineage of Luca in exactly the same way that we view the lineage of the Zygote that produced us.
3783220	3795330	465	C	0.99803	So that's why it's no coincidence that during pregnancy, the development of the embryo mirrors evolution in terms of the parts that are developed first.
3796840	3810810	466	A	1.0	Yeah, this is the old idea that phylogeny and ontogeny are related in some way, which, from an embryonic development point of view, they're certainly analogous in ways.
3813340	3819700	467	C	0.99038	Sorry, if I may ask one last question, things should be very quick regarding the weak rotation.
3819780	3828590	468	C	0.99997	I'm still a bit unsure how it ties to this diagrammatic notation that we had with quantum channels on show so on.
3831760	3840240	469	C	0.94923	In the second session, we briefly talked about the weak rotation being a reversal in the direction of time.
3840310	3842960	470	C	0.99999	Is there any relation to today's session?
3845880	3862388	471	A	0.99	Yeah, whenever we think about the flow of time as driven by the input output cycle the input output cycle?
3862484	3869064	472	A	0.99979	For agents separated by a boundary, there's always a sign change.
3869182	3869560	473	A	0.77189	Right.
3869630	3872460	474	A	1.0	My input is your output, and vice versa.
3873200	3899540	475	A	0.96764	So when we think about the bob's clock ticking, when Alice does something, his direction of time, in a sense, points with respect to the boundary opposite to hers, but that's only with respect to the boundary.
3900600	3905270	476	A	0.99966	He sees information flowing in, and she sees information flowing in.
3907160	3912980	477	A	0.99979	That's the only point being made here about the WIC rotation as an operation.
3914600	3915590	478	C	0.94282	Thank you.
3916600	3917940	479	B	0.99967	Thank you, Chris.
3918520	3922668	480	B	0.99937	Very well appreciated by the viewers and by us.
