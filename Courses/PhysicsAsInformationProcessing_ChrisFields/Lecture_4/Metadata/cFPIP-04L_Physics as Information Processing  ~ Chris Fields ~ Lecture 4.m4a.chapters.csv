4230	35540	00:04	This is physics. As information processing session four on communicating observers. Fasten your seatbelts because we have a lot to cover in the next hour.	This is information processing session four on communicating observers	Quantum physics
36870	233970	00:36	We've been talking about quantum information theory in the simplest possible setting. Two systems exchange information through their mutual boundary. Free energy principle says that interacting systems will behave in a way that aligns their reference frames. One reason for studying quantum information to learn more about the FEP.	We've been talking about quantum information theory in previous sessions	Quantum information theory, the FEP
236390	458780	03:56	We're going to talk about agents that can be compartmentalized into multiple subagents that share an environment. All communication between agents uses degrees of freedom of the environment. We're talking about all of life here as well as all of social systems and ecosystems.	We want to talk about how multiple agents communicate about some shared environment	Multiple agents in a social system
460270	1088610	07:40	We can always represent a quantum reference frame as a topological quantum field theory. Once the reference frames are perfectly aligned, they jointly implement one quantum process. So that's what we're going to do for studying communication today.	Alice: We can transform quantum reference frames to form topological quantum field theories	Quantum entanglement and the topological field theory
1093050	1268590	18:13	We always assume with complete a plumb that agents can communicate classically. But it's not a straightforward assumption and it's worth any of you are looking at for interesting research projects can look into the nature of classical communication. It's full of hidden assumptions and surprises.	Classical communication involves assumptions and pitfalls, so be careful when discussing it	The nature of classical communication
1269890	1428440	21:09	The notion of entanglement was first noticed by Einstein, Podolski and Rosen in 1935. Schrodinger replied the same year with a very detailed paper. Nearly 50 years later entangler was first observed in the laboratory. Resource is the key to quantum secured communication.	Einstein, Podolski and Rosen first noticed entanglement in 1935	The history of entanglement
1429450	1719250	23:49	Entangled simply means not separable. So a state is entangled if and only if it does not factor into two separable states. This state propagates outward to two observers who have independent laboratories. This process requires classical communication.	Entangled simply means not separable	Quantum entanglement, the science
1720470	2181734	28:40	Chris: We can also represent a scattering experiment as a lock protocol. Lock means local operations and classical communication. To understand this transition from in to out, we have to integrate over all possible paths that are consistent with conservation of spin.	Lock means local operations and classical communication	Bell EPR as a lock protocol
2181852	2470180	36:21	Two parallel memories. A classical memory and a quantum channel. Whenever we have two memories in parallel, we can construct an error correcting code. This using something about the environment to check memory is absolutely ubiquitous.	Whenever we have two memories in parallel, we can construct an error correcting code	Quantum error-correcting code
2473180	2778116	41:13	Using classical and quantum channels together allows us to define error correcting codes on boundaries that we share as separate agents. Next time in September we'll talk specifically about how space provides us with an error correcting code.	Using classical and quantum channels together allows redundant storage of information	Quantum security at the ICU
2778228	2906972	46:18	In active inference, we often hold up side by side both the discrete time models and the continuous time models. Do clocks have to tick discreetly or how do we think about continuous time modeling in this quantum setting?	So do clocks have to tick discreetly or how do we think about continuous time modeling	Inactive Inference 6, The tick of the clock
2907026	3306750	48:27	I don't know of any instances in which thinking about quantum cognition has entered directly into any design of communication systems. The ability of humans to interact with these systems is just assumed. Was it always understood these sorts of blind spots and axioms associated with classical communication?	Given rapid developments in quantum information science and quantum information security, questions arise	Quantum cognition in the information sciences
3306900	3394524	55:06	Is this entanglement unitary or is it related to the numbers of degrees of freedom? It depends on what parts of the state are separable. Whether a state looks entangled depends on the reference frames that you use to measure it with.	Whether a state looks entangled depends on the reference frames that you use	Entanglement and Separation in the Computer
3394682	3452620	56:34	Is discrete temporality only within a given holographic screen interface? Is continuity or discretion kept agnostic? To talk about time, we have to draw boundaries. Time must have a stop huxley.	Roland Rodriguez: To talk about time, we have to draw boundaries	Given the discrete temporality of the holographic screen
3453040	3498670	57:33	All communication is essentially analogical. How do we connect what we're discussing here with quantum to abductive logic? I'd want a lot more detail.	All communication is essentially analogical, Andrew says	All Communication is Abductive
3499280	3810810	58:19	Is it an emergent property of channels between different boundary sectors? And if that's the case, then what does it mean to have a QRF or space? Do you think we can understand phylogenetics as a whole, as a kind of scattering experiment?	Question: What does it mean to have a QRF or space	Phylogeny and the law of topology
3813340	3940680	1:03:33	Sorry, if I may ask one last question, things should be very quick regarding the weak rotation. I'm still a bit unsure how it ties to this diagrammatic notation. Everybody is welcome and encouraged to join for the participatory discussion in about two weeks on Saturday.	Sorry, if I may ask one last question regarding the weak rotation	The Weak Rotation
