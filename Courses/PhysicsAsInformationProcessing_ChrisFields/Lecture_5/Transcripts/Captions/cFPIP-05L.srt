00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,348
Hello and welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:15,624
It is September 14th, 2023, and we are in the course: Physics as information processing.

3
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:17,150
It's lecture 5.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,904
Looking forward to this lecture and then a little conversation.

5
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:21,884
Chris, off to you.

6
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:22,670
Thank you.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,596
Okay.

8
00:00:25,778 --> 00:00:27,100
Thank you, Daniel.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,340
And, welcome to session 5 of Physics of information processing.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:46,680
And, today we're going to talk about Spacetime, and particularly about the idea that Spacetime is emergent from information processing.

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,940
And, this has now become a very mainstream idea in the quantum information and quantum gravity communities.

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:05,580
And there are still, of course, some people holding out for the idea that Spacetime is fundamental.

13
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:33,000
But I would say that, at least in these communities, I expect it's become now the dominant idea that Spacetime is not fundamental, that Spacetime is not part of the basic ontology of reality or something like that, and that instead, Spacetime is a construct.

14
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,570
So, that's what today's Session is going to be about.

15
00:01:39,740 --> 00:02:03,360
So, for those of you who are just joining or who would like a little review, we started this course talking about Quantum Information Theory and the idea that Quantum Information Theory is actually a new science about systems that communicate across a boundary.

16
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:17,632
And, the systems are always called Alice and Bob for kind of historical reasons. And, we emphasized that this new science is topological.

17
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:20,752
It's about connectivity between systems.

18
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:22,596
It's not geometric.

19
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:26,436
So, it doesn't assume a Spacetime embedding.

20
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:32,100
So, it leaves open the possibility that Spacetime is actually a construct.

21
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,150
It doesn't assume Spacetime up front.

22
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:59,824
And, in the 2nd Session of the course, I think, we talked about how this boundary could always be represented as an array of qubits, and that what the systems on each side of the boundary do to communicate is prepare and then measure the states of these qubits.

23
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:11,440
So, they communicate by exchanging classical information via a quantum channel.

24
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:26,630
And, this introduces a particular kind of quantum noise whenever they don't share the reference frames that they use to prepare the bits and measure the bits.

25
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:37,646
So, it's not necessarily a perfect communication channel from a classical fidelity point of view, but all of the noise is quantum noise.

26
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:45,100
It's not classical, and it always derives from differences in the reference frames that are used by the two agents.

27
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:56,480
We reformulated the Free Energy Principle in this setting, and the Free Energy Principle turned out to be very simple.

28
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:05,170
It turns out to be a classical limit of the Principle of Unitarity, which is just the principle that information is conserved.

29
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:18,290
And, we saw that the approach to perfect alignment between the two agents, or perfect prediction on the part of the two agents, becomes more challenging.

30
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,590
Not surprisingly, as system complexity increases.

31
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:29,180
So, the more complex the communication, the harder it is to predict, as one would expect.

32
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:42,240
In the last Session, we talked about how constraints on thermodynamic free energy induce compartmentalization in agents.

33
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:59,810
So, whenever agents interact with their environments in fairly complex ways, then they end up being compartmentalized into compartments that have to communicate classically.

34
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,986
And, this is solely a result of Quantum Information Theory.

35
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:14,562
You don't have to assume any biology to get this compartmentalization, but clearly, this is something that we see in biological systems.

36
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:30,250
Not only do we see compartments, we also see hierarchical control, which is likewise a sort of automatic outcome of the theory for complex systems.

37
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:49,620
And finally, last time, we talked a little bit about how these compartments communicate and introduced the idea of communication protocols that involve local operations on a shared quantum resource of some kind and classical communication.

38
00:05:52,014 --> 00:06:06,754
We talked to fair amount about how classical communication is a little bit problematic to define in Quantum Theory, because, of course, you're introducing classicality.

39
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:12,730
And so, you have to make some very specific assumptions about what's classical.

40
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:26,270
And, we'll see later on today what the key assumption that gives you classicality is, as we talk about Spacetime.

41
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:35,220
But before I go into the topic of Spacetime, I want to spend a little time.

42
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,300
Okay, sorry.

43
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,962
This is where we're going.

44
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:46,360
We're talking about Spacetime, and we'll talk about applications to biology next time.

45
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:53,030
But before we get going on this, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about the explanation.

46
00:06:53,930 --> 00:07:07,100
And, this is motivated by a question that came up, a very long question that touched on many different topics that came up in the interactive Q&A last time.

47
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:30,450
And, a fair amount of that question had to do with, directly or indirectly, the question of what scale-free explanation looks like and how it compares to scientific explanation in general, most of which is reductive.

48
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:49,514
So, I want to make a short detour into the question of how reductionist theories, which all of you are probably very familiar with, relate to scale-free theories, and particularly the Free Energy Principle is a scale-free theory.

49
00:07:53,070 --> 00:08:04,240
So, it's a theory that's unlike most of the theories that most of you probably learned about in college.

50
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:20,994
So, we're all familiar with reductionist theories and the reductionist idea of scientific explanation, which is really an outcome of the Philosophy of Science in the 1920s and 1930s.

51
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:30,280
People like Rudolph Carnap were among the first to actually make precise what this idea of reductive explanation is.

52
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:51,920
But the basic idea is that the laws or the dynamics or the formalism that describes the behavior at some microscale, the behavior of little things actually explains the behavior of big things.

53
00:08:52,610 --> 00:09:01,680
So, the basic reductionist idea is that what the little things are doing is what's important.

54
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:11,422
And, what big things are doing are either emergent phenomena, or they're just epiphenomena.

55
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:13,890
They're essentially just appearances.

56
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,898
And, this defines a fundamental scale.

57
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:34,998
So, the real assumption in any reductionist theory is that there's some fundamental scale at which the "real dynamics" takes place and everything else is just an appearance, or it's some sort of emergent phenomenon.

58
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:44,874
And, I try to be very careful when I use the word "emergence" because it's one of the most ambiguous words in the Philosophy of Science.

59
00:09:44,922 --> 00:09:47,680
And people use it to mean all sorts of different things.

60
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:59,380
But whenever you say "emergent", it always sort of implies the idea that it's emergent from something.

61
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:17,350
And, so the idea of emergence is essentially a reductionist idea because it at least implicitly assumes that there's some microscale from which the macroscale is emergent.

62
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:30,460
And so, the discussions of emergent phenomena are often very consistent with reductionism, even if they claim not to be.

63
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:38,670
And, we're all taught that science is reductionist.

64
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,930
And, there are certainly people who publicly claim that science is reductionist.

65
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,340
Richard Dawkins is certainly a shining example of this.

66
00:10:51,430 --> 00:11:19,740
But I suspect that a lot of scientists just kind of play lip service to reductionism without really believing in it, because they don't really believe that the macroscopic phenomena that they are studying, life, for example, is completely determined by what's going on at the microscale, or what's going on at the microscale, plus some stochastic noise or something like that.

67
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:26,910
So, I want to explicitly contrast this with a scale-free theory.

68
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:36,050
In a scale-free theory is not simply a holistic theory, it's much more precise.

69
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:49,590
In a scale-free theory, little things and big things obey the same laws, or they have the same dynamics, or they're described by the same formalism.

70
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:55,110
So it's not that the macro scale is emergent from the microscale.

71
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,410
The macro scale and the microscale actually obey the same laws.

72
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:10,250
And, the relationship between macro and micro is probably best stated as one of implementation.

73
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:20,480
Macro scale things have microscale components, and those microscale components are doing something or other.

74
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:29,410
And, whatever they're doing implements the macroscale system and its behavior.

75
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:41,960
But this implementation is not an explanation, or at least it's not an explanation all by itself.

76
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,866
And the bumper sticker version of scale-free theories is just as above, so below. Whatever laws you have at the macro scale, are the ones, the same ones you have at the microscale, and vice versa.

77
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:57,498
So, scale-free theories, in a sense, are simple.

78
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:01,470
It's the same theory at every level of description.

79
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:11,520
So, what is this idea of scale, and how does it relate to what we've talked about in this course?

80
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:19,090
Well, what we've talked about in this course all has to do with what an agent can observe on its boundary.

81
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:30,360
So, scale has to do with how information is encoded on the boundary, and we can describe that scale in many different ways.

82
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:41,340
Here's a commonplace way to describe it in Physics by a relationship between energy and distance, or size.

83
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:48,250
And, you've probably all heard of the Planck scale.

84
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,840
The Planck scale is the smallest scale at which current Physics makes any sense.

85
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:07,650
And, in energetic terms, it's defined by energies on the order of 10 to the 19th GEV, which is gigaelectronvolt.

86
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:18,738
The LHC (the Large Hadron Collider) in Switzerland gets to about 10 to the 4th GEV.

87
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:23,190
So many, many orders of magnitude less than the Planck scale.

88
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:30,170
So the Planck scale is extremely energetic compared to what we can probe experimentally.

89
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:44,110
The Planck scale energy of 10 to the 9th GEV corresponds to a distance of about 10 to the -35 meters, which is incredibly tiny.

90
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,970
An intermediate scale on this diagram is about the scale of a nucleon.

91
00:14:51,050 --> 00:15:01,410
So, for example, a proton or a neutron, they have a rest mass of about 1 GEV and a size of about 1 femtometer.

92
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,550
So, this intermediate scale is roughly the scale of nucleon Physics.

93
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:27,066
And, then if you go to our scale, the scale of things that are about a meter in size, human beings, tables, and chairs, lots of animals, the things we're most familiar with, that corresponds to an incredibly tiny energy 10 to the -5 electron volts, which is about the energy of a photon of radio... radiation. And, a meter is about the wavelength of long wave Radio.

94
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:51,966
So, if you think about visible light, it has a wavelength of about 10 to the -5 meters, an energy of about an electron volt.

95
00:15:52,078 --> 00:16:07,670
So, it's not surprising that visible light feels energetic to us because it's orders of magnitude above our natural scale of energy of this sort of thermal environment in which we exist.

96
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:24,640
So, it's the encoding scale and the boundary that is going to relate theories of things that we see to each other.

97
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,874
And, this ends up giving a kind of complicated picture.

98
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:34,770
If you think of Alice interacting with Bob and measuring things on the boundary...

99
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,790
Sorry, I'm a little bit ahead of myself.

100
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,954
I just wanted to show you a picture of a Reductive Theory.

101
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:45,994
This is the Big Bang.

102
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,700
You're all familiar with this.

103
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:57,220
Something happens at the Planck scale, and the entire universe results from it by just a scale change.

104
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,626
So this is a Reductive Theory.

105
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:03,830
A scale-free theory is much more complicated.

106
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,720
So here's what a scale-free theory looks like.

107
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:17,962
Alice interacts with Bob, and she's looking at her boundary, and her boundary states, the boundary states she sees could be encoded at different scales.

108
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:28,080
So, there may be a small-scale scale1 and a bigger scale scale2.

109
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:39,200
And, what Alice is looking for is some sort of theory that relates the first scale, the microscale, to the macro scale.

110
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:49,540
So, it's not that the microscale came first like it did in the Big Bang, and the macro scale came later.

111
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,430
These are encodings that can be happening simultaneously.

112
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:03,494
And the theoretical task is to find theories that relate between these scales.

113
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:11,020
And these are implementation theories, or you might call them embedding theories from one scale into another.

114
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:19,982
And what we want as a consistency criterion is for these theories to be constant in time.

115
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:22,400
So as Bob evolves in time and what Alice sees are these encodings on her boundary.

116
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:37,220
She wants the relationship between encodings at different scales to stay constant, because if it doesn't, she'll never be able to figure anything out.

117
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:45,960
She'll just have this chaotic relationship between things happening at different scales, and nothing will make sense.

118
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,130
So, you have this complicated picture in scale-free theories.

119
00:18:53,470 --> 00:19:14,510
And, if you look at this and it seems vaguely familiar, or even vaguely... even very familiar then it should, because this is exactly the kind of explanatory structure or semantic structure that you have in Computer Science.

120
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:30,390
If you're studying the behavior of a computer, which is just some piece of hardware, some physical system, then you can describe what that piece of hardware is doing at different scales.

121
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:47,878
And, in fact, what we call "the hardware level of description" when we talk about our laptops, for example, is typically the level of description of circuits and transistors inside microprocessors.

122
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:50,010
We think of that as "the hardware level".

123
00:19:50,160 --> 00:20:08,020
But of course, that's just a description, too, that's layered on top of lots of much smaller scale dynamics, all the way down to the scale of atoms and eventually nuclei and elementary particles and all that other stuff.

124
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:17,250
So, there's some quantum stuff that's going on that we describe as having a classical hardware level of bit exchange.

125
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,320
And then, we describe the behavior of programs on top of that.

126
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:40,134
So, what we want, what makes a computer useful is that we can assign semantics to programs, and we can talk about semantic relationships between programs.

127
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:58,900
For example, the relationship between the internet protocol stuff that Zoom is doing and what you actually see on your user interface and hear on your user interface. That needs to stay fixed over time or Zoom becomes incomprehensible and not programmable and, in fact, not even well defined as an algorithmic system.

128
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:17,080
And, the same is true for the relationship between the operating system and the hardware description, or between the operating system and Zoom as a program.

129
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:24,666
So, Computer Science works in exactly this scale-free way.

130
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:31,462
And so, in a sense, the scale-free explanation is very familiar.

131
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:36,618
It's exactly the kind of explanation that we have in Computer Science.

132
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:50,850
And, that's why I referred to the relationship between scales as one of implementation because that's a term that we're familiar with from thinking about computers implementing programs.

133
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,046
So, what are these theories?

134
00:21:54,238 --> 00:22:19,210
If we think in biological terms, we can think of pathways being embedded in a cell, or cells being embedded in tissues, all the way up to niches of various kinds, which may be social niches being embedded in ecosystems, and ecosystems being embedded in the biosphere.

135
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:28,670
And so, we have all of these essentially semantic theories that talk about how one scale embeds in another scale.

136
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:56,310
And, if we have these sorts of scale transitions, we can think of representing the relationship between transitions at different scales in terms of the activity of some kind of renormalization group, which is transforming entities and processes at one scale into entities and processes at another scale.

137
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:23,470
And I think in Biology, we can at least put forward the hypothesis that in all the way from pathways embedding in cells to ecosystems embedding in the biosphere, we could put forward the hypothesis, at least, that the renormalization group flow across all of these scales is trivial.

138
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:48,146
That is that the embedding theories all have the same formal structure, that the structure that describes how pathways embed into cells is the same structure that describes how ecosystems embed into the biosphere.

139
00:23:48,338 --> 00:23:51,080
Now, I certainly can't prove that.

140
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,650
I believe that it's likely.

141
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,370
So, I think it's an interesting hypothesis to investigate.

142
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:10,240
And, this is a hypothesis that I want to leave you with as a result of this class is something to think about.

143
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:21,940
To what extent, in thinking about biological systems or even social systems, are the embedding theories the same?

144
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:56,378
So, in thinking this way, that the physics of the situation has the same formal structure as Computer Science has in terms of explanation, we're of course, faced with a problem, which is that we're not just reconstructing physics, we're talking about the physics of interacting observers.

145
00:24:56,474 --> 00:24:58,830
We're talking about the physics of communication.

146
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,710
So, we're modeling how we do physics.

147
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,970
And, that makes our theory self-referential.

148
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:21,320
And so, we have to face the music from Gödel's theorem, which tells us essentially that powerful self-referential theories can't be both consistent and complete.

149
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:26,690
And, by powerful I just mean powerful enough to express arithmetic, so, not terribly powerful.

150
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:35,100
So, this becomes an issue that we have to live with.

151
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:54,478
We will always be faced with this issue of having to construct meta-theories which tell us how our lower-level theories work, but we never get to the end of that process.

152
00:25:54,644 --> 00:26:06,820
We never can get to theories that are both consistent and complete, because our tower of theories becomes progressively, actually more powerful as it goes up.

153
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:30,860
So Gödel, in a sense, poses a problem, but in another sense just tells us what life is like as a scientist, that you can't have everything all the time doing science, but we probably all already knew that.

154
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:53,700
So, let's now talk about space, end of digression, and see how these ideas apply to a system or a tower of systems that can construct a spatial embedding in its world, in its observed world.

155
00:26:54,390 --> 00:27:06,760
So, let's start out thinking about a system that can see its environment, but what it sees is a completely uniform environment where nothing is happening.

156
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:19,180
So, if you have a uniform environment where nothing is happening, you can't distinguish one part of the environment from another.

157
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,860
You have no sense of space.

158
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:42,402
So, what I want to do is build up from scratch what's needed to have a sense of space, and then we'll talk a little bit about what organisms are doing.

159
00:27:42,456 --> 00:28:05,820
And I think a very interesting question is, if you look at phylogeny, at what points in phylogeny, what lineages in phylogeny actually need to have a sense of space, and what do they have to have in terms of computational power to have that sense of space?

160
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:12,140
So, if you just have a uniform environment, you don't have a sense of space.

161
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:25,550
But the first thing we can do with an environment is to divide it up into some number of parts that are somehow distinguishable.

162
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,810
So suppose we can segment the environment into two different parts.

163
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,066
And if you think about E.Coli, for example, E.Coli has a bunch of sensors on the front and a bunch of effectors on the back. So, it can sense much more about the front part of the environment than the back part of the environment.

164
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,206
So, already with E.Coli, you have this kind of segmentation of the environment into parts, but so far, nothing is happening in this environment.

165
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:04,090
We just have segments that can be distinguished.

166
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:14,670
So, let's consider an environment like this, that has distinguishable segments.

167
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:24,020
What one next wants to know about these segments is whether they're next to each other.

168
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:38,040
And, if we just have a bunch of segments, we just have a set, and a set doesn't have any order or any relationship information.

169
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:48,570
So, I've drawn this environment as a rectangle of rectangles, but that's just a representation.

170
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:58,830
And, it looks like there are relationships between these rectangles, but if they're just a set, then there are no relationships.

171
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,790
If we want to add relationships, then we have to add them explicitly.

172
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:34,250
So, let's add some connections between these different segments of the environment to turn that set into a graph that says explicitly, for example, that the light green segment is attached to the light blue segment, and it's also attached to the dark green segment, and the dark blue segment is attached to the light blue segment and attached to the dark green segment.

173
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:39,722
So, now we have something that's much more mathematically complicated than a set.

174
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:42,842
We have a graph that has some connection information.

175
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:45,070
So, we have a connection topology.

176
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,110
Now, adding this topology does something very important.

177
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:55,870
It breaks the exchange symmetry that is there if you just have a set.

178
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:11,110
So if we just have a set, it doesn't make any difference if I exchange, for example, the positions of the upper right light blue segment with the upper left light green segment.

179
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:16,120
But if we have this connection topology, then it does make a difference.

180
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:28,330
Right, I've twisted the graph around, and if I have to break connections to exchange things, then I've actually changed the topology.

181
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:40,990
So, adding a topology, adding connections, can disrupt a symmetry that's there if there is no topology.

182
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:50,100
So, now let's think about, now we have the structure that's required to think about something happening.

183
00:31:51,430 --> 00:32:03,974
So, suppose that at some time, as measured in the bit counter time reference frame of the observing system, something happens.

184
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:07,190
So, a dot appears in the light green segment.

185
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:13,814
And, we can express this actually in the notation of quantum field theory.

186
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:27,200
We can think of the light green segment as a field and the dot appearing is the occurrence of an excitation in that field.

187
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:39,570
And so, we can write this notation that says that the green field was excited to produce a dot which is up arrow green dot.

188
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:56,040
And, sometime after that it may turn out that the dot disappears in the green field and some sort of dot appears down in the dark blue field.

189
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:05,450
And again, we can write this in this kind of creation and destruction operator notation that one has in quantum field theory.

190
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:14,090
And so, this says that the green field is no longer excited, but now the dark blue field is excited.

191
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:20,270
So, this doesn't imply anything about these excitations being the same.

192
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,320
In fact, they're completely different.

193
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:27,860
One is an excitation of the green field and one is an excitation of the blue field.

194
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,650
But at least now something is happening in the environment.

195
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:42,882
So, we can think about what does it take for an observer to notice that something is happening in its environment?

196
00:33:42,946 --> 00:34:02,890
It has to be able to detect a change occurring in some segment of its environment, and that change can involve something happening or something stopping happening in that segment of its environment.

197
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:09,680
But it doesn't yet have to have any idea of what an object is.

198
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:31,310
But we can add that if the system has a memory, we can have the system connect these events happening in different parts of its environment.

199
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:42,610
So, if the system has a memory that has some number of steps, I'll say n steps, but here it could even just be 2 steps.

200
00:34:44,890 --> 00:35:03,526
It can see transitions between these two different states, where there's a dot in the green field and then a dot in the dark blue field, and then a dot in the green field, and then a dot in the dark blue field, and then a dot in the green field, etc.

201
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:12,080
So, I've expressed this in this sort of field theory notation over on the right side.

202
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,418
And, what this is is a flip-flop.

203
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:18,430
It's an observed periodic behavior.

204
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:24,610
So, this is the basic idea behind a clock.

205
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:38,914
So, any observer that can see this number of time steps internally can interpret what's going on in its external environment as a clock ticking.

206
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,910
It can see some periodicity.

207
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:55,782
So, as long as you can have memory and the ability to detect change, you can see periodic behavior in the environment.

208
00:35:55,926 --> 00:35:59,470
So, you can see the environment acting like a clock.

209
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:08,110
So, let's think a bit about what this does and does not require.

210
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:17,802
So, seeing a clock in the environment requires having distinguishable, non-exchangeable sectors of the environment.

211
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:23,390
So, you have to have this connection topology that breaks the exchange symmetry.

212
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:29,154
It requires having these sectors implement some sort of flip-flop.

213
00:36:29,282 --> 00:36:42,890
So, something periodic happening, and you have to have enough memory to see that periodicity, but it doesn't require any sense of object identity.

214
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:53,600
So, the excitation in the green part and the excitation in the blue part can still just be field excitations of the green part and the blue part.

215
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,742
There's nothing that says that those have to be the same thing.

216
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:03,860
They just have to appear and disappear in some periodic way.

217
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,580
And, having a clock doesn't require a metric space.

218
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,730
You don't need to have any sense of distance defined by the environment.

219
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:19,750
You just have to have this segmentation that is not rearrangeable.

220
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:27,340
So, this tells us something extremely important, which is that time is more fundamental than space.

221
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:36,570
Time in the exterior environment is much simpler and easier to observe than space in the exterior environment.

222
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:54,130
So, if we're thinking biologically about phylogeny, we might expect to see organisms that can detect periodic behavior in the external environment long before they can detect spatial organization in the exterior environment.

223
00:37:54,470 --> 00:38:02,530
And, we know that organisms, even down to microbial mats, can respond to the diurnal cycle.

224
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:22,540
So, we know that organisms, in a sense, can detect environmental clocks, even organisms that we have no reason to believe, divide the environment up into spaces or the sort of space that we're used to, like a Euclidean space.

225
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:30,590
So, adding space to this idea of time in the environment.

226
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:53,890
So, the next step is to be able to see motion. And, being able to see one thing move from one segment of the environment to another segment, as opposed to something happening in one segment, and then something happening in another segment.

227
00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:11,338
One has to have this idea of object persistence, that there's a thing that has an identity, and its identity doesn't change over time, and it doesn't change when you move it someplace else.

228
00:39:11,424 --> 00:39:16,460
When it appears someplace else in the environment, it's the same object.

229
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:30,190
So, this is an idea that psychologists call "object persistence", and it's an idea that physicists call "translational invariance".

230
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:35,314
Translational invariance means two things.

231
00:39:35,512 --> 00:39:42,098
It means that if I have an object and I move it to a different location, I don't change the object.

232
00:39:42,264 --> 00:39:46,166
It's the same object that I move from here to there.

233
00:39:46,348 --> 00:39:49,080
So, the location doesn't change the object.

234
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,854
And, it also means the reverse of that.

235
00:39:53,052 --> 00:39:56,310
It means that the object doesn't change the location.

236
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:04,730
My container remains invariant even though I move the object around in it.

237
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:12,990
So these are kind of the two phases of translational invariance, and they're the two faces of object persistence.

238
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:24,100
As the object moves through time, its identity remains fixed, and it doesn't change the time that it's moving through.

239
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:32,610
So, if I'm measuring its motion with a clock, moving the object doesn't change the clock.

240
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,590
These are clearly very classical ideas.

241
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,750
And, we talked about earlier classical communication.

242
00:40:45,450 --> 00:41:08,880
And, when we talked about classical communication in, for example, the context of a Bell EPR experiment, we talked about the observers being able to write down some data on a piece of paper or on a disk drive or something and hand those data to someone else.

243
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,774
So, this is translational invariance.

244
00:41:11,822 --> 00:41:16,130
The data can't change when Alice gives it to Bob.

245
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:20,020
Otherwise, there isn't classical communication taking place.

246
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:25,494
And of course, there's an up to noise built into here, right?

247
00:41:25,532 --> 00:41:31,654
The piece of paper might get wet and the ink might run a little bit, but it's still the same message.

248
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:35,430
There's still some identity being assumed.

249
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:41,670
So, object persistence is not an idea we get from Quantum Theory.

250
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,850
It's an idea that we impose on top of Quantum Theory.

251
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:50,190
And, it's this idea that's intrinsically classical.

252
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:56,170
So, we're looking right here at the quantum to classical transition.

253
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,360
This is it.

254
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,334
This is what gets added to Quantum Theory to get classical physics.

255
00:42:02,382 --> 00:42:04,850
It's this idea of object persistence.

256
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:19,560
Now, once we have object persistence, we can kind of go to town constructing space, and here's how we do it.

257
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:45,440
We all learned about object persistence this way when we were six months old, doing motor babbling and observing our hands and feeling how our bodies worked and seeing objects that we could manipulate and that didn't change when we manipulated them.

258
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,658
So, this is the birth of object persistence.

259
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:55,330
This is the birth of classicality in human psychology.

260
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:02,546
So, now let's start thinking about building a coordinate system.

261
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:03,842
What's a coordinate system?

262
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:09,990
A coordinate system is just a set of labels that are attached to these segments of the environment.

263
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,120
And, to build a coordinate system, you have to have an origin.

264
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:22,060
And, an origin means an object, something that's fixed, something that doesn't move around.

265
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:29,510
And, so a coordinate system requires the ability to identify a stigmergic memory. It requires the ability to find something in the environment that has a meaning that stays constant over time.

266
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,474
And, that's what a stigmergic memory is.

267
00:43:45,512 --> 00:43:53,380
It's something in the environment that provides us with a memory resource that we can count on being the same.

268
00:43:54,650 --> 00:44:25,280
And, it's having this fixed point that allows us to label these connected segments of the environment that contain objects that move and be able to say, okay, the object moved from this part of the environment to another part. And, I can give those parts labels with respect to this other part that doesn't move, this origin point.

269
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:30,910
And, once I have this, I can construct other invariances.

270
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:43,170
So, for example, I can consider an object that rotates around this origin without changing its identity. And that defines what's called rotational invariance.

271
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:58,006
And, I can also talk about an object that gets bigger and smaller compared to this fixed point and that defines radial distance.

272
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:24,340
And, if you think about the baby in the previous slide that's doing motor babbling, it sees things getting smaller as it moves them farther away. So, the visual system does this computation for us and constructs this radial coordinate for us with respect to our bodies, or specifically our heads, our eyes.

273
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:44,390
So, in doing this very early motor activity, we're actually building the spatial coordinate system for our brains that's implemented by the hippocampus, the place cells in the hippocampus.

274
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:58,780
And, if I have an origin point in the environment, I can also infer that I am moving, that I have changed my location with respect to that object.

275
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:11,162
And, that's a considerably more complicated inference because you have to have a representation of the self of you to say "I moved".

276
00:46:11,306 --> 00:46:16,562
So, this is something that comes after you've developed this spatial coordinate system.

277
00:46:16,696 --> 00:46:25,400
You have to be able to locate, in a sense, metacognitively, a particular object that's you in that coordinate system.

278
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:33,638
So, we're going to set that aside and now talk about adding some numbers, so, adding a metric. And, adding a metric requires another particular kind of object, which is a ruler, a particular fixed object that can be moved around and that has translational invariance, and rotational invariance up to some transformation, up to some tensor.

279
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:05,410
And, in Euclidean space, that tensor is the identity.

280
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:12,530
So, in Euclidean space, you have perfect translational and rotational invariance.

281
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:24,120
As you get into general relativity, then the ruler can actually change its length as you rotate, or the ruler can change its length as it moves through space.

282
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:35,530
So effectively, your spacetime can deform, the coordinates of your spacetime can deform, and that gives you the representation of mass, of course, in general relativity.

283
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:48,030
So, we talked several sessions ago about quantum reference frames, and I used the example of rulers and clocks as quantum reference frames.

284
00:47:48,530 --> 00:48:07,110
So, now we see how to construct those from observations and symmetry breaking and object identity, all of which we need to define a quantum reference frame out in the environment, like a ruler.

285
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:18,678
And, notice that we don't need any of that environmental stuff to define those QRFs within our own processing.

286
00:48:18,774 --> 00:48:27,194
And in fact, the ones that exist within us, we have no direct access to.

287
00:48:27,392 --> 00:48:39,280
We can look at someone else's brain and talk about their spatial representation system, but we can't look inside our own brains and talk about our spatial representation system.

288
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:46,820
So, this is how we get a metric space from the ground up.

289
00:48:47,990 --> 00:49:10,620
And, we've talked about this from a very psychological or biological point of view: starting from sort of motor capabilities, motor babbling, for example, a measure of effort which gives you some sense of mass.

290
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:17,130
So, if it's easy to move something, it's light, and if it's hard to move something, it's heavy.

291
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:26,510
And, we understand that when we're six months old because we can measure how much force we're having to apply with our muscles.

292
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:42,370
We have a reference internally for this force that we're applying, and we use that internal measurement to attribute this idea of mass to things in the environment.

293
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:45,490
We have to have memory from manipulations.

294
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:53,830
We have to be able to identify invariances that define object persistence.

295
00:49:54,330 --> 00:50:01,580
And we have to be able to build a ruler that we can move around and use to define a metric space.

296
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:06,460
Now, this is very different from the way physicists approach this.

297
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:12,942
If you look at the physics literature, people start with information transfer.

298
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:17,470
They talk about entanglement as a basic resource.

299
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:23,822
There's a lot of discussion of bulkboundary duality.

300
00:50:23,886 --> 00:50:40,178
And, the most well-known one is the duality between anti-de Sitter space, which is the sort of space you see inside a black hole, and conformal field theory, a quantum field theory on the boundary of the black hole.

301
00:50:40,274 --> 00:50:50,330
So, how things you can see, for example, going on, on the horizon of a black hole are dual to the geometry and the interior by this mathematical relationship. You can use that mathematical relationship to construct quantum error-correcting code by using the symmetries of the field theory as a resource for redundancy that allows you to represent the same thing in different places.

302
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:21,090
And, as soon as you can do that, you can build up a network of elements that look basically like elements of a lattice.

303
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:32,840
And, a lattice is a graph to which you can assign symmetric relationships, and you get a metric space.

304
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:46,730
And in physics, typically, the goal is to get Einstein's equations out of this to start with some information-theoretic sorts of constructs and get the equations of general relativity.

305
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:51,534
But what are the equations of general relativity?

306
00:51:51,572 --> 00:52:13,330
These are things that Einstein derived by doing fairly simple thought experiments, using the invariances of ordinary Euclidean space, combined with ideas from special relativity about the speed of light being constant.

307
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:31,980
And, he added the Principle of Equivalence, which is the idea that essentially mass and acceleration are the same thing, or that gravity and acceleration are the same, that weight and acceleration are the same thing.

308
00:52:33,230 --> 00:53:01,890
So, it's at least reasonable to expect that this inferential process that's going on in theoretical physics is generating the same thing, although in a very formalized way that we can generate by thinking about how organisms deal with their environments.

309
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:09,800
And so, I want to leave this with you as the second hypothesis here.

310
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:21,610
The first one was the hypothesis about a trivial renormalization group flow across scales and biology.

311
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:31,920
The second hypothesis is that these two approaches to emergent spacetime are actually giving us the same information.

312
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:50,450
And, maybe starting out with the same information, in fact, that we may be able to think about these fundamental building blocks of information flow and entanglement in terms of the sorts of perceptual relationships that we've been talking about in this class.

313
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:06,520
So there's our second hypothesis to think about going forward.

314
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:27,390
And I just want to leave you with the idea that organisms at least manage this very interesting process that we can think of starting with the construct of memory.

315
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:39,730
Organisms have memory at multiple scales, and it's memory that allows them to formulate the idea that there are objects.

316
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:47,670
And, as soon as you have objects that persist, you have a source of redundancy.

317
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,550
So, you can do error correction.

318
00:54:51,610 --> 00:55:03,690
And, if you can do error correction, if you can move the same thing from one place to another and have it encode the same information, then you can build spacetime.

319
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:10,810
And, as soon as you have spacetime, you can use the spacetime as more memory.

320
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:15,514
You can use the spacetime itself, as the error correcting code because spacetime has the nice ability to hold lots of copies of some informative structures.

321
00:55:25,466 --> 00:55:37,058
So, you can build libraries, or you can build computers, or you can build the internet, if you have spacetime, which gives you more memory, which gives you more object persistence, which gives you more error correction.

322
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:39,494
And, the circle just spins around.

323
00:55:39,692 --> 00:55:44,950
So, organisms do this, and the question is, how does it get off the ground?

324
00:55:45,610 --> 00:56:04,830
And, next time, we can at least speculate about that kind of origin of life type of question in the context of the FEP and its realization in simple systems of communicating observers.

325
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:12,080
So, as always, I encourage you to use the interactive Q&A.

326
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:27,000
The 5th discussion session with Ander, who's unfortunately not here today, will be the last day of September, Saturday 5:00, as usual, European time, California time.

327
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:32,150
And then, the last session of the class will be the 12th of October.

328
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:39,100
So, thank you very much, and I look forward to your questions in the interactive Q&A.

329
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:45,740
Awesome.

330
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:49,838
Thank you, Chris.

331
00:56:50,014 --> 00:56:51,700
Can I ask some short questions?

332
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,250
Sure.

333
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,238
All right.

334
00:56:54,424 --> 00:57:04,200
So, first Lana wrote: is the periodicity, the time lengths between and during the excitations built in?

335
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:11,340
So this was when we had the four cells and there were the inklings of a clock coming into play.

336
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:39,930
I think the simplest answer is that if nothing else is happening in the environment except this periodic behavior, then it's not actually meaningful to talk yet about the time between the events.

337
00:57:49,680 --> 00:58:18,000
So, if I have a system that's quasiperiodic, for example, and nothing else is going on in my environment, then I can't distinguish that from a perfectly periodic system because I would have to have a perfectly periodic reference to know that the other system was aperiodic.

338
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:36,360
And, if you think about the internal clock being driven by information flow into the system, then something has to be happening in the environment for information to be flowing into the system and being counted.

339
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:47,550
So, again, as we talked about a few sessions ago, the internal memory only gets updated when something happens.

340
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,250
So, internal and external get tied together.

341
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:10,500
This is why we can use external clocks, but it's also why we depend on external clocks because our intuitive sense of time is very malleable.

342
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:24,570
And so, we actually, as humans, use external clocks to correct for the malleability of our own intuitive sense of time.

343
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,396
Wow.

344
00:59:27,518 --> 00:59:47,760
And there's probably a lot to be said for that procrustean nature of having the chronometer, the clock on the wall, and the tick, tick, tick as an evolutionarily novel ruler of time, playing a logistical role in time bound society.

345
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:56,292
Yeah, think of earlier clocks that earlier cultures have used and that animals use.

346
00:59:56,346 --> 01:00:08,136
I mean, we have the solar clock, the lunar clock, etc., and the orbit of Venus clock that was so important to the Mayans and so on.

347
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:19,740
So there are lots of available clocks in the environment if you have the ability to notice them and enough memory to realize that they're clocks.

348
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,140
Awesome.

349
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:25,192
All right, here's a question from Upcycle Club.

350
01:00:25,256 --> 01:00:35,040
1: They wrote: how does representing the network structure and dynamics with quantum embeddings affect the semantic interpretation of the network?

351
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:48,970
The embedding theory is the simplest semantic interpretation of the network.

352
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:51,420
So...

353
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:05,980
1: And again, a good way to think of this is through the lens of Computer Science.

354
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:20,240
As soon as you have a programming language that allows variable binding, then you've built a very simple kind of semantics into the language.

355
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:45,000
1: If you have X as a variable and you have variable binding, then at different times in the execution of the program, X can have different causal consequences for downstream computation because it's been bound to a different value, so it has different semantics.

356
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:53,500
1: So, the semantics of X, again, go back to Gregory Bateson.

357
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:03,420
1: The basis of semantics is differences that make a difference, make a difference to behavior, make a difference to actionability.

358
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:12,610
So, variable binding gives you differences that actually make a difference to what the program does.

359
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:18,310
So, what is that?

360
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:32,440
That is the semantics that's assigned by your embedding theory between what the programming language is doing and what the operating system is doing and so forth.

361
01:02:33,500 --> 01:03:02,800
And, I think it's no surprise that the semantics of programming languages end up being represented with these very general mathematical constructs like Category Theory, which are essentially tools for representing arbitrary relations between systems.

362
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:06,370
1: And, that's what embedding theories are.

363
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:12,740
They're theories that state relationships between systems.

364
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:34,660
Awesome, and very provocative to explore on the biological and life and on the spacetime and matter sides, which are of course, seamlessly integrated through, if only our own experiences.

365
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:44,992
Yeah, this is another place where it's useful to go back to this difference between reductive theories and scale-free theories.

366
01:03:45,136 --> 01:03:53,476
Scale-free theories are all about semantics because they represent the existence of stuff happening at different scales.

367
01:03:53,508 --> 01:04:01,820
And so, they naturally raise the question of what are these relationships, what are these embedding theories?

368
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:09,550
And, in reductive theories there's a very deep sense in which semantics doesn't matter.

369
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:26,530
1: If you think that all that's going on that's important is the stuff that's going on at the Planck scale, then you don't need any semantics, right?

370
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:47,284
1: You see this in the late 60s, early 70s, old-fashioned AI, where people talk about computation, is purely syntactic.

371
01:04:47,412 --> 01:04:49,972
1: And, this is a very reductionist view of computation.

372
01:04:50,036 --> 01:04:56,300
It leaves out the semantics, and without the semantics, the computation is useless.

373
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,350
It doesn't tell us anything at all unless we can map it to something.

374
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:21,190
So, we have this philosophy of science tradition that tells us that semantics is not important, and we end up with tools like the FEP that essentially tell us that semantics is all important.

375
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:31,976
1: And, from a biological point of view, the most natural response is, of course, we knew that all the time.

376
01:05:32,078 --> 01:05:33,720
That's why we're doing biology.

377
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,630
1: So all of this ties together.

378
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:49,068
Would you say that FEP says semantics is important, and then what does it say about what semantics are important?

379
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:52,560
Or is that entirely left up to the modeler?

380
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:03,480
Well, it tells you a lot about what's important for the system itself, right?

381
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:12,830
The system itself is dealing with its environment and it's trying to increase its predictive power.

382
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:21,904
So, it's building a theory of the environment, and that theory is intrinsically semantic, right?

383
01:06:21,942 --> 01:06:26,800
It's about the environment and it's actionable.

384
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:47,210
The theory is meant to drive action on the environment that will either yield more information or get the environment to behave, to do what I'm predicting it's going to do.

385
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:58,060
1: So, I think the FEP is intrinsically semantic in that sense, that it's about an agent modeling its environment.

386
01:06:59,040 --> 01:06:59,596
Yes.

387
01:06:59,698 --> 01:07:27,492
And about the semantics of action, as opposed to a partial or limited semantics of passive inference or semantics of abstraction, which kind of leaves the important link between the agent and the environment through sense-making and decision selection basically unaddressed because it's kind of Descartes in the thought experiment in the room.

388
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:31,830
And here, when we actually engage with the boundary of the room, that's where we start.

389
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,120
Yeah, yeah.

390
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:45,700
1: The FEP completely destroys this classical notion of the passive observer, as does Quantum Theory.

391
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:48,680
There are no passive observers in quantum theory.

392
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:58,040
So, this is a construct that we inherited from a classical worldview that is seriously misleading.

393
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:07,986
A lot more to say, but that's a great place to end.

394
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:09,170
Thank you, Chris.

395
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:10,498
OK.

396
01:08:10,584 --> 01:08:11,566
Thank you, Daniel.

397
01:08:11,678 --> 01:08:12,914
And thanks to you all.

398
01:08:13,032 --> 01:08:14,740
1: And ask questions.

399
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:15,874
See you next time.

400
01:08:15,912 --> 01:08:16,222
Cheers.

401
01:08:16,286 --> 01:08:17,040
We'll see you next time.
