1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,356
You. Hello and

2
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:09,976
welcome, everyone. It is September 14,

3
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:13,580
2023, and we are in the course,

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,104
physics as information processing. It's

5
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:19,084
lecture five. Looking forward to this

6
00:00:19,122 --> 00:00:20,904
lecture and then a little conversation.

7
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:22,670
Chris, off to you. Thank you.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,100
Okay. Thank you, Daniel.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,116
And welcome to to session five of

10
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:33,860
Physics of information processing. And

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,044
today we're going to talk about

12
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:36,020
Spacetime,

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,424
and particularly about the

14
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:44,856
idea that Spacetime is emergent from

15
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:48,952
information processing. And this has now

16
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:52,056
become a very mainstream idea in the

17
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,096
quantum information and quantum gravity

18
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:57,976
communities. And there's

19
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:01,692
still, of course, some people

20
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:04,152
holding out for the idea that Spacetime

21
00:01:04,216 --> 00:01:07,680
is fundamental. But I would say that,

22
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,560
at least in these communities,

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,868
I expect it's become now the dominant

24
00:01:15,964 --> 00:01:19,940
idea that Spacetime is not fundamental,

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,150
that Spacetime is not part of

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,604
the basic ontology of reality or

27
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:31,124
something like that, and that instead,

28
00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:35,364
Spacetime is a construct. So that's

29
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:37,848
what today's session is going to be

30
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:41,224
about. So for those

31
00:01:41,262 --> 00:01:44,716
of you who are just joining or who

32
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:47,980
would like a little review, we started

33
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,344
this course talking about quantum

34
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:54,684
information theory and the

35
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:57,232
idea that quantum information theory is

36
00:01:57,286 --> 00:02:00,476
actually a new science about systems

37
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:03,360
that communicate across a boundary.

38
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,236
And the systems are always called Alice

39
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:10,660
and Bob for kind of historical reasons,

40
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,470
and emphasize that this

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,228
new science is topological. It's about

42
00:02:18,314 --> 00:02:21,392
connectivity between systems. It's not

43
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:24,744
geometric. So it doesn't assume a

44
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:27,832
Spacetime embedding. So it leaves open

45
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:30,824
the possibility that Spacetime is

46
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:33,300
actually a construct. It doesn't assume

47
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,150
Spacetime up front.

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,708
And in the second

49
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:43,340
session of the course, I think we talked

50
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,592
about how this boundary could always be

51
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:50,064
represented as an array of qubits, and

52
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:53,136
that what the systems on each side of

53
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:56,384
the boundary do to communicate is

54
00:02:56,582 --> 00:02:59,076
prepare and then measure the states of

55
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:01,748
these qubits. So they communicate by

56
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:07,850
exchanging classical

57
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,440
information via a quantum channel.

58
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,874
And this introduces a particular kind

59
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:18,622
of quantum noise whenever they don't

60
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:22,180
share the reference frames that they use

61
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,894
to prepare the bits and measure the

62
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:29,890
bits. So it's not necessarily

63
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,342
a perfect communication channel from a

64
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:34,550
classicality fidelity point of view,

65
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,646
but all of the noise is quantum noise.

66
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:40,410
It's not classical, and it always

67
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,506
derives from differences in the

68
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:44,266
reference frames that are used by the

69
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:48,054
two agents. We reformulated

70
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:51,022
the free energy principle in this

71
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:54,714
setting, and the free energy principle

72
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:57,786
turns out to be very simple. It turns

73
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:00,318
out to be a classical limit of the

74
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,206
principle of unitarity, which is just

75
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:04,082
the principle that information is

76
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:07,614
conserved. And we saw that the approach

77
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:11,202
to perfect alignment between

78
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:14,766
the two agents, or perfect prediction

79
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:17,394
on the part of the two agents, becomes

80
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:19,574
more challenging. Not surprisingly, as

81
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:22,886
system complexity increases. So the

82
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:25,846
more complex the communication, the

83
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:28,554
harder it is to predict, as one would

84
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:32,214
expect. In the last session,

85
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:35,654
we talked about how constraints

86
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:39,762
on thermodynamic free energy induce

87
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:42,240
compartmentalization in agents.

88
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,274
So whenever agents interact

89
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:50,362
with their environments in fairly

90
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:54,530
complex ways, then they

91
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,882
end up being compartmentalized into

92
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:58,910
compartments that have to communicate

93
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,494
classically. And this is solely

94
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:04,986
a result of quantum information theory.

95
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,214
You don't have to assume any biology to

96
00:05:08,252 --> 00:05:11,110
get this compartmentalization, but

97
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,014
clearly, this is something that we see

98
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:15,414
in biological systems. Not only do we

99
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:18,522
see compartments, we also see

100
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:22,330
hierarchical control, which is likewise

101
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,380
a sort of automatic outcome of

102
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,250
the theory for complex systems.

103
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,598
And finally, last time, we talked a

104
00:05:33,604 --> 00:05:37,082
little bit about how these compartments

105
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:40,414
communicate and introduce the

106
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:44,002
idea of communication protocols that

107
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:47,454
involve local operations on a shared

108
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:50,450
quantum resource of some kind. And

109
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,626
classical communication. We talked to

110
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:55,442
Fairman about how classicality

111
00:05:55,506 --> 00:05:58,374
communication is a little bit

112
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:03,026
problematic to define

113
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:04,774
in quantum theory, because, of course,

114
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:07,174
you're introducing classicality. And so

115
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:09,066
you have to make some very specific

116
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,730
assumptions about what's classical.

117
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,802
And we'll see later on today what

118
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,670
the key assumption that gives you

119
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,800
classicality is,

120
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,270
as we talk about Spacetime.

121
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,546
But before I go into the topic

122
00:06:31,578 --> 00:06:34,562
of Spacetime, I want to spend a little

123
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:37,860
time. Okay,

124
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,278
sorry. This is where we're going. We're

125
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:43,634
talking about Spacetime, and we'll talk

126
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:46,360
about applications to biology next time.

127
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,814
But before we get going on this, I want

128
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:51,462
to spend a little bit of time talking

129
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:56,230
about explanation. And this is motivated

130
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,682
by a question that came up, a very long

131
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:02,842
question that touched on many different

132
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:05,770
topics that came up in the interactive Q

133
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,100
A last time.

134
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,430
And a fair amount of that

135
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,614
question had to do with, directly or

136
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:19,006
indirectly, the question of what

137
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:23,090
scale free explanation looks like and

138
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,310
how it compares to scientific

139
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,506
explanation in general, most of which is

140
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:32,626
reductive. So I

141
00:07:32,648 --> 00:07:36,198
want to make a short detour into

142
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:39,890
the question of how reductionist

143
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,390
theories, which all of you are probably

144
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,622
very familiar with, relate to scale free

145
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:49,306
theories, and particularly the

146
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:50,874
free. Free, free energy principle.

147
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:54,566
Scale free theory. So it's

148
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:57,866
a theory that's unlike most of the

149
00:07:57,888 --> 00:08:01,246
theories that most of

150
00:08:01,268 --> 00:08:04,240
you probably learned about in college.

151
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,950
So we're all familiar with reductionist

152
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,618
theories and the reductionist idea of

153
00:08:12,644 --> 00:08:16,242
scientific explanation, which is really

154
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,834
an outcome of philosophy of science in

155
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:23,090
the. People like Rudolph Carnap

156
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,662
were among the first to actually make

157
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,722
precise what this idea of reductive

158
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:32,402
explanation is. But the basic

159
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:36,262
idea is that the

160
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:40,010
laws or the dynamics or the formalism

161
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,114
that describes behavior at some

162
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:45,482
microscale, the behavior of little

163
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:50,034
things actually explains

164
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:53,674
the behavior of big things. So the basic

165
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:57,854
reductionist idea is that what

166
00:08:57,892 --> 00:09:01,034
the little things are doing is what's

167
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,466
important. And what big things are

168
00:09:04,488 --> 00:09:09,134
doing are either emergent phenomena,

169
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:12,014
or they're just epiphenomena. They're

170
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:16,102
essentially just appearances. And this

171
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,654
defines a fundamental scale. So the

172
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,082
real assumption in any reductionist

173
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:24,434
theory is that there's some fundamental

174
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:27,882
scale at which the real dynamics takes

175
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:31,034
place and everything else is just an

176
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,242
appearance, or it's some sort of

177
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:37,754
emergent phenomenon. And I

178
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:39,626
try to be very careful when I use the

179
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:41,966
word emergence because it's one of the

180
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:44,266
most ambiguous words in the philosophy

181
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:46,014
of science. And people use it to mean

182
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,680
all sorts of different things.

183
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,990
But whenever you say emergent,

184
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,626
it always sort of implies the idea that

185
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:59,380
it's emergent from something.

186
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,490
And so the idea of emergence is

187
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,022
essentially a reductionist idea because

188
00:10:08,156 --> 00:10:10,726
it at least implicitly assumes that

189
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:14,406
there's some microscale from which

190
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:17,350
the macro scale is emergent.

191
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:24,006
And so discussions

192
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:26,362
of emergent phenomena are often very

193
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,634
consistent with reductionism, even if

194
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:33,946
they claim not to be. And we're

195
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:37,582
all taught that science is

196
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:40,190
reductionist. And there are certainly

197
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,694
people who publicly claim that science

198
00:10:43,742 --> 00:10:47,154
is reductionist. Richard Dawkins is

199
00:10:47,192 --> 00:10:50,340
certainly a shining example of this.

200
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,062
But I suspect that a lot of scientists

201
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:56,278
just kind of play lip service to

202
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,774
reductionism without really believing in

203
00:10:58,812 --> 00:11:01,558
it, because they don't really believe

204
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:04,262
that the macroscopic phenomena that they

205
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:06,840
are studying, life, for example,

206
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,874
is completely determined by what's going

207
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:12,330
on at the microscale,

208
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,622
or what's going on at the microscale,

209
00:11:15,686 --> 00:11:18,842
plus some stochastic noise or something

210
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:23,002
like that. So I want to explicitly

211
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:26,910
contrast this with a scalefree theory.

212
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,534
In a scale free theory is not

213
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:35,122
simply a holistic theory, it's much more

214
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:38,370
precise. In a scale free theory,

215
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,514
little things and big things obey the

216
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:45,350
same laws, or they have the same

217
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,022
dynamics, or they're described by the

218
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:51,494
same formalism. So it's not that

219
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:54,006
the macro scale is emergent from the

220
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:57,158
microscale. The macro scale and the

221
00:11:57,164 --> 00:12:00,410
microscale actually obey the same laws.

222
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,826
And the relationship between macro and

223
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:08,150
micro is probably best stated

224
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,250
as one of implementation.

225
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,922
Macro scale things have microscale

226
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:17,994
components, and those microscale

227
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:20,480
components are doing something or other.

228
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,830
And whatever they're doing implements

229
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,410
the macroscale system and its behavior.

230
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:37,886
But this implementation is

231
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:40,134
not an explanation, or at least it's not

232
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:43,286
an explanation all by itself. And the

233
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:45,142
bumper sticker version of scale free

234
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:47,558
theories is just as above. So below

235
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:49,278
whatever laws you have at the macro

236
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:51,978
scale, are the ones, the same ones you

237
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:54,646
have at The Microscale, and Vice Versa.

238
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:56,762
So, scale free Theories, in a sense,

239
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:59,530
are simple. It's the same Theory at

240
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,470
every level of Description.

241
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,750
So what is this idea of scale,

242
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,306
and how does it Relate to what we've

243
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:11,520
talked about in this Course?

244
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,514
Well, what we've talked about in this

245
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:16,930
Course all has to Do With what an Agent

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,006
Can Observe on its Boundary. So scale

247
00:13:21,118 --> 00:13:23,602
has to Do With How Information Is

248
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:25,330
Encoded on the boundary,

249
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,302
and we can Describe that scale in many

250
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:32,694
different Ways. Here's A

251
00:13:32,732 --> 00:13:34,486
Commonplace Way to Describe it in

252
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:38,074
Physics by A Relationship between

253
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,340
energy and distance, or size.

254
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,314
And you've probably

255
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:49,226
all heard of the Planck scale. The

256
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:51,454
Planck scale is the smallest scale at

257
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:53,840
which current Physics Makes any sense.

258
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,158
And in energetic terms,

259
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:03,026
it's defined by energies on the order of

260
00:14:03,048 --> 00:14:06,162
Ten to the 19th GEV, which is

261
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:10,926
GiGAelectron volt. The LHC,

262
00:14:11,038 --> 00:14:12,946
the Large Hadron Collider in

263
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:13,890
Switzerland,

264
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,430
gets to about ten to the Fourth GEV. So

265
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,926
many, many orders of magnitude less than

266
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:25,382
the Planck scale. So the Planck scale is

267
00:14:25,436 --> 00:14:28,314
extremely energetic compared to what we

268
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:32,374
can probe Experimentally. The Planck

269
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:35,130
scale energy of ten to the 9th GEV

270
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,714
corresponds to a distance of about ten

271
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,494
to the -35 meters, which is

272
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:46,922
incredibly tiny. An intermediate

273
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,914
scale on this diagram is about the scale

274
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:52,566
of a nucleon. So, for example, a proton

275
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:55,906
or a neutron, they have a rest mass of

276
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,922
about one GeV and a size of about

277
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:03,326
one femtometer. So this intermediate

278
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:05,714
scale is roughly the scale of nucleon

279
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:09,734
physics. And then if

280
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:12,502
you go to our scale, the scale of things

281
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:15,320
that are about a meter in size,

282
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,946
Human beings, Tables and chairs, lots of

283
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:23,174
animals, the Things we're most Familiar

284
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,070
with, that corresponds to an incredibly

285
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,834
tiny energy. Ten to the -5 EV is

286
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:32,590
about the energy of a photon of radio

287
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,814
Radiation, and a meter is about

288
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:41,230
the Wavelength of long wave Radio.

289
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,340
So if you think about Visible light,

290
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,234
has a Wavelength of about ten to the -5

291
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:51,262
meters, an energy of about an electron

292
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,002
volt. So it's not Surprising that

293
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:56,342
visible light feels energetic to Us

294
00:15:56,396 --> 00:15:59,538
because it's Orders of magnitude above

295
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:03,798
our Natural scale of energy of

296
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:06,374
this Sort of thermal environment in

297
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:12,406
which we exist. So it's

298
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:16,380
the encoding scale and the boundary that

299
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,102
is going to relate theories of things

300
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:24,640
that we see to each other.

301
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,694
And this ends up giving a kind of

302
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:29,694
complicated picture. If you think of

303
00:16:29,732 --> 00:16:33,162
Alice interacting with Bob and measuring

304
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,770
things on the boundary.

305
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,790
Sorry, I'm a little bit ahead of myself.

306
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,046
I just wanted to show you a picture of a

307
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:45,994
reductive theory. This is the Big Bang.

308
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,700
You're all familiar with this.

309
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,558
Something happens at the Planck scale,

310
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,860
and the entire universe results from it

311
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,220
by just a scale change.

312
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,626
So this is a reductive theory.

313
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:02,902
A scale free theory is much more

314
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:06,342
complicated. So here's what a scale free

315
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:07,720
theory looks like.

316
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,430
Alice interacts with Bob,

317
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,050
and she's looking at her boundary,

318
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,694
and her boundary states. The boundary

319
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:20,714
states she sees could be encoded at

320
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:24,154
different scales. So there may be

321
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:26,586
a small scale scale one and a bigger

322
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:30,782
scale scale two. And what

323
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:33,582
Alice is looking for is some sort of

324
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:37,242
theory that relates the first scale,

325
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:39,200
the microscale, to the.

326
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,250
So it's not that the microscale came

327
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,554
first like it did in the Big Bang, and

328
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,540
the macro scale came later.

329
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,606
These are encodings that can be

330
00:17:53,628 --> 00:17:56,726
happening simultaneously. And the

331
00:17:56,748 --> 00:18:01,330
theoretical task is to find theories

332
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,706
that relate between these scales. And

333
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:05,834
these are implementation theories, or

334
00:18:05,872 --> 00:18:08,410
you might call them embedding theories

335
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,020
from one scale into another.

336
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,578
And what we want as a consistency

337
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:18,894
criterion is for these theories to be

338
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,742
constant in time. So as Bob evolves in

339
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:25,566
time. And so what Alice sees are

340
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:28,274
these encodings on her boundary. She

341
00:18:28,312 --> 00:18:30,814
wants the relationship between encodings

342
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:33,438
at different scales to stay constant,

343
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,666
because if it doesn't, she'll never be

344
00:18:35,688 --> 00:18:37,220
able to figure anything out.

345
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,642
She'll just have this chaotic

346
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:42,854
relationship between things happening at

347
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:45,334
different scales, and nothing will make

348
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:49,014
sense. So you have

349
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:52,134
this complicated picture in scale

350
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:55,178
free theories. And if you look at this

351
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:58,342
and it seems vaguely familiar,

352
00:18:58,406 --> 00:19:01,610
or even vaguely even very familiar,

353
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,590
then it should, because this is

354
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,770
exactly the kind of explanatory

355
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,846
structure or semantic structure that you

356
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:16,870
have in computer science. If you're

357
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,170
studying the behavior of a computer,

358
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,950
which is just some piece of hardware,

359
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,394
some physical system, then you can

360
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:28,082
describe what that piece of hardware is

361
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:31,926
doing at different scales. And in

362
00:19:31,948 --> 00:19:34,614
fact, what we call the hardware level of

363
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:37,142
description when we talk about our

364
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:40,246
laptops, for example, is typically the

365
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:45,014
level of description of circuits,

366
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:47,878
of transistors inside microprocessors.

367
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:50,010
We think of that as the hardware level.

368
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,466
But of course, that's just a

369
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:53,674
description, too, that's layered on top

370
00:19:53,712 --> 00:19:58,026
of lots of much smaller scale dynamics,

371
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:02,480
all the way down to the scale of

372
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,454
atoms and eventually nuclei and

373
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:07,394
elementary particles and all that other

374
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:11,602
stuff. So there's some quantum stuff

375
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:13,922
that's going on that we describe as

376
00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:16,402
having a classical hardware level of bit

377
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:19,990
exchange. And then we describe

378
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,320
the behavior of programs on top of that.

379
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,134
So what we want, what makes a computer

380
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:32,230
useful is that we can assign

381
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,130
semantics to programs,

382
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,134
and we can talk about semantic

383
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:40,394
relationships between programs. For

384
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:44,470
example, the relationship between the

385
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,302
Internet protocol stuff that

386
00:20:48,356 --> 00:20:51,758
Zoom is doing and what you actually

387
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:54,366
see on your user interface and hear on

388
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:57,490
your user interface that needs to stay

389
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,974
fixed over time. Or Zoom becomes

390
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:03,982
incomprehensible and not programmable

391
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:06,786
and in fact, not even well defined as an

392
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,574
algorithmic system. And the same is true

393
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:11,126
for the relationship between the

394
00:21:11,148 --> 00:21:12,770
operating system and the hardware

395
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,770
description, or between the operating

396
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,080
system and zoom as a program.

397
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,538
So computer science works

398
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:25,866
in exactly this scale free way. And so,

399
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:30,182
in a sense, scale free explanation

400
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:33,706
is very familiar. It's exactly the kind

401
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:35,678
of explanation that we have in computer

402
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:38,414
science. And that's why I referred to

403
00:21:38,452 --> 00:21:40,734
the relationship between scales as one

404
00:21:40,772 --> 00:21:44,638
of implementation, because that's a

405
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:46,794
term that we're familiar with from

406
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:49,854
thinking about computers implementing

407
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:54,046
programs. So what are these theories?

408
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:57,140
If we think in biological terms,

409
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,954
we can think of pathways being embedded

410
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:05,826
in a cell, or cells being embedded

411
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:10,914
in tissues, all the way up to niches

412
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,210
of various Kinds, which may be social

413
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,246
niches being embedded in ecosystems,

414
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:18,186
and ecosystems being embedded in the

415
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,466
biosphere. And so we have all of these

416
00:22:21,568 --> 00:22:24,294
essentially semantic theories that talk

417
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:27,838
about how one scale embeds in another

418
00:22:27,924 --> 00:22:32,302
scale. And if we have these

419
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:35,294
sorts of scale transitions, we can think

420
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:38,180
of representing the relationship between

421
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,354
transitions at different scales in terms

422
00:22:42,392 --> 00:22:44,034
of the activity of some kind of

423
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:47,220
renormalization group, which is

424
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,906
transforming entities and processes

425
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:54,850
at one scale into entities and processes

426
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:58,406
at another scale. And I think in

427
00:22:58,428 --> 00:23:02,054
ontology, we can at least put

428
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:07,546
forward the hypothesis that all

429
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:11,206
the way from pathways embedding in cells

430
00:23:11,238 --> 00:23:13,146
to ecosystems embedding in the

431
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:16,046
biosphere, we could put forward the

432
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:17,982
hypothesis, at least, that the

433
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:21,486
renormalization group flow across all of

434
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:24,942
these scales is trivial. That is

435
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:27,906
that the embedding theories all have the

436
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:34,578
same formal structure, that the

437
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:38,382
structure that describes

438
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:41,942
how pathways embed into cells is the

439
00:23:41,996 --> 00:23:45,222
same structure that describes how

440
00:23:45,276 --> 00:23:48,146
ecosystems embed into the biosphere.

441
00:23:48,338 --> 00:23:51,080
Now, I certainly can't prove that.

442
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,234
I believe that it's likely. So I think

443
00:23:56,272 --> 00:23:58,314
it's an interesting hypothesis to

444
00:23:58,352 --> 00:24:02,922
investigate. And this is an

445
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:05,760
hypothesis that I want to leave you with

446
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,102
as a result of this class is something

447
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:13,146
to think about. To what extent,

448
00:24:13,338 --> 00:24:15,886
in thinking about biological systems or

449
00:24:15,908 --> 00:24:17,470
even social systems,

450
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,940
are the embedding theories the same?

451
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,580
So,

452
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:31,094
in thinking this way, that the

453
00:24:31,132 --> 00:24:34,646
physics of the situation has the

454
00:24:34,668 --> 00:24:37,878
same formal structure as computer

455
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:40,390
science has in terms of explanation,

456
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,940
we're of course, faced with a problem,

457
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,930
which is that we're not just

458
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,570
reconstructing physics,

459
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,942
we're talking about the physics of

460
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:56,894
interacting observers. We're talking

461
00:24:56,932 --> 00:25:00,320
about the physics of communication. So

462
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,710
we're modeling how we do physics.

463
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,074
And that makes our theory self

464
00:25:07,112 --> 00:25:11,922
referential. And so we have to face

465
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:15,090
the music from Goethel's theorem, which

466
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,762
tells us essentially that powerful self

467
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,830
referential theories can't be both

468
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,378
consistent and complete. And by powerful

469
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:25,842
I just mean powerful enough to express

470
00:25:25,906 --> 00:25:28,630
arithmetic. So not terribly powerful.

471
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:33,914
So this becomes an issue that we have

472
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,100
to live with.

473
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:43,100
We will always be faced with this issue

474
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,550
of having to construct meta theories

475
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,702
which tell us how our lower level

476
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:53,358
theories work, but we never get to the

477
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:56,574
end of that process. We never can get to

478
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:58,514
theories that are both consistent and

479
00:25:58,552 --> 00:26:01,870
complete, because our tower of theories

480
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,290
becomes progressively, actually more

481
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,820
powerful as it goes.

482
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,570
So Goethel,

483
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,806
in a sense, poses a problem, but in

484
00:26:14,828 --> 00:26:17,622
another sense just tells us what life is

485
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,350
like as a scientist,

486
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:25,146
that you can't have everything all

487
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:28,390
the time doing science,

488
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,860
but we probably all already knew that.

489
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,846
So let's now talk about space, end of

490
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:38,382
digression, and see

491
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:42,880
how these ideas apply to

492
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,202
a system or a tower of systems that

493
00:26:47,256 --> 00:26:51,314
can construct a spatial embedding in

494
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:54,802
its world, in its observed world. So

495
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:58,100
let's start out thinking about a system

496
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,134
that can see its environment, but what

497
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:04,450
it sees is a completely uniform

498
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,760
environment where nothing is happening.

499
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,314
So if you have a uniform environment

500
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:15,094
where nothing is happening, you can't

501
00:27:15,142 --> 00:27:17,062
distinguish one part of the environment

502
00:27:17,126 --> 00:27:19,180
from another from another.

503
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,860
You have no sense of space.

504
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:28,958
So what I want to do is build

505
00:27:29,044 --> 00:27:32,734
up from scratch what's needed

506
00:27:32,932 --> 00:27:34,960
to have a sense of space,

507
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,410
and then we'll talk a little bit about

508
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,106
what organisms are doing. And I think a

509
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,746
very interesting question is, if you

510
00:27:45,768 --> 00:27:49,422
look at phylogeny, at what points

511
00:27:49,496 --> 00:27:53,510
in phylogeny, what lineages in phylogeny

512
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,840
actually need to have a sense of space,

513
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:01,350
and what do they have to have

514
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,474
in terms of computational power to have

515
00:28:04,512 --> 00:28:08,026
that sense of space? So if you just have

516
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:11,098
a uniform environment, you don't have a

517
00:28:11,104 --> 00:28:15,742
sense of space. But the

518
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,134
first thing we can do with an

519
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:20,526
environment is to divide it

520
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:23,774
up into some number of parts that are

521
00:28:23,812 --> 00:28:27,694
somehow distinguishable. So suppose

522
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:30,594
we can segment the environment into two

523
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:33,746
different parts. And if you think about

524
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:36,786
E. Coli, for example, E.

525
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:39,202
Coli has a bunch of sensors on the front

526
00:28:39,256 --> 00:28:41,640
and a bunch of effectors on the back,

527
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:45,638
so it can sense much more about

528
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,526
the front part of the environment than

529
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:50,358
the back part of the environment. So

530
00:28:50,444 --> 00:28:52,714
already with E. Coli, you have this kind

531
00:28:52,752 --> 00:28:56,570
of segmentation of the environment into

532
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,946
parts, but so far, nothing is happening

533
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:01,802
in this environment. We just have

534
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:04,090
segments that can be distinguished.

535
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,690
So let's

536
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,574
consider an environment like this, that

537
00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:14,670
has distinguishable segments.

538
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,402
What one next wants to know about these

539
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:23,362
segments is whether they're next to each

540
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:26,514
other. And if we just have

541
00:29:26,552 --> 00:29:29,960
a bunch of segments, we just have a set,

542
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,680
and a set doesn't have any order

543
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,040
or any relationship information.

544
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:43,258
So I've drawn this environment as

545
00:29:43,424 --> 00:29:46,646
a rectangle of rectangles, but that's

546
00:29:46,758 --> 00:29:48,570
just a representation.

547
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,066
And it looks like there are

548
00:29:53,088 --> 00:29:55,194
relationships between these rectangles,

549
00:29:55,242 --> 00:29:57,326
but if they're just a set, then there

550
00:29:57,348 --> 00:30:00,462
are no relationships. If we want to add

551
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:02,702
relationships, then we have to add them

552
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:05,850
explicitly. So let's

553
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,522
add some connections between these

554
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:13,202
different segments of the environment to

555
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:16,690
turn that set into a graph that

556
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,426
says explicitly, for example, that the

557
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:22,006
light green segment is attached to the

558
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,910
light blue segment, and it's also

559
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,870
attached to the dark green segment,

560
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,534
and the dark blue segment is attached to

561
00:30:30,572 --> 00:30:32,486
the light blue segment and attached to

562
00:30:32,508 --> 00:30:35,594
the dark green segment. So now we have

563
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:37,450
something that's much more

564
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,722
mathematically complicated than a set.

565
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:42,294
We have a graph that has some connection

566
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,242
information. So we have a connection

567
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:47,358
topological. Now,

568
00:30:47,444 --> 00:30:49,774
adding this topology does something very

569
00:30:49,812 --> 00:30:51,642
important. It breaks the exchange

570
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:55,086
symmetry that is there if you just have

571
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:57,780
a set. So if we just have a set,

572
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,426
it doesn't make any difference if I

573
00:31:01,608 --> 00:31:05,314
exchange, for example, the positions of

574
00:31:05,352 --> 00:31:09,026
the upper right light blue segment with

575
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:12,070
the upper left light green segment. But

576
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,338
if we have this connection topology,

577
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:17,462
then it does make a difference. Right,

578
00:31:17,596 --> 00:31:21,720
I've twisted the graph around,

579
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,242
and if I have to break connections to

580
00:31:25,296 --> 00:31:26,890
exchange things, then I've actually

581
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,330
changed the topology.

582
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,214
So adding a topology,

583
00:31:32,342 --> 00:31:35,658
adding connections, can disrupt

584
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:39,534
a symmetry that's there if

585
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:40,990
there is no topology.

586
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,566
So now let's think about, now we have

587
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:48,594
the structure that's required to think

588
00:31:48,632 --> 00:31:50,100
about something happening.

589
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:55,010
So suppose that at some

590
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,850
time, as measured in the bit counter

591
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,490
time reference frame of the observing

592
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,994
system, something happens. So a dot

593
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:07,190
appears in the light green segment.

594
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,058
And we can express this actually in

595
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,814
the notation of quantum field theory.

596
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:17,914
We can think of the

597
00:32:17,952 --> 00:32:22,474
light green segment as a field and

598
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:25,166
the dot appearing is the occurrence of

599
00:32:25,188 --> 00:32:27,200
an excitation in that field.

600
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,702
And so we can write this notation that

601
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:34,778
says that the green field was excited

602
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:38,770
to produce a dot which is up arrow Green

603
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,570
dot.

604
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,860
And sometime after that

605
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,706
it may turn out that the dot disappears

606
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:53,254
in the green field and some sort

607
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:55,394
of dot appears down in the dark blue

608
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:58,694
field. And again, we can write

609
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:00,662
this in this kind of creation and

610
00:33:00,716 --> 00:33:03,642
destruction operator notation that one

611
00:33:03,696 --> 00:33:07,194
has in quantum field theory. And so this

612
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:11,050
says that the green field is no longer

613
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,322
excited, but now the dark blue field is

614
00:33:13,376 --> 00:33:16,670
excited. So this doesn't

615
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,370
imply anything about these excitations

616
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,114
being the same. In fact, they're

617
00:33:21,162 --> 00:33:23,806
completely different. One is an

618
00:33:23,828 --> 00:33:25,934
excitation of the green field and one is

619
00:33:25,972 --> 00:33:28,786
an excitation of the blue field. But at

620
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:30,786
least now something is happening in the

621
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:34,754
environment. So we can think about what

622
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:38,450
does it take for an observer to

623
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,086
notice that something is happening in

624
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:44,600
its environment? It has to be able to

625
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,134
detect a change occurring in

626
00:33:50,172 --> 00:33:53,660
some segment of its environment, and

627
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:58,090
that change can involve something

628
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,814
happening or something stopping

629
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:02,074
happening in that segment of its

630
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:06,126
environment. But it doesn't yet

631
00:34:06,228 --> 00:34:08,958
have to have any idea of what an object

632
00:34:09,044 --> 00:34:14,734
is. But we can add that if

633
00:34:14,772 --> 00:34:16,670
the system has a memory,

634
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:27,200
we can have the system connect these

635
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,206
events happening in different parts of

636
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:33,762
its environment. So if the system has

637
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:37,118
a memory that has some number of steps,

638
00:34:37,294 --> 00:34:40,786
I'll say n steps, but here it

639
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:42,610
could even just be two steps.

640
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:48,454
It can see transitions between these two

641
00:34:48,492 --> 00:34:52,198
different states, where there's a dot in

642
00:34:52,204 --> 00:34:55,238
the green field and then a dot in the

643
00:34:55,324 --> 00:34:57,398
dark blue field, and then a dot in the

644
00:34:57,404 --> 00:34:59,366
green field, and then a dot in the dark

645
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:02,074
blue field, and then a dot in the green

646
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:05,322
field, et cetera. So I've expressed this

647
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:08,010
in this sort of field theory notation

648
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,934
over on the right side. And what this is

649
00:35:13,972 --> 00:35:16,874
is a flip flop. It's an observed

650
00:35:16,922 --> 00:35:20,874
periodic behavior. So this

651
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:24,610
is the basic idea behind a clock.

652
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:31,170
So any observer that can see this number

653
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,950
of time steps internally can

654
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,398
interpret what's going on in its

655
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:39,826
external environment. As a clock

656
00:35:39,858 --> 00:35:43,910
ticking. It can see some aperiodic.

657
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:49,190
So as long as you can have memory

658
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,900
and the ability to detect change,

659
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,034
you can see periodic behavior in the

660
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:57,194
environment. So you can see the

661
00:35:57,232 --> 00:35:59,470
environment acting like a clock.

662
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,158
So let's think a bit about what this

663
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:09,486
does and does not require. So, seeing a

664
00:36:09,508 --> 00:36:13,278
clock in the environment requires having

665
00:36:13,444 --> 00:36:16,330
distinguishable, non exchangeable

666
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,526
sectors of the environment. So you have

667
00:36:18,548 --> 00:36:21,374
to have this connection topology that

668
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:24,566
breaks the exchange symmetry. It

669
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:27,458
requires having these sectors implement

670
00:36:27,554 --> 00:36:30,758
some sort of flip flop. So something

671
00:36:30,844 --> 00:36:33,958
aperiodic happening, and you have to

672
00:36:33,964 --> 00:36:36,154
have enough memory to see that

673
00:36:36,192 --> 00:36:39,370
periodicity, but it

674
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,898
doesn't require any sense of object

675
00:36:41,984 --> 00:36:45,514
identity. So the

676
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:48,106
excitation in the green part and the

677
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:50,062
excitation in the blue part can still

678
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:52,222
just be field excitations of the green

679
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,600
part and the blue part.

680
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,462
There's nothing that says that those

681
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,254
have to be the same thing. They just

682
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:02,514
have to appear and disappear in some

683
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:05,698
periodic way. And having

684
00:37:05,784 --> 00:37:08,580
clock doesn't require a metric space.

685
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,834
You don't need to have any sense of

686
00:37:10,872 --> 00:37:13,730
distance defined on the environment.

687
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,030
You just have to have this segmentation

688
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,058
that is not rearrangeable. So this tells

689
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:23,574
us something extremely important, which

690
00:37:23,612 --> 00:37:26,682
is that time is more fundamental than

691
00:37:26,736 --> 00:37:30,822
space. Time in the exterior environment

692
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:33,814
is much simpler and easier to observe

693
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:36,570
than space in the exterior environment.

694
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,230
So if we're thinking biologically about

695
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,734
phylogeny, we might expect to see

696
00:37:42,932 --> 00:37:46,634
organisms that can detect periodic

697
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,970
behavior in the external environment

698
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,454
long before they can detect spatial

699
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,150
organization in the exterior

700
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,770
environment. And we know that organisms,

701
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:00,734
even down to microbial mats, can respond

702
00:38:00,782 --> 00:38:06,134
to the diurnal cycle. So we

703
00:38:06,172 --> 00:38:08,214
know that organisms, in a sense, can

704
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:11,382
detect environmental clocks, even

705
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:13,446
organisms that we have no reason to

706
00:38:13,468 --> 00:38:17,050
believe, divide the environment up into

707
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,926
spaces or the sort of space that we're

708
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:22,540
used to, like a Euclidean space.

709
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,754
So adding space to

710
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:30,590
this Idea of time in the Environment.

711
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,638
So the Next step is to be

712
00:38:36,644 --> 00:38:40,414
able to see motion and being Able to

713
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:43,842
see one thing move from

714
00:38:43,896 --> 00:38:46,242
one segment of the Environment to

715
00:38:46,296 --> 00:38:49,618
another segment, as opposed to something

716
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,522
happening in One segment, and then

717
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:53,890
something happens in another segment.

718
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,806
One has to have this idea of object

719
00:38:56,908 --> 00:39:00,646
persistence, that there's a thing

720
00:39:00,748 --> 00:39:04,626
that has an Identity, and Its identity

721
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:06,700
doesn't change over time,

722
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,282
and it doesn't change when you move it

723
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,502
someplace else. When it appears

724
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:15,046
someplace else in the Environment, it's

725
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:16,460
the same object.

726
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:21,694
So this is an

727
00:39:21,732 --> 00:39:23,918
idea that psychologists call object

728
00:39:24,004 --> 00:39:27,102
persistence, and it's an idea that

729
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,970
physicists call translational

730
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,930
invariance. Translational invariance

731
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,426
means two things. It means that if I

732
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:39,298
have an object and I move it to a

733
00:39:39,304 --> 00:39:41,442
different location, I don't change the

734
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:44,854
object. It's the Same object that I move

735
00:39:44,892 --> 00:39:47,490
from here to there. So the location

736
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,790
doesn't change the object. And it also

737
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,894
means the reverse of that. It means that

738
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:56,310
the object doesn't change the location.

739
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,994
My container remains invariant Even

740
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,730
though I move the object around in it.

741
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,978
So these are kind of the two phases of

742
00:40:08,064 --> 00:40:10,518
translational invariance, and they're

743
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,990
the two faces of object persistence.

744
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,502
As the object moves through time, Its

745
00:40:17,556 --> 00:40:21,262
identity remains fixed, and it doesn't

746
00:40:21,326 --> 00:40:23,378
Change the time that it's moving

747
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:27,166
through. So if I'm measuring Its Motion

748
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:31,262
With a clock, moving the object doesn't

749
00:40:31,326 --> 00:40:34,710
Change the clock. These are

750
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,590
clearly very classical ideas.

751
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:42,690
And we talked about earlier Classical

752
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:43,750
communication.

753
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:49,062
And when we talked about classical

754
00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:51,034
communication in, for Example, the

755
00:40:51,072 --> 00:40:54,326
context of a Bell EPR experiment,

756
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,922
we talked about the observers being able

757
00:40:56,976 --> 00:41:01,166
to write down some data on

758
00:41:01,188 --> 00:41:04,766
a piece of paper or on a Disk drive or

759
00:41:04,788 --> 00:41:08,158
something and hand those Data to someone

760
00:41:08,244 --> 00:41:11,062
Else. So this is Translational

761
00:41:11,146 --> 00:41:14,210
Invariance. The Data Can't Change When

762
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,134
Alice Gives it to Bob. Otherwise,

763
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:18,942
there isn't Classical Communication

764
00:41:19,006 --> 00:41:22,354
taking Place. And of course, there's an

765
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:25,734
up to noise built into here, right? The

766
00:41:25,772 --> 00:41:27,922
piece of paper might get wet and the ink

767
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,534
might run a little bit, but it's still

768
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,838
the same message. There's still some

769
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,430
identity being assumed.

770
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:39,674
So object persistence is not an

771
00:41:39,712 --> 00:41:42,234
idea we get from quantum theory. It's an

772
00:41:42,272 --> 00:41:45,094
idea that we impose on top of quantum

773
00:41:45,142 --> 00:41:48,354
theory. And it's this idea that's

774
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,834
intrinsically classical. So we're

775
00:41:51,882 --> 00:41:54,894
looking right here at the quantum to

776
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:58,734
classical transition. This is it. This

777
00:41:58,772 --> 00:42:01,106
is what gets added to quantum theory to

778
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:03,474
get classical physics. It's this idea of

779
00:42:03,512 --> 00:42:07,202
object persistence. Now, once we have

780
00:42:07,256 --> 00:42:09,474
object persistence, we can kind of go to

781
00:42:09,512 --> 00:42:12,100
town constructing space,

782
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,560
and here's how we do it.

783
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,122
We all learned about object persistence

784
00:42:25,186 --> 00:42:28,380
this way when we were six months old,

785
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:32,060
doing motor babbling and

786
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,674
observing our hands and feeling how our

787
00:42:35,712 --> 00:42:39,118
bodies worked and seeing

788
00:42:39,204 --> 00:42:42,574
objects that we could manipulate and

789
00:42:42,612 --> 00:42:44,762
that didn't change when we manipulated

790
00:42:44,826 --> 00:42:48,830
them. So this is the birth of object

791
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,874
persistence. This is the birth of

792
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:54,370
classicality in human

793
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,330
psychology.

794
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,074
So now let's start thinking about

795
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:03,106
building a coordinate system. What's a

796
00:43:03,128 --> 00:43:04,722
coordinate system? A coordinate system

797
00:43:04,776 --> 00:43:06,486
is just a set of labels that are

798
00:43:06,508 --> 00:43:09,126
attached to these segments of the

799
00:43:09,148 --> 00:43:12,418
environment. And to build a coordinate

800
00:43:12,434 --> 00:43:15,334
system, you have to have an origin. And

801
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:18,442
an origin means an object, something

802
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:21,126
that's fixed, something that doesn't

803
00:43:21,158 --> 00:43:25,034
move around. And so

804
00:43:25,232 --> 00:43:28,582
a coordinate system requires the ability

805
00:43:28,646 --> 00:43:31,550
to identify. A stigmergic memory

806
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,230
requires the ability to find something

807
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,830
in the environment that has a meaning

808
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,080
that stays constant over time.

809
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,474
And that's what a stigmergic memory is.

810
00:43:45,512 --> 00:43:48,082
It's something in the environment that

811
00:43:48,136 --> 00:43:51,186
provides us with a memory resource that

812
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:53,380
we can count on being the same.

813
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,990
And it's having

814
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:02,310
this fixed point that allows us to label

815
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,806
these connected segments of the

816
00:44:04,828 --> 00:44:08,310
environment that contain

817
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:11,530
objects that move and be able to

818
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,882
say, okay, the object moved from this

819
00:44:13,936 --> 00:44:16,554
part of the Environment to another part,

820
00:44:16,752 --> 00:44:19,854
and I can give those parts labels with

821
00:44:19,892 --> 00:44:22,074
respect to this other part that doesn't

822
00:44:22,122 --> 00:44:25,280
move, this origin point.

823
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,370
And once I have this, I can construct

824
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,530
other invariances. So, for example,

825
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,070
I can consider an object that rotates

826
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,842
around this origin without changing its

827
00:44:37,896 --> 00:44:41,202
identity, and that defines what's called

828
00:44:41,256 --> 00:44:43,170
rotational invariance.

829
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:48,102
And I can also talk about an object that

830
00:44:48,156 --> 00:44:52,242
gets bigger and smaller compared

831
00:44:52,306 --> 00:44:55,734
to this fixed point and

832
00:44:55,772 --> 00:44:58,906
that defines radial distance. And if you

833
00:44:58,928 --> 00:45:01,990
think about the baby in the previous

834
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:05,114
slide that's doing motor babbling, it

835
00:45:05,152 --> 00:45:08,246
sees things getting smaller as it moves

836
00:45:08,278 --> 00:45:11,930
them farther away so the visual

837
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:15,678
system does this computation for us and

838
00:45:15,764 --> 00:45:18,622
constructs this radial coordinate for us

839
00:45:18,676 --> 00:45:21,118
with respect to our bodies, or

840
00:45:21,204 --> 00:45:24,340
specifically our heads, our eyes.

841
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:29,394
So in

842
00:45:29,432 --> 00:45:33,774
doing this very early motor

843
00:45:33,822 --> 00:45:35,814
activity, we're actually building the

844
00:45:35,852 --> 00:45:39,426
spatial coordinate system for our brains

845
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:42,034
that's implemented by the hippocampus,

846
00:45:42,162 --> 00:45:44,390
the place cells in the hippocampus.

847
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,314
And if I have an origin point in the

848
00:45:48,352 --> 00:45:51,690
environment, I can also

849
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,954
infer that I am moving, that I have

850
00:45:54,992 --> 00:45:58,058
changed my location with respect to that

851
00:45:58,144 --> 00:46:01,898
object. And that's

852
00:46:02,074 --> 00:46:04,442
a considerably more complicated

853
00:46:04,506 --> 00:46:06,126
inference, because you have to have a

854
00:46:06,148 --> 00:46:09,534
representation of the self of you to

855
00:46:09,572 --> 00:46:12,674
say, I moved. So this is something that

856
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:14,994
comes after you've developed this

857
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:17,218
spatial coordinate system. You have to

858
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:19,250
be able to locate, in a sense,

859
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,738
metacognitively, a particular object

860
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:25,400
that's you in that coordinate system.

861
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,558
So we're going to set that aside and now

862
00:46:29,644 --> 00:46:32,914
talk about adding

863
00:46:32,962 --> 00:46:35,350
some numbers. So, adding a metric,

864
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:40,426
and adding a metric requires another

865
00:46:40,528 --> 00:46:43,626
particular kind of object, which is

866
00:46:43,648 --> 00:46:48,694
a ruler, a particular fixed

867
00:46:48,742 --> 00:46:52,494
object that can be moved around and that

868
00:46:52,532 --> 00:46:55,102
has translational invariance, and

869
00:46:55,156 --> 00:46:58,206
translational invariance up to some

870
00:46:58,308 --> 00:47:00,830
transformation, up to some tensor.

871
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,306
And in Euclidean space, that tensor is

872
00:47:04,328 --> 00:47:08,018
the identity. So in Euclidean space,

873
00:47:08,104 --> 00:47:10,834
you have perfect translational and

874
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:14,018
rotational invariance. As you

875
00:47:14,024 --> 00:47:17,254
get into general relativity, then the

876
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,606
ruler can actually change its length as

877
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,182
you rotate, or the ruler can change its

878
00:47:22,236 --> 00:47:25,206
length as it moves through space. So

879
00:47:25,308 --> 00:47:28,230
effectively, your Spacetime can deform,

880
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,186
the coordinates of your Spacetime can

881
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:32,186
deform, and that gives you the

882
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:34,234
representation of mass, of cOurse, in

883
00:47:34,272 --> 00:47:38,854
general relativity. So we talked several

884
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:42,202
sessions ago about quantum reference

885
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:45,738
frames, and I used the example of rulers

886
00:47:45,754 --> 00:47:48,030
and clocks as quantum reference frames.

887
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:51,600
So now we see how to construct those

888
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:56,254
from observations and symmetry

889
00:47:56,302 --> 00:47:59,250
breaking and object identity,

890
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:03,426
all of which we need to define a

891
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:05,334
quantum reference frame out in the

892
00:48:05,372 --> 00:48:07,110
environment, like a ruler.

893
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,806
And notice that we don't need any of

894
00:48:10,828 --> 00:48:14,626
that environmental stuff to define

895
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:18,678
those QRFs within our own processing.

896
00:48:18,774 --> 00:48:23,066
And in fact, the ones that exist within

897
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:26,378
us, we have no direct access

898
00:48:26,464 --> 00:48:29,914
to. We can look at someone else's brain

899
00:48:29,962 --> 00:48:31,754
and talk about their spatial

900
00:48:31,802 --> 00:48:34,686
representation system, but we can't look

901
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:37,182
inside our own brains and talk about our

902
00:48:37,236 --> 00:48:39,280
spatial representation system.

903
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:44,260
So this is how we get a metric space

904
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:49,342
from the ground up. And we've

905
00:48:49,406 --> 00:48:50,978
talked about this from a very

906
00:48:51,064 --> 00:48:53,906
psychological or biological point of

907
00:48:53,928 --> 00:48:54,500
view,

908
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,794
starting from sort of motor

909
00:48:59,842 --> 00:49:03,490
capabilities, motor babbling,

910
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:08,062
for example, a measure of effort

911
00:49:08,226 --> 00:49:10,620
which gives you some sense of mass.

912
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:13,766
So if it's easy to move something, it's

913
00:49:13,798 --> 00:49:15,722
light, and if it's hard to move

914
00:49:15,776 --> 00:49:19,610
something, it's heavy. And we

915
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,822
understand that when we're six months

916
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,774
old, because we can measure how much

917
00:49:23,812 --> 00:49:25,614
force we're having to apply with our

918
00:49:25,652 --> 00:49:29,210
muscles. We have a reference

919
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,466
internally for this force that we're

920
00:49:31,498 --> 00:49:35,618
applying, and we use

921
00:49:35,704 --> 00:49:38,638
that internal measurement to attribute

922
00:49:38,814 --> 00:49:41,506
this idea of mass to things in the

923
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:44,434
environment. We have to have memory from

924
00:49:44,472 --> 00:49:48,086
manipulations. We have to be able to

925
00:49:48,268 --> 00:49:51,510
identify invariances that define objects

926
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:55,558
object persistence. And we have to be

927
00:49:55,564 --> 00:49:59,242
able to build a ruler that we can move

928
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,580
around and use to define a metric space.

929
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,714
Now, this is very different from the way

930
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:08,426
physicists approach this. If you look

931
00:50:08,448 --> 00:50:10,502
at the physics literature, then people

932
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:13,374
start with information transfer. They

933
00:50:13,412 --> 00:50:16,602
talk about entanglement as a basic

934
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:20,206
resource. There's a lot

935
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:23,822
of discussion of bulkboundary duality.

936
00:50:23,886 --> 00:50:27,666
And the most well known one is the

937
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:29,810
duality between antidicitter space,

938
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,810
which is the sort of space you see

939
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,014
inside a black hole, and conformal

940
00:50:36,062 --> 00:50:38,566
field theory, a quantum field theory on

941
00:50:38,588 --> 00:50:40,920
the boundary of the black hole. So

942
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,262
things you can see, for example, going

943
00:50:44,316 --> 00:50:46,694
on, on the horizon of a black hole are

944
00:50:46,732 --> 00:50:50,330
dual to the geometry and the interior.

945
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,906
By this mathematical Relationship, you

946
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:56,810
can use that mathematical relationship

947
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,806
to construct quantum error correcting

948
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:03,040
code. Code by

949
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,986
using the symmetries of the field theory

950
00:51:07,178 --> 00:51:09,978
as a resource for redundancy that allows

951
00:51:09,994 --> 00:51:11,886
you to represent the same thing in

952
00:51:11,908 --> 00:51:14,786
different places. And as soon as you can

953
00:51:14,808 --> 00:51:17,380
do that, you can build up a network of

954
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,602
elements that look basically like

955
00:51:19,656 --> 00:51:24,434
elements of a lattice. And a lattice is

956
00:51:24,472 --> 00:51:27,830
a graph to which you can assign

957
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:31,846
symmetric relationships, and you get a

958
00:51:31,868 --> 00:51:35,042
metric space. And in physics,

959
00:51:35,106 --> 00:51:37,506
typically, the goal is to get Einstein's

960
00:51:37,538 --> 00:51:40,170
equations out of this to start with some

961
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,026
information, theoretic sorts of

962
00:51:42,048 --> 00:51:45,386
constructs, and get the equations of

963
00:51:45,408 --> 00:51:48,954
general relativity. But what are the

964
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:51,886
equations of general mean? These are

965
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:54,494
things that Einstein derived by doing

966
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,070
fairly simple thought experiments,

967
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:03,780
using the invariances of

968
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,260
ordinary Euclidean space,

969
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:10,322
combined with ideas from special

970
00:52:10,376 --> 00:52:12,194
relativity about the speed of light

971
00:52:12,232 --> 00:52:15,926
being constant. And he added the

972
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:17,894
principle of equivalence, which is the

973
00:52:17,932 --> 00:52:22,418
idea that essentially

974
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,342
mass and acceleration are the same

975
00:52:24,396 --> 00:52:28,214
thing, or that gravity and

976
00:52:28,252 --> 00:52:29,906
acceleration are the same, that weight

977
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,980
and acceleration are the same thing.

978
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:36,860
So it's at least reasonable to expect

979
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:42,400
that this

980
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:46,154
inferential process that's

981
00:52:46,202 --> 00:52:49,726
going on in theoretical physics is

982
00:52:49,828 --> 00:52:53,106
generating the same thing, although in a

983
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:56,434
very formalized way that we can

984
00:52:56,472 --> 00:53:00,174
generate by thinking about how organisms

985
00:53:00,222 --> 00:53:03,746
deal with their environments. And so I

986
00:53:03,768 --> 00:53:06,854
want to leave this with you

987
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,800
as the second hypothesis here.

988
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:16,326
The first one was the hypothesis about a

989
00:53:16,348 --> 00:53:18,970
trivial renormalization group flow

990
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:21,610
across scales and biology.

991
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:26,042
The second hypothesis is that these

992
00:53:26,096 --> 00:53:29,338
two approaches to emergent Spacetime are

993
00:53:29,424 --> 00:53:31,920
actually giving us the same information.

994
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,006
And maybe starting out with the

995
00:53:37,028 --> 00:53:40,222
same information, in fact, that we may

996
00:53:40,276 --> 00:53:44,334
be able to think about these fundamental

997
00:53:44,382 --> 00:53:48,642
building blocks of information

998
00:53:48,776 --> 00:53:51,858
flow and entanglement. In terms

999
00:53:51,944 --> 00:53:54,526
of the sorts of perceptual relationships

1000
00:53:54,558 --> 00:53:57,462
that we've been talking about in this

1001
00:53:57,516 --> 00:54:01,154
class. So there's

1002
00:54:01,202 --> 00:54:04,934
our second hypothesis to

1003
00:54:04,972 --> 00:54:08,554
think about going forward. And I just

1004
00:54:08,592 --> 00:54:10,874
want to leave you with the idea that

1005
00:54:10,992 --> 00:54:15,322
organisms at least manage this very

1006
00:54:15,456 --> 00:54:21,262
interesting process that

1007
00:54:21,316 --> 00:54:23,710
we can think of starting as starting

1008
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:27,390
with the construct of memory.

1009
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:31,722
Organisms have memory at multiple

1010
00:54:31,786 --> 00:54:35,780
scales, and it's memory that allows them

1011
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:38,754
to formulate the idea that there are

1012
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:42,226
objects. And as soon

1013
00:54:42,248 --> 00:54:45,918
as you have objects that persist, you

1014
00:54:45,944 --> 00:54:49,046
have a source of redundancy. So you can

1015
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:52,790
do error correction. And if you can do

1016
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,542
error correction, if you can move the

1017
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:58,954
same thing from one place to another and

1018
00:54:58,992 --> 00:55:01,020
have it encode the same information,

1019
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:03,690
then you can build Spacetime.

1020
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:07,786
And as soon as you have Spacetime, you

1021
00:55:07,808 --> 00:55:10,810
can use the Spacetime as more memory.

1022
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:14,158
You can use the Spacetime itself,

1023
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,160
quantum error correcting code. Code.

1024
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:20,250
Because Spacetime has the nice ability

1025
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:23,790
to hold lots of copies of

1026
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,898
some informative structures. So you can

1027
00:55:25,924 --> 00:55:27,922
build libraries, or you can build

1028
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:29,298
computers, or you can build the

1029
00:55:29,304 --> 00:55:32,162
Internet, if you have Spacetime, which

1030
00:55:32,216 --> 00:55:33,826
gives you more memory, which gives you

1031
00:55:33,848 --> 00:55:35,598
more object persistence, which gives you

1032
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:38,034
more error correction. And the circle

1033
00:55:38,082 --> 00:55:41,766
just spins around. So organisms do this,

1034
00:55:41,948 --> 00:55:44,054
and the question is, how does it get off

1035
00:55:44,092 --> 00:55:49,034
the ground? And next

1036
00:55:49,072 --> 00:55:51,898
time, we can at least speculate about

1037
00:55:51,984 --> 00:55:55,194
that kind of origin of life type of

1038
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:59,820
question in the context of the FEP and

1039
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:03,294
its realization in simple systems of

1040
00:56:03,332 --> 00:56:06,766
communicating observers. So,

1041
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:10,446
as always, I encourage you to use the

1042
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:14,622
interactive Q A. The fifth discussion

1043
00:56:14,686 --> 00:56:16,702
session with Ander, who's unfortunately

1044
00:56:16,766 --> 00:56:19,874
not here today, will be the last day of

1045
00:56:19,912 --> 00:56:23,582
September, Saturday at five, as usual,

1046
00:56:23,726 --> 00:56:26,346
05:00 European time, 08:00 California

1047
00:56:26,398 --> 00:56:29,366
time. And then the last session of the

1048
00:56:29,388 --> 00:56:32,150
class will be the twelveth of October.

1049
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:35,894
So, thank you very much, and I look

1050
00:56:35,932 --> 00:56:37,574
forward to your questions in the

1051
00:56:37,612 --> 00:56:39,100
interactive Q and A.

1052
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:45,740
Awesome.

1053
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:51,042
Thank you, Chris. Can I ask some short

1054
00:56:51,096 --> 00:56:54,238
questions? Sure. All right.

1055
00:56:54,424 --> 00:56:57,618
So, first from Lana wrote,

1056
00:56:57,794 --> 00:57:00,882
is the periodicity, the time lengths

1057
00:57:00,946 --> 00:57:03,510
between and during the excitations built

1058
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,658
in. So this was when we had the four

1059
00:57:06,764 --> 00:57:09,066
cells and there was the inklings of a

1060
00:57:09,088 --> 00:57:11,340
clock coming into play.

1061
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:21,936
It I

1062
00:57:21,958 --> 00:57:29,268
think the simplest answer is that if

1063
00:57:29,354 --> 00:57:32,516
nothing else is happening in the

1064
00:57:32,538 --> 00:57:34,796
environment except this periodic

1065
00:57:34,848 --> 00:57:39,930
behavior, then the.

1066
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:45,288
It's not actually meaningful to talk yet

1067
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:48,380
about the time between the events.

1068
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,750
So if I have

1069
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,704
a system that's quasiperiodic,

1070
00:57:57,752 --> 00:57:58,590
for example,

1071
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,984
and nothing else is going on in my

1072
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:07,164
environment, then I can't distinguish

1073
00:58:07,212 --> 00:58:09,936
that from a perfectly periodic system

1074
00:58:10,118 --> 00:58:12,140
because I would have to have a perfectly

1075
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:15,344
periodic reference to know

1076
00:58:15,382 --> 00:58:18,000
that the other system was apyotic.

1077
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,024
And if you think about the internal

1078
00:58:21,072 --> 00:58:24,384
clock being driven

1079
00:58:24,432 --> 00:58:27,930
by information flow into the system,

1080
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,736
then something has to be happening in

1081
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,656
the environment for information to be

1082
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,480
flowing into the system and being

1083
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,950
counted. So,

1084
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,512
again, as we talked about a few sessions

1085
00:58:41,576 --> 00:58:45,532
ago, the internal memory only gets

1086
00:58:45,586 --> 00:58:47,550
updated when something happens.

1087
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,604
So internal and external get tied

1088
00:58:52,652 --> 00:58:56,064
together. This is

1089
00:58:56,102 --> 00:58:58,320
why we can use external clocks,

1090
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,736
but it's also why we depend on external

1091
00:59:02,768 --> 00:59:07,300
clocks, because our

1092
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:09,524
intuitive sense of time is very

1093
00:59:09,562 --> 00:59:13,716
malleable. And so

1094
00:59:13,898 --> 00:59:16,756
we actually, as humans, use external

1095
00:59:16,788 --> 00:59:20,500
clocks to correct for the malleability

1096
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,704
of our own intuitive sense

1097
00:59:23,742 --> 00:59:24,570
of time.

1098
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,716
Wow. And there's probably a lot to be

1099
00:59:28,738 --> 00:59:31,692
said for that procrustian nature of

1100
00:59:31,746 --> 00:59:35,036
having the konometer, the clock on the

1101
00:59:35,058 --> 00:59:38,524
wall, and the tick, tick, tick as

1102
00:59:38,562 --> 00:59:42,050
an evolutionarily novel ruler of time,

1103
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,960
playing a logistical role in time

1104
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:47,760
bound.

1105
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:53,552
And think of earlier clocks

1106
00:59:53,616 --> 00:59:55,604
that earlier cultures have used and that

1107
00:59:55,642 --> 00:59:58,100
animals use. I mean, we have the solar

1108
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,420
clock, the lunar clock, et cetera,

1109
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,844
and the orbit of Venus clock

1110
01:00:04,912 --> 01:00:07,224
that was so important to the Mayans and

1111
01:00:07,262 --> 01:00:10,408
so on. So there are lots of available

1112
01:00:10,494 --> 01:00:13,544
clocks in the environment, if you have

1113
01:00:13,582 --> 01:00:17,032
the ability to notice them and

1114
01:00:17,086 --> 01:00:18,856
enough memory to realize that they're

1115
01:00:18,888 --> 01:00:22,140
clocks. Awesome.

1116
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:24,140
All right, here's a question from

1117
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:27,580
Upcycle Club. They wrote, how does

1118
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:29,784
representing the network structure and

1119
01:00:29,842 --> 01:00:32,476
dynamics with quantum embeddings affect

1120
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:34,336
the semantic interpretation of the

1121
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:35,040
network?

1122
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:45,962
The the embedding theory is the

1123
01:00:46,016 --> 01:00:48,266
simplest semantic interpretation of the

1124
01:00:48,288 --> 01:00:51,420
network. So.

1125
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,890
And again, a good way to think of this

1126
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,980
is through the lens of computer science.

1127
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,352
As soon as you have a programming

1128
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:13,660
language that allows variable binding,

1129
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:18,272
then you've built a very simple kind of

1130
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:20,240
semantics into the language.

1131
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,584
If you have X as a variable and you

1132
01:01:25,622 --> 01:01:28,710
have variable binding, then at different

1133
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,230
times in the execution of the program,

1134
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,552
X can have different causal consequences

1135
01:01:37,616 --> 01:01:40,516
for downstream computation because it's

1136
01:01:40,548 --> 01:01:43,224
been bound to a different value, so it

1137
01:01:43,262 --> 01:01:47,112
has different semantics. So the

1138
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:48,730
semantics of X,

1139
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,500
again, go back to Gregory Bateson.

1140
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,536
The basis of semantics is differences

1141
01:01:58,568 --> 01:02:00,108
that make a difference, make a

1142
01:02:00,114 --> 01:02:01,868
difference to behavior, make a

1143
01:02:01,874 --> 01:02:03,420
difference to actionability.

1144
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,464
So variable binding gives

1145
01:02:08,502 --> 01:02:10,288
you differences that actually make a

1146
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:12,610
difference to what the program does.

1147
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:18,310
So what is that?

1148
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,864
That is the semantics

1149
01:02:22,912 --> 01:02:25,380
that's assigned by your embedding theory

1150
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,256
between what the programming language is

1151
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:31,064
doing and what the operating system is

1152
01:02:31,102 --> 01:02:35,112
doing and so forth. And I think it's no

1153
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:39,064
surprise that the

1154
01:02:39,102 --> 01:02:42,604
semantics of programming languages end

1155
01:02:42,642 --> 01:02:45,820
up being represented with these very

1156
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:48,540
general mathematical constructs like

1157
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:52,508
category theory, which are

1158
01:02:52,674 --> 01:02:56,524
essentially tools

1159
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:59,970
for representing arbitrary relations

1160
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,636
between systems. And that's

1161
01:03:04,668 --> 01:03:08,180
what embedding theories are. They're

1162
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,472
theories that state relationships

1163
01:03:11,536 --> 01:03:12,740
between systems.

1164
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:20,060
Awesome, and very provocative to explore

1165
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:24,432
on the topological and life and on the

1166
01:03:24,486 --> 01:03:27,936
Spacetime and matter sides, which are of

1167
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:32,032
course, seamlessly integrated through,

1168
01:03:32,086 --> 01:03:34,660
if only our own experiences.

1169
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,096
Yeah, this is another place where it's

1170
01:03:38,128 --> 01:03:40,404
useful to go back to this difference

1171
01:03:40,522 --> 01:03:44,176
between reductive theories and scale

1172
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:46,296
free theories. Scale free theories are

1173
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:50,072
all about semantics because they

1174
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,040
represent the existence of stuff

1175
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:53,816
happening at different scales. And so

1176
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:56,010
they naturally raise the question of

1177
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:00,476
what are these relationships, what are

1178
01:04:00,498 --> 01:04:04,332
these embedding theories? And in

1179
01:04:04,386 --> 01:04:07,336
reductive theories there's a very deep

1180
01:04:07,368 --> 01:04:09,550
sense in which semantics doesn't matter.

1181
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:16,752
If you think that all that's going on

1182
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,516
that's important is the stuff that's

1183
01:04:19,548 --> 01:04:21,360
going on at the Planck scale,

1184
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,692
then you don't need any semantics,

1185
01:04:25,836 --> 01:04:26,530
right?

1186
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,830
You see this in late 60s,

1187
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,010
early 70s,

1188
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:41,848
old fashioned AI, where people

1189
01:04:41,934 --> 01:04:45,524
talk about computation,

1190
01:04:45,572 --> 01:04:48,344
is purely syntactic. And this is a very

1191
01:04:48,382 --> 01:04:50,180
reductionist view of computation. It

1192
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:53,692
leaves out the semantics, and without

1193
01:04:53,746 --> 01:04:55,484
the semantics, the computation is

1194
01:04:55,522 --> 01:04:58,316
useless. It doesn't tell us anything at

1195
01:04:58,338 --> 01:05:00,350
all unless we can map it to something.

1196
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:06,224
So we have

1197
01:05:06,262 --> 01:05:09,372
this philosophy of science tradition

1198
01:05:09,436 --> 01:05:11,424
that tells us that semantics is not

1199
01:05:11,462 --> 01:05:15,172
important, and we end up with

1200
01:05:15,226 --> 01:05:18,832
tools like the FEP that essentially

1201
01:05:18,896 --> 01:05:21,190
tell us that semantics is all important.

1202
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,730
And from a biological point of view,

1203
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,664
the most natural response is, of course,

1204
01:05:30,702 --> 01:05:32,536
we knew that all the time. That's why

1205
01:05:32,558 --> 01:05:33,720
we're doing ontology.

1206
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,630
So all of this ties together.

1207
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,944
Would you say that FEP says semantics

1208
01:05:43,992 --> 01:05:47,084
is important, and then what does it say

1209
01:05:47,122 --> 01:05:49,356
about what semantics are important? Or

1210
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:52,560
is that entirely left up to the modeler?

1211
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:58,116
Well, it tells you a lot about what's

1212
01:05:58,148 --> 01:06:01,850
important for the system itself,

1213
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,484
right? The system itself is dealing with

1214
01:06:05,522 --> 01:06:09,800
its environment and it's

1215
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,830
trying to increase its predictive power.

1216
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,044
So it's building a theory of the

1217
01:06:16,082 --> 01:06:20,204
environment, and that theory

1218
01:06:20,252 --> 01:06:22,156
is intrinsically semantic, right? It's

1219
01:06:22,188 --> 01:06:25,248
about the environment and

1220
01:06:25,334 --> 01:06:26,800
it's actionable.

1221
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:32,324
The theory is meant to drive action on

1222
01:06:32,362 --> 01:06:36,000
the environment that will either yield

1223
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:39,524
more information or get

1224
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:43,220
the environment to behave,

1225
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:46,616
to do what I'm predicting it's going to

1226
01:06:46,638 --> 01:06:51,416
do. So I

1227
01:06:51,438 --> 01:06:54,324
think the FEP is intrinsically semantic

1228
01:06:54,372 --> 01:06:56,380
in that sense, that it's about an agent

1229
01:06:56,450 --> 01:07:00,204
modeling its environment. Yes. And about

1230
01:07:00,242 --> 01:07:03,932
the semantics of action, as opposed to

1231
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:08,552
a partial or limited semantics

1232
01:07:08,696 --> 01:07:11,696
of passive inference or semantics of

1233
01:07:11,718 --> 01:07:15,296
abstraction, which kind

1234
01:07:15,318 --> 01:07:18,256
of leaves the important link between the

1235
01:07:18,278 --> 01:07:19,952
agent and the environment through sense

1236
01:07:20,006 --> 01:07:22,768
making and decision selection basically

1237
01:07:22,854 --> 01:07:24,432
unaddressed because it's kind of

1238
01:07:24,486 --> 01:07:26,868
Descartes in the thought experiment in

1239
01:07:26,874 --> 01:07:28,644
the room. And here, when we actually

1240
01:07:28,682 --> 01:07:30,404
engage with the boundary of the room,

1241
01:07:30,602 --> 01:07:34,120
that's where we. Yeah, yeah.

1242
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:37,320
The FEP completely destroys

1243
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:40,932
this classical notion of the passive

1244
01:07:40,996 --> 01:07:45,076
observer, as does quantum

1245
01:07:45,108 --> 01:07:47,444
theory. There are no passive observers

1246
01:07:47,492 --> 01:07:50,984
in quantum theory. So this is a

1247
01:07:51,022 --> 01:07:53,176
construct that we inherited from a

1248
01:07:53,198 --> 01:07:57,044
classical worldview that is seriously

1249
01:07:57,092 --> 01:07:58,040
misleading.

1250
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,594
A lot more to say, but that's a great

1251
01:08:06,632 --> 01:08:09,170
place to end. Thank you, Chris.

1252
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:12,466
OK. Thank you, Daniel. And thanks to you

1253
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:15,506
all. And ask questions. See you

1254
01:08:15,528 --> 01:08:16,914
next time. Cheers. We'll see you next
