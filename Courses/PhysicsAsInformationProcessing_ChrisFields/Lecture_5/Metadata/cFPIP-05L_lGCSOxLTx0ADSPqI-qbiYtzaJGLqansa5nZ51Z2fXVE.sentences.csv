4200	4750	1	A	0.55524	You.
6720	8348	2	B	0.99992	Hello and welcome, everyone.
8514	15624	3	B	1.0	It is September 14, 2023, and we are in the course, physics as information processing.
15752	17150	4	B	0.90887	It's lecture five.
18080	20904	5	B	1.0	Looking forward to this lecture and then a little conversation.
20952	21884	6	B	0.99958	Chris, off to you.
21922	22670	7	B	0.99984	Thank you.
24800	25596	8	A	1.0	Okay.
25778	27100	9	A	0.99999	Thank you, Daniel.
27840	32340	10	A	1.0	And welcome to to session five of Physics of information processing.
33400	46680	11	A	1.0	And today we're going to talk about Spacetime, and particularly about the idea that Spacetime is emergent from information processing.
47340	54940	12	A	1.0	And this has now become a very mainstream idea in the quantum information and quantum gravity communities.
57360	65580	13	A	1.0	And there's still, of course, some people holding out for the idea that Spacetime is fundamental.
66260	93000	14	A	0.62276	But I would say that, at least in these communities, I expect it's become now the dominant idea that Spacetime is not fundamental, that Spacetime is not part of the basic ontology of reality or something like that, and that instead, Spacetime is a construct.
93660	98570	15	A	0.99982	So that's what today's session is going to be about.
99740	123360	16	A	0.99986	So for those of you who are just joining or who would like a little review, we started this course talking about quantum information theory and the idea that quantum information theory is actually a new science about systems that communicate across a boundary.
123700	137632	17	A	0.99	And the systems are always called Alice and Bob for kind of historical reasons, and emphasize that this new science is topological.
137696	140752	18	A	0.99997	It's about connectivity between systems.
140816	142596	19	A	0.64342	It's not geometric.
142788	146436	20	A	0.99992	So it doesn't assume a Spacetime embedding.
146628	152100	21	A	0.99998	So it leaves open the possibility that Spacetime is actually a construct.
152180	155150	22	A	1.0	It doesn't assume Spacetime up front.
156560	179824	23	A	0.55	And in the second session of the course, I think we talked about how this boundary could always be represented as an array of qubits, and that what the systems on each side of the boundary do to communicate is prepare and then measure the states of these qubits.
179872	191440	24	A	0.99963	So they communicate by exchanging classical information via a quantum channel.
192390	206630	25	A	0.61	And this introduces a particular kind of quantum noise whenever they don't share the reference frames that they use to prepare the bits and measure the bits.
206970	217646	26	A	0.99968	So it's not necessarily a perfect communication channel from a classicality fidelity point of view, but all of the noise is quantum noise.
217698	225100	27	A	0.95842	It's not classical, and it always derives from differences in the reference frames that are used by the two agents.
226830	236480	28	A	0.99999	We reformulated the free energy principle in this setting, and the free energy principle turns out to be very simple.
237010	245170	29	A	0.92	It turns out to be a classical limit of the principle of unitarity, which is just the principle that information is conserved.
245750	258290	30	A	1.0	And we saw that the approach to perfect alignment between the two agents, or perfect prediction on the part of the two agents, becomes more challenging.
258370	261590	31	A	1.0	Not surprisingly, as system complexity increases.
262330	269180	32	A	0.99998	So the more complex the communication, the harder it is to predict, as one would expect.
270910	282240	33	A	0.99999	In the last session, we talked about how constraints on thermodynamic free energy induce compartmentalization in agents.
283250	299810	34	A	0.99994	So whenever agents interact with their environments in fairly complex ways, then they end up being compartmentalized into compartments that have to communicate classically.
300310	304986	35	A	1.0	And this is solely a result of quantum information theory.
305038	314562	36	A	0.99987	You don't have to assume any biology to get this compartmentalization, but clearly, this is something that we see in biological systems.
314626	330250	37	A	0.99999	Not only do we see compartments, we also see hierarchical control, which is likewise a sort of automatic outcome of the theory for complex systems.
330850	349620	38	A	0.98	And finally, last time, we talked a little bit about how these compartments communicate and introduce the idea of communication protocols that involve local operations on a shared quantum resource of some kind.
349990	351918	39	A	0.95	And classical communication.
352014	366754	40	A	0.99963	We talked to Fairman about how classicality communication is a little bit problematic to define in quantum theory, because, of course, you're introducing classicality.
366802	372730	41	A	1.0	And so you have to make some very specific assumptions about what's classical.
373470	386270	42	A	1.0	And we'll see later on today what the key assumption that gives you classicality is, as we talk about Spacetime.
387730	395220	43	A	0.99982	But before I go into the topic of Spacetime, I want to spend a little time.
397110	399300	44	A	1.0	Okay, sorry.
399750	400962	45	A	0.99999	This is where we're going.
401016	406360	46	A	0.91344	We're talking about Spacetime, and we'll talk about applications to biology next time.
407050	413030	47	A	0.99733	But before we get going on this, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about explanation.
413930	427100	48	A	1.0	And this is motivated by a question that came up, a very long question that touched on many different topics that came up in the interactive Q A last time.
428990	450450	49	A	0.94	And a fair amount of that question had to do with, directly or indirectly, the question of what scale free explanation looks like and how it compares to scientific explanation in general, most of which is reductive.
451590	469514	50	A	0.99991	So I want to make a short detour into the question of how reductionist theories, which all of you are probably very familiar with, relate to scale free theories, and particularly the free.
469552	470874	51	A	1.0	Free, free energy principle.
470912	472490	52	A	0.99709	Scale free theory.
473070	484240	53	A	0.99981	So it's a theory that's unlike most of the theories that most of you probably learned about in college.
485090	500994	54	A	0.99927	So we're all familiar with reductionist theories and the reductionist idea of scientific explanation, which is really an outcome of philosophy of science in the.
501032	510280	55	A	1.0	People like Rudolph Carnap were among the first to actually make precise what this idea of reductive explanation is.
511050	531920	56	A	0.99987	But the basic idea is that the laws or the dynamics or the formalism that describes behavior at some microscale, the behavior of little things actually explains the behavior of big things.
532610	541680	57	A	0.99989	So the basic reductionist idea is that what the little things are doing is what's important.
542710	551422	58	A	1.0	And what big things are doing are either emergent phenomena, or they're just epiphenomena.
551566	553890	59	A	0.72264	They're essentially just appearances.
555050	558898	60	A	1.0	And this defines a fundamental scale.
559074	574998	61	A	0.99996	So the real assumption in any reductionist theory is that there's some fundamental scale at which the real dynamics takes place and everything else is just an appearance, or it's some sort of emergent phenomenon.
575174	584874	62	A	0.99	And I try to be very careful when I use the word emergence because it's one of the most ambiguous words in the philosophy of science.
584922	587680	63	A	1.0	And people use it to mean all sorts of different things.
590050	599380	64	A	0.83394	But whenever you say emergent, it always sort of implies the idea that it's emergent from something.
600310	617350	65	A	0.72	And so the idea of emergence is essentially a reductionist idea because it at least implicitly assumes that there's some microscale from which the macro scale is emergent.
618430	630460	66	A	0.96	And so discussions of emergent phenomena are often very consistent with reductionism, even if they claim not to be.
631570	638670	67	A	0.85	And we're all taught that science is reductionist.
639250	644930	68	A	1.0	And there are certainly people who publicly claim that science is reductionist.
645750	650340	69	A	0.99987	Richard Dawkins is certainly a shining example of this.
651430	679740	70	A	0.99735	But I suspect that a lot of scientists just kind of play lip service to reductionism without really believing in it, because they don't really believe that the macroscopic phenomena that they are studying, life, for example, is completely determined by what's going on at the microscale, or what's going on at the microscale, plus some stochastic noise or something like that.
680450	686910	71	A	0.70654	So I want to explicitly contrast this with a scalefree theory.
687730	696050	72	A	0.39362	In a scale free theory is not simply a holistic theory, it's much more precise.
696390	709590	73	A	0.88649	In a scale free theory, little things and big things obey the same laws, or they have the same dynamics, or they're described by the same formalism.
710330	715110	74	A	0.99995	So it's not that the macro scale is emergent from the microscale.
715770	720410	75	A	1.0	The macro scale and the microscale actually obey the same laws.
721470	730250	76	A	1.0	And the relationship between macro and micro is probably best stated as one of implementation.
732350	740480	77	A	0.99639	Macro scale things have microscale components, and those microscale components are doing something or other.
740930	749410	78	A	1.0	And whatever they're doing implements the macroscale system and its behavior.
750950	761960	79	A	0.99999	But this implementation is not an explanation, or at least it's not an explanation all by itself.
762730	766866	80	A	1.0	And the bumper sticker version of scale free theories is just as above.
766898	774646	81	A	0.7202	So below whatever laws you have at the macro scale, are the ones, the same ones you have at The Microscale, and Vice Versa.
774838	777498	82	A	0.99972	So, scale free Theories, in a sense, are simple.
777584	781470	83	A	0.98379	It's the same Theory at every level of Description.
783330	791520	84	A	0.99991	So what is this idea of scale, and how does it Relate to what we've talked about in this Course?
792450	799090	85	A	0.99986	Well, what we've talked about in this Course all has to Do With what an Agent Can Observe on its Boundary.
799590	810360	86	A	0.99997	So scale has to Do With How Information Is Encoded on the boundary, and we can Describe that scale in many different Ways.
811770	821340	87	A	0.68047	Here's A Commonplace Way to Describe it in Physics by A Relationship between energy and distance, or size.
822590	828250	88	A	0.92	And you've probably all heard of the Planck scale.
828910	833840	89	A	1.0	The Planck scale is the smallest scale at which current Physics Makes any sense.
836930	847650	90	A	1.0	And in energetic terms, it's defined by energies on the order of Ten to the 19th GEV, which is GiGAelectron volt.
849750	858738	91	A	1.0	The LHC, the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, gets to about ten to the Fourth GEV.
858834	863190	92	A	0.99927	So many, many orders of magnitude less than the Planck scale.
863930	870170	93	A	0.99996	So the Planck scale is extremely energetic compared to what we can probe Experimentally.
871710	884110	94	A	1.0	The Planck scale energy of ten to the 9th GEV corresponds to a distance of about ten to the -35 meters, which is incredibly tiny.
885410	890970	95	A	0.73817	An intermediate scale on this diagram is about the scale of a nucleon.
891050	901410	96	A	0.99995	So, for example, a proton or a neutron, they have a rest mass of about one GeV and a size of about one femtometer.
901830	906550	97	A	0.99976	So this intermediate scale is roughly the scale of nucleon physics.
907930	927066	98	A	1.0	And then if you go to our scale, the scale of things that are about a meter in size, Human beings, Tables and chairs, lots of animals, the Things we're most Familiar with, that corresponds to an incredibly tiny energy.
927168	941230	99	A	1.0	Ten to the -5 EV is about the energy of a photon of radio Radiation, and a meter is about the Wavelength of long wave Radio.
941970	951966	100	A	0.99962	So if you think about Visible light, has a Wavelength of about ten to the -5 meters, an energy of about an electron volt.
952078	967670	101	A	1.0	So it's not Surprising that visible light feels energetic to Us because it's Orders of magnitude above our Natural scale of energy of this Sort of thermal environment in which we exist.
968990	984640	102	A	0.87306	So it's the encoding scale and the boundary that is going to relate theories of things that we see to each other.
985490	988874	103	A	0.99	And this ends up giving a kind of complicated picture.
988922	994770	104	A	0.99916	If you think of Alice interacting with Bob and measuring things on the boundary.
999890	1001790	105	A	0.99931	Sorry, I'm a little bit ahead of myself.
1001940	1004954	106	A	1.0	I just wanted to show you a picture of a reductive theory.
1005002	1005994	107	A	0.99999	This is the Big Bang.
1006042	1007700	108	A	0.99726	You're all familiar with this.
1008070	1017220	109	A	0.99991	Something happens at the Planck scale, and the entire universe results from it by just a scale change.
1017670	1020626	110	A	0.98522	So this is a reductive theory.
1020818	1023830	111	A	0.7	A scale free theory is much more complicated.
1024650	1027720	112	A	0.99702	So here's what a scale free theory looks like.
1029050	1037962	113	A	0.99378	Alice interacts with Bob, and she's looking at her boundary, and her boundary states.
1038096	1042170	114	A	1.0	The boundary states she sees could be encoded at different scales.
1043070	1048080	115	A	0.99719	So there may be a small scale scale one and a bigger scale scale two.
1049330	1059200	116	A	0.98	And what Alice is looking for is some sort of theory that relates the first scale, the microscale, to the.
1062930	1069540	117	A	0.77358	So it's not that the microscale came first like it did in the Big Bang, and the macro scale came later.
1071770	1075430	118	A	0.52092	These are encodings that can be happening simultaneously.
1076090	1083494	119	A	1.0	And the theoretical task is to find theories that relate between these scales.
1083542	1091020	120	A	0.99	And these are implementation theories, or you might call them embedding theories from one scale into another.
1092110	1099982	121	A	0.95	And what we want as a consistency criterion is for these theories to be constant in time.
1100036	1102400	122	A	0.98964	So as Bob evolves in time.
1103170	1107726	123	A	0.99	And so what Alice sees are these encodings on her boundary.
1107918	1117220	124	A	0.99998	She wants the relationship between encodings at different scales to stay constant, because if it doesn't, she'll never be able to figure anything out.
1118870	1125960	125	A	0.99996	She'll just have this chaotic relationship between things happening at different scales, and nothing will make sense.
1127690	1133130	126	A	0.99994	So you have this complicated picture in scale free theories.
1133470	1154510	127	A	0.67	And if you look at this and it seems vaguely familiar, or even vaguely even very familiar, then it should, because this is exactly the kind of explanatory structure or semantic structure that you have in computer science.
1156050	1170390	128	A	0.99998	If you're studying the behavior of a computer, which is just some piece of hardware, some physical system, then you can describe what that piece of hardware is doing at different scales.
1170970	1187878	129	A	1.0	And in fact, what we call the hardware level of description when we talk about our laptops, for example, is typically the level of description of circuits, of transistors inside microprocessors.
1187974	1190010	130	A	0.99976	We think of that as the hardware level.
1190160	1208020	131	A	0.99999	But of course, that's just a description, too, that's layered on top of lots of much smaller scale dynamics, all the way down to the scale of atoms and eventually nuclei and elementary particles and all that other stuff.
1208710	1217250	132	A	0.9998	So there's some quantum stuff that's going on that we describe as having a classical hardware level of bit exchange.
1218550	1223320	133	A	1.0	And then we describe the behavior of programs on top of that.
1224650	1240134	134	A	0.99971	So what we want, what makes a computer useful is that we can assign semantics to programs, and we can talk about semantic relationships between programs.
1240182	1258900	135	A	0.99998	For example, the relationship between the Internet protocol stuff that Zoom is doing and what you actually see on your user interface and hear on your user interface that needs to stay fixed over time.
1259270	1268020	136	A	0.99969	Or Zoom becomes incomprehensible and not programmable and in fact, not even well defined as an algorithmic system.
1268470	1277080	137	A	1.0	And the same is true for the relationship between the operating system and the hardware description, or between the operating system and zoom as a program.
1277850	1284666	138	A	0.97207	So computer science works in exactly this scale free way.
1284848	1291462	139	A	0.99	And so, in a sense, scale free explanation is very familiar.
1291526	1296618	140	A	0.94171	It's exactly the kind of explanation that we have in computer science.
1296794	1310850	141	A	1.0	And that's why I referred to the relationship between scales as one of implementation, because that's a term that we're familiar with from thinking about computers implementing programs.
1311910	1314046	142	A	0.99991	So what are these theories?
1314238	1339210	143	A	0.99997	If we think in biological terms, we can think of pathways being embedded in a cell, or cells being embedded in tissues, all the way up to niches of various Kinds, which may be social niches being embedded in ecosystems, and ecosystems being embedded in the biosphere.
1339550	1348670	144	A	1.0	And so we have all of these essentially semantic theories that talk about how one scale embeds in another scale.
1349650	1376310	145	A	1.0	And if we have these sorts of scale transitions, we can think of representing the relationship between transitions at different scales in terms of the activity of some kind of renormalization group, which is transforming entities and processes at one scale into entities and processes at another scale.
1377210	1403470	146	A	0.67	And I think in ontology, we can at least put forward the hypothesis that all the way from pathways embedding in cells to ecosystems embedding in the biosphere, we could put forward the hypothesis, at least, that the renormalization group flow across all of these scales is trivial.
1404290	1428146	147	A	0.87359	That is that the embedding theories all have the same formal structure, that the structure that describes how pathways embed into cells is the same structure that describes how ecosystems embed into the biosphere.
1428338	1431080	148	A	1.0	Now, I certainly can't prove that.
1432670	1434650	149	A	1.0	I believe that it's likely.
1435550	1439370	150	A	0.99998	So I think it's an interesting hypothesis to investigate.
1440190	1450240	151	A	1.0	And this is an hypothesis that I want to leave you with as a result of this class is something to think about.
1451650	1461940	152	A	1.0	To what extent, in thinking about biological systems or even social systems, are the embedding theories the same?
1463830	1496378	153	A	0.99432	So, in thinking this way, that the physics of the situation has the same formal structure as computer science has in terms of explanation, we're of course, faced with a problem, which is that we're not just reconstructing physics, we're talking about the physics of interacting observers.
1496474	1498830	154	A	0.99897	We're talking about the physics of communication.
1499570	1503710	155	A	0.96442	So we're modeling how we do physics.
1504770	1507970	156	A	1.0	And that makes our theory self referential.
1508870	1521320	157	A	1.0	And so we have to face the music from Goethel's theorem, which tells us essentially that powerful self referential theories can't be both consistent and complete.
1521850	1526690	158	A	1.0	And by powerful I just mean powerful enough to express arithmetic.
1526770	1528630	159	A	0.99998	So not terribly powerful.
1529770	1535100	160	A	0.99854	So this becomes an issue that we have to live with.
1537630	1554478	161	A	0.99994	We will always be faced with this issue of having to construct meta theories which tell us how our lower level theories work, but we never get to the end of that process.
1554644	1566820	162	A	0.99722	We never can get to theories that are both consistent and complete, because our tower of theories becomes progressively, actually more powerful as it goes.
1568150	1590860	163	A	0.92887	So Goethel, in a sense, poses a problem, but in another sense just tells us what life is like as a scientist, that you can't have everything all the time doing science, but we probably all already knew that.
1591310	1613700	164	A	0.99991	So let's now talk about space, end of digression, and see how these ideas apply to a system or a tower of systems that can construct a spatial embedding in its world, in its observed world.
1614390	1626760	165	A	0.9999	So let's start out thinking about a system that can see its environment, but what it sees is a completely uniform environment where nothing is happening.
1628730	1639180	166	A	0.80669	So if you have a uniform environment where nothing is happening, you can't distinguish one part of the environment from another from another.
1640910	1642860	167	A	1.0	You have no sense of space.
1644530	1662402	168	A	0.72648	So what I want to do is build up from scratch what's needed to have a sense of space, and then we'll talk a little bit about what organisms are doing.
1662456	1685820	169	A	1.0	And I think a very interesting question is, if you look at phylogeny, at what points in phylogeny, what lineages in phylogeny actually need to have a sense of space, and what do they have to have in terms of computational power to have that sense of space?
1687070	1692140	170	A	0.99991	So if you just have a uniform environment, you don't have a sense of space.
1693950	1705550	171	A	0.99984	But the first thing we can do with an environment is to divide it up into some number of parts that are somehow distinguishable.
1706710	1711810	172	A	0.72385	So suppose we can segment the environment into two different parts.
1712470	1714066	173	A	0.99	And if you think about E.
1714088	1716786	174	A	0.99842	Coli, for example, E.
1716808	1729270	175	A	0.99887	Coli has a bunch of sensors on the front and a bunch of effectors on the back, so it can sense much more about the front part of the environment than the back part of the environment.
1729850	1731206	176	A	0.99875	So already with E.
1731228	1740982	177	A	0.52319	Coli, you have this kind of segmentation of the environment into parts, but so far, nothing is happening in this environment.
1741046	1744090	178	A	1.0	We just have segments that can be distinguished.
1745810	1754670	179	A	0.6293	So let's consider an environment like this, that has distinguishable segments.
1757270	1764020	180	A	0.49168	What one next wants to know about these segments is whether they're next to each other.
1765190	1778040	181	A	1.0	And if we just have a bunch of segments, we just have a set, and a set doesn't have any order or any relationship information.
1779530	1788570	182	A	0.78319	So I've drawn this environment as a rectangle of rectangles, but that's just a representation.
1791470	1798830	183	A	1.0	And it looks like there are relationships between these rectangles, but if they're just a set, then there are no relationships.
1799330	1803790	184	A	0.99994	If we want to add relationships, then we have to add them explicitly.
1804690	1834250	185	A	0.99994	So let's add some connections between these different segments of the environment to turn that set into a graph that says explicitly, for example, that the light green segment is attached to the light blue segment, and it's also attached to the dark green segment, and the dark blue segment is attached to the light blue segment and attached to the dark green segment.
1834670	1839722	186	A	0.99994	So now we have something that's much more mathematically complicated than a set.
1839776	1842842	187	A	0.99999	We have a graph that has some connection information.
1842976	1845070	188	A	0.99995	So we have a connection topological.
1846850	1850110	189	A	1.0	Now, adding this topology does something very important.
1850180	1855870	190	A	0.97	It breaks the exchange symmetry that is there if you just have a set.
1856020	1871110	191	A	0.99987	So if we just have a set, it doesn't make any difference if I exchange, for example, the positions of the upper right light blue segment with the upper left light green segment.
1871610	1876120	192	A	0.9999	But if we have this connection topology, then it does make a difference.
1876810	1888330	193	A	0.87	Right, I've twisted the graph around, and if I have to break connections to exchange things, then I've actually changed the topology.
1889550	1900990	194	A	0.99923	So adding a topology, adding connections, can disrupt a symmetry that's there if there is no topology.
1902930	1910100	195	A	0.99984	So now let's think about, now we have the structure that's required to think about something happening.
1911430	1923974	196	A	0.99977	So suppose that at some time, as measured in the bit counter time reference frame of the observing system, something happens.
1924092	1927190	197	A	0.99994	So a dot appears in the light green segment.
1928570	1933814	198	A	1.0	And we can express this actually in the notation of quantum field theory.
1933862	1947200	199	A	0.99997	We can think of the light green segment as a field and the dot appearing is the occurrence of an excitation in that field.
1948210	1959570	200	A	1.0	And so we can write this notation that says that the green field was excited to produce a dot which is up arrow Green dot.
1962150	1976040	201	A	1.0	And sometime after that it may turn out that the dot disappears in the green field and some sort of dot appears down in the dark blue field.
1976890	1985450	202	A	1.0	And again, we can write this in this kind of creation and destruction operator notation that one has in quantum field theory.
1986190	1994090	203	A	1.0	And so this says that the green field is no longer excited, but now the dark blue field is excited.
1995090	2000270	204	A	0.99813	So this doesn't imply anything about these excitations being the same.
2000340	2002320	205	A	0.99999	In fact, they're completely different.
2003010	2007860	206	A	0.73	One is an excitation of the green field and one is an excitation of the blue field.
2008230	2011650	207	A	0.99985	But at least now something is happening in the environment.
2012150	2022882	208	A	0.99574	So we can think about what does it take for an observer to notice that something is happening in its environment?
2022946	2042890	209	A	1.0	It has to be able to detect a change occurring in some segment of its environment, and that change can involve something happening or something stopping happening in that segment of its environment.
2043390	2049680	210	A	0.99976	But it doesn't yet have to have any idea of what an object is.
2050690	2071310	211	A	0.78014	But we can add that if the system has a memory, we can have the system connect these events happening in different parts of its environment.
2072070	2082610	212	A	0.99996	So if the system has a memory that has some number of steps, I'll say n steps, but here it could even just be two steps.
2084890	2103526	213	A	0.99	It can see transitions between these two different states, where there's a dot in the green field and then a dot in the dark blue field, and then a dot in the green field, and then a dot in the dark blue field, and then a dot in the green field, et cetera.
2103718	2112080	214	A	0.99994	So I've expressed this in this sort of field theory notation over on the right side.
2112690	2115418	215	A	1.0	And what this is is a flip flop.
2115594	2118430	216	A	0.9999	It's an observed periodic behavior.
2119410	2124610	217	A	0.99969	So this is the basic idea behind a clock.
2124950	2138914	218	A	0.67378	So any observer that can see this number of time steps internally can interpret what's going on in its external environment.
2139042	2140710	219	A	0.99999	As a clock ticking.
2141690	2143910	220	A	0.79	It can see some aperiodic.
2145130	2155782	221	A	0.99942	So as long as you can have memory and the ability to detect change, you can see periodic behavior in the environment.
2155926	2159470	222	A	0.99999	So you can see the environment acting like a clock.
2161970	2168110	223	A	0.99969	So let's think a bit about what this does and does not require.
2168450	2177802	224	A	0.9999	So, seeing a clock in the environment requires having distinguishable, non exchangeable sectors of the environment.
2177866	2183390	225	A	0.99999	So you have to have this connection topology that breaks the exchange symmetry.
2183770	2189154	226	A	0.83	It requires having these sectors implement some sort of flip flop.
2189282	2202890	227	A	0.99995	So something aperiodic happening, and you have to have enough memory to see that periodicity, but it doesn't require any sense of object identity.
2203870	2213600	228	A	0.99984	So the excitation in the green part and the excitation in the blue part can still just be field excitations of the green part and the blue part.
2216770	2219742	229	A	0.75772	There's nothing that says that those have to be the same thing.
2219796	2223860	230	A	0.99999	They just have to appear and disappear in some periodic way.
2224790	2228580	231	A	1.0	And having clock doesn't require a metric space.
2228950	2233730	232	A	0.99999	You don't need to have any sense of distance defined on the environment.
2234410	2239750	233	A	0.99966	You just have to have this segmentation that is not rearrangeable.
2240250	2247340	234	A	0.99996	So this tells us something extremely important, which is that time is more fundamental than space.
2248030	2256570	235	A	0.68471	Time in the exterior environment is much simpler and easier to observe than space in the exterior environment.
2256910	2274130	236	A	0.99998	So if we're thinking biologically about phylogeny, we might expect to see organisms that can detect periodic behavior in the external environment long before they can detect spatial organization in the exterior environment.
2274470	2282530	237	A	0.76	And we know that organisms, even down to microbial mats, can respond to the diurnal cycle.
2283370	2302540	238	A	0.99672	So we know that organisms, in a sense, can detect environmental clocks, even organisms that we have no reason to believe, divide the environment up into spaces or the sort of space that we're used to, like a Euclidean space.
2303950	2310590	239	A	0.98533	So adding space to this Idea of time in the Environment.
2313090	2333890	240	A	0.51652	So the Next step is to be able to see motion and being Able to see one thing move from one segment of the Environment to another segment, as opposed to something happening in One segment, and then something happens in another segment.
2334730	2351338	241	A	1.0	One has to have this idea of object persistence, that there's a thing that has an Identity, and Its identity doesn't change over time, and it doesn't change when you move it someplace else.
2351424	2356460	242	A	0.57806	When it appears someplace else in the Environment, it's the same object.
2358370	2370190	243	A	0.99517	So this is an idea that psychologists call object persistence, and it's an idea that physicists call translational invariance.
2370950	2375314	244	A	0.90749	Translational invariance means two things.
2375512	2382098	245	A	1.0	It means that if I have an object and I move it to a different location, I don't change the object.
2382264	2386166	246	A	0.64693	It's the Same object that I move from here to there.
2386348	2389080	247	A	0.69559	So the location doesn't change the object.
2390010	2392854	248	A	0.79	And it also means the reverse of that.
2393052	2396310	249	A	1.0	It means that the object doesn't change the location.
2399310	2404730	250	A	0.99993	My container remains invariant Even though I move the object around in it.
2404880	2412990	251	A	0.99995	So these are kind of the two phases of translational invariance, and they're the two faces of object persistence.
2414690	2424100	252	A	0.99998	As the object moves through time, Its identity remains fixed, and it doesn't Change the time that it's moving through.
2424790	2432610	253	A	0.99995	So if I'm measuring Its Motion With a clock, moving the object doesn't Change the clock.
2434090	2437590	254	A	0.98665	These are clearly very classical ideas.
2439210	2443750	255	A	0.99	And we talked about earlier Classical communication.
2445450	2468880	256	A	0.95	And when we talked about classical communication in, for Example, the context of a Bell EPR experiment, we talked about the observers being able to write down some data on a piece of paper or on a Disk drive or something and hand those Data to someone Else.
2469330	2471774	257	A	0.99269	So this is Translational Invariance.
2471822	2476130	258	A	1.0	The Data Can't Change When Alice Gives it to Bob.
2476550	2480020	259	A	0.98136	Otherwise, there isn't Classical Communication taking Place.
2480950	2485494	260	A	0.99	And of course, there's an up to noise built into here, right?
2485532	2491654	261	A	0.78	The piece of paper might get wet and the ink might run a little bit, but it's still the same message.
2491772	2495430	262	A	0.99655	There's still some identity being assumed.
2496110	2501670	263	A	0.99908	So object persistence is not an idea we get from quantum theory.
2501750	2505850	264	A	0.93832	It's an idea that we impose on top of quantum theory.
2506270	2510190	265	A	1.0	And it's this idea that's intrinsically classical.
2511090	2516170	266	A	0.99999	So we're looking right here at the quantum to classical transition.
2516250	2517360	267	A	0.99999	This is it.
2518370	2522334	268	A	0.99999	This is what gets added to quantum theory to get classical physics.
2522382	2524850	269	A	0.99982	It's this idea of object persistence.
2525830	2539560	270	A	1.0	Now, once we have object persistence, we can kind of go to town constructing space, and here's how we do it.
2542890	2565440	271	A	0.99999	We all learned about object persistence this way when we were six months old, doing motor babbling and observing our hands and feeling how our bodies worked and seeing objects that we could manipulate and that didn't change when we manipulated them.
2566450	2569658	272	A	0.99992	So this is the birth of object persistence.
2569754	2575330	273	A	0.99999	This is the birth of classicality in human psychology.
2579350	2582546	274	A	0.99996	So now let's start thinking about building a coordinate system.
2582648	2583842	275	A	0.99996	What's a coordinate system?
2583896	2589990	276	A	0.95	A coordinate system is just a set of labels that are attached to these segments of the environment.
2590970	2594120	277	A	1.0	And to build a coordinate system, you have to have an origin.
2594970	2602060	278	A	0.85	And an origin means an object, something that's fixed, something that doesn't move around.
2603390	2609510	279	A	1.0	And so a coordinate system requires the ability to identify.
2609590	2622080	280	A	0.87	A stigmergic memory requires the ability to find something in the environment that has a meaning that stays constant over time.
2622550	2625474	281	A	1.0	And that's what a stigmergic memory is.
2625512	2633380	282	A	0.58939	It's something in the environment that provides us with a memory resource that we can count on being the same.
2634650	2665280	283	A	1.0	And it's having this fixed point that allows us to label these connected segments of the environment that contain objects that move and be able to say, okay, the object moved from this part of the Environment to another part, and I can give those parts labels with respect to this other part that doesn't move, this origin point.
2666290	2670910	284	A	1.0	And once I have this, I can construct other invariances.
2671490	2683170	285	A	0.99994	So, for example, I can consider an object that rotates around this origin without changing its identity, and that defines what's called rotational invariance.
2684410	2698006	286	A	1.0	And I can also talk about an object that gets bigger and smaller compared to this fixed point and that defines radial distance.
2698198	2724340	287	A	1.0	And if you think about the baby in the previous slide that's doing motor babbling, it sees things getting smaller as it moves them farther away so the visual system does this computation for us and constructs this radial coordinate for us with respect to our bodies, or specifically our heads, our eyes.
2726070	2744390	288	A	0.99756	So in doing this very early motor activity, we're actually building the spatial coordinate system for our brains that's implemented by the hippocampus, the place cells in the hippocampus.
2745610	2758780	289	A	1.0	And if I have an origin point in the environment, I can also infer that I am moving, that I have changed my location with respect to that object.
2759730	2771162	290	A	1.0	And that's a considerably more complicated inference, because you have to have a representation of the self of you to say, I moved.
2771306	2776562	291	A	0.99991	So this is something that comes after you've developed this spatial coordinate system.
2776696	2785400	292	A	0.99998	You have to be able to locate, in a sense, metacognitively, a particular object that's you in that coordinate system.
2786730	2793638	293	A	0.99988	So we're going to set that aside and now talk about adding some numbers.
2793724	2820830	294	A	0.90728	So, adding a metric, and adding a metric requires another particular kind of object, which is a ruler, a particular fixed object that can be moved around and that has translational invariance, and translational invariance up to some transformation, up to some tensor.
2821730	2825410	295	A	1.0	And in Euclidean space, that tensor is the identity.
2826070	2832530	296	A	0.99956	So in Euclidean space, you have perfect translational and rotational invariance.
2833510	2844120	297	A	0.98891	As you get into general relativity, then the ruler can actually change its length as you rotate, or the ruler can change its length as it moves through space.
2844650	2855530	298	A	0.9996	So effectively, your Spacetime can deform, the coordinates of your Spacetime can deform, and that gives you the representation of mass, of cOurse, in general relativity.
2856750	2868030	299	A	0.99981	So we talked several sessions ago about quantum reference frames, and I used the example of rulers and clocks as quantum reference frames.
2868530	2887110	300	A	0.99975	So now we see how to construct those from observations and symmetry breaking and object identity, all of which we need to define a quantum reference frame out in the environment, like a ruler.
2887930	2898678	301	A	0.99	And notice that we don't need any of that environmental stuff to define those QRFs within our own processing.
2898774	2907194	302	A	0.99	And in fact, the ones that exist within us, we have no direct access to.
2907392	2919280	303	A	0.99997	We can look at someone else's brain and talk about their spatial representation system, but we can't look inside our own brains and talk about our spatial representation system.
2921090	2926820	304	A	0.99989	So this is how we get a metric space from the ground up.
2927990	2950620	305	A	1.0	And we've talked about this from a very psychological or biological point of view, starting from sort of motor capabilities, motor babbling, for example, a measure of effort which gives you some sense of mass.
2951150	2957130	306	A	0.99999	So if it's easy to move something, it's light, and if it's hard to move something, it's heavy.
2958270	2966510	307	A	1.0	And we understand that when we're six months old, because we can measure how much force we're having to apply with our muscles.
2967090	2982370	308	A	0.99998	We have a reference internally for this force that we're applying, and we use that internal measurement to attribute this idea of mass to things in the environment.
2982950	2985490	309	A	0.99969	We have to have memory from manipulations.
2986090	2993830	310	A	0.99985	We have to be able to identify invariances that define objects object persistence.
2994330	3001580	311	A	1.0	And we have to be able to build a ruler that we can move around and use to define a metric space.
3002670	3006460	312	A	0.71	Now, this is very different from the way physicists approach this.
3007790	3012942	313	A	0.99998	If you look at the physics literature, then people start with information transfer.
3013076	3017470	314	A	0.99998	They talk about entanglement as a basic resource.
3019490	3023822	315	A	0.86266	There's a lot of discussion of bulkboundary duality.
3023886	3040178	316	A	0.83	And the most well known one is the duality between antidicitter space, which is the sort of space you see inside a black hole, and conformal field theory, a quantum field theory on the boundary of the black hole.
3040274	3050330	317	A	0.99967	So things you can see, for example, going on, on the horizon of a black hole are dual to the geometry and the interior.
3051630	3059302	318	A	0.99999	By this mathematical Relationship, you can use that mathematical relationship to construct quantum error correcting code.
3059366	3072990	319	A	0.99993	Code by using the symmetries of the field theory as a resource for redundancy that allows you to represent the same thing in different places.
3073730	3081090	320	A	1.0	And as soon as you can do that, you can build up a network of elements that look basically like elements of a lattice.
3081750	3092840	321	A	0.97	And a lattice is a graph to which you can assign symmetric relationships, and you get a metric space.
3093850	3106730	322	A	0.98	And in physics, typically, the goal is to get Einstein's equations out of this to start with some information, theoretic sorts of constructs, and get the equations of general relativity.
3107630	3111534	323	A	0.99486	But what are the equations of general mean?
3111572	3133330	324	A	0.99976	These are things that Einstein derived by doing fairly simple thought experiments, using the invariances of ordinary Euclidean space, combined with ideas from special relativity about the speed of light being constant.
3134230	3151980	325	A	1.0	And he added the principle of equivalence, which is the idea that essentially mass and acceleration are the same thing, or that gravity and acceleration are the same, that weight and acceleration are the same thing.
3153230	3181890	326	A	0.82403	So it's at least reasonable to expect that this inferential process that's going on in theoretical physics is generating the same thing, although in a very formalized way that we can generate by thinking about how organisms deal with their environments.
3182950	3189800	327	A	0.5	And so I want to leave this with you as the second hypothesis here.
3192010	3201610	328	A	1.0	The first one was the hypothesis about a trivial renormalization group flow across scales and biology.
3202830	3211920	329	A	1.0	The second hypothesis is that these two approaches to emergent Spacetime are actually giving us the same information.
3213410	3230450	330	A	1.0	And maybe starting out with the same information, in fact, that we may be able to think about these fundamental building blocks of information flow and entanglement.
3231030	3238120	331	A	0.93187	In terms of the sorts of perceptual relationships that we've been talking about in this class.
3239290	3246520	332	A	0.99892	So there's our second hypothesis to think about going forward.
3247870	3267390	333	A	0.75	And I just want to leave you with the idea that organisms at least manage this very interesting process that we can think of starting as starting with the construct of memory.
3268770	3279730	334	A	0.53193	Organisms have memory at multiple scales, and it's memory that allows them to formulate the idea that there are objects.
3281030	3287670	335	A	1.0	And as soon as you have objects that persist, you have a source of redundancy.
3288330	3290550	336	A	0.99428	So you can do error correction.
3291610	3303690	337	A	1.0	And if you can do error correction, if you can move the same thing from one place to another and have it encode the same information, then you can build Spacetime.
3305150	3310810	338	A	1.0	And as soon as you have Spacetime, you can use the Spacetime as more memory.
3312130	3315514	339	A	1.0	You can use the Spacetime itself, quantum error correcting code.
3315562	3316160	340	A	0.99964	Code.
3317570	3325402	341	A	0.99979	Because Spacetime has the nice ability to hold lots of copies of some informative structures.
3325466	3337058	342	A	0.99981	So you can build libraries, or you can build computers, or you can build the Internet, if you have Spacetime, which gives you more memory, which gives you more object persistence, which gives you more error correction.
3337234	3339494	343	A	1.0	And the circle just spins around.
3339692	3344950	344	A	0.99408	So organisms do this, and the question is, how does it get off the ground?
3345610	3364830	345	A	0.84	And next time, we can at least speculate about that kind of origin of life type of question in the context of the FEP and its realization in simple systems of communicating observers.
3365970	3372080	346	A	0.9962	So, as always, I encourage you to use the interactive Q A.
3373110	3387000	347	A	1.0	The fifth discussion session with Ander, who's unfortunately not here today, will be the last day of September, Saturday at five, as usual, 05:00 European time, 08:00 California time.
3387690	3392150	348	A	1.0	And then the last session of the class will be the twelveth of October.
3392650	3399100	349	A	0.99925	So, thank you very much, and I look forward to your questions in the interactive Q and A.
3404990	3405740	350	A	0.78514	Awesome.
3408630	3409838	351	B	0.99972	Thank you, Chris.
3410014	3411700	352	B	0.99	Can I ask some short questions?
3412550	3413250	353	A	0.99922	Sure.
3413400	3414238	354	B	0.8874	All right.
3414424	3424200	355	B	0.97628	So, first from Lana wrote, is the periodicity, the time lengths between and during the excitations built in.
3424570	3431340	356	B	0.99714	So this was when we had the four cells and there was the inklings of a clock coming into play.
3436760	3459930	357	A	0.04	It I think the simplest answer is that if nothing else is happening in the environment except this periodic behavior, then the.
3462140	3468380	358	A	0.52414	It's not actually meaningful to talk yet about the time between the events.
3469680	3498000	359	A	0.99981	So if I have a system that's quasiperiodic, for example, and nothing else is going on in my environment, then I can't distinguish that from a perfectly periodic system because I would have to have a perfectly periodic reference to know that the other system was apyotic.
3498680	3516360	360	A	1.0	And if you think about the internal clock being driven by information flow into the system, then something has to be happening in the environment for information to be flowing into the system and being counted.
3517200	3527550	361	A	0.95916	So, again, as we talked about a few sessions ago, the internal memory only gets updated when something happens.
3529360	3533250	362	A	0.99873	So internal and external get tied together.
3535540	3550500	363	A	0.99999	This is why we can use external clocks, but it's also why we depend on external clocks, because our intuitive sense of time is very malleable.
3551880	3564570	364	A	0.51	And so we actually, as humans, use external clocks to correct for the malleability of our own intuitive sense of time.
3566780	3567396	365	B	0.99998	Wow.
3567518	3587760	366	B	0.96	And there's probably a lot to be said for that procrustian nature of having the konometer, the clock on the wall, and the tick, tick, tick as an evolutionarily novel ruler of time, playing a logistical role in time bound.
3590020	3596292	367	A	0.52	And think of earlier clocks that earlier cultures have used and that animals use.
3596346	3608136	368	A	0.96	I mean, we have the solar clock, the lunar clock, et cetera, and the orbit of Venus clock that was so important to the Mayans and so on.
3608318	3619740	369	A	0.95349	So there are lots of available clocks in the environment, if you have the ability to notice them and enough memory to realize that they're clocks.
3621440	3622140	370	B	0.99991	Awesome.
3622290	3625192	371	B	0.513	All right, here's a question from Upcycle Club.
3625256	3635040	372	B	0.99504	They wrote, how does representing the network structure and dynamics with quantum embeddings affect the semantic interpretation of the network?
3642810	3648970	373	A	0.72	The the embedding theory is the simplest semantic interpretation of the network.
3650670	3651420	374	A	0.607	So.
3658140	3665980	375	A	1.0	And again, a good way to think of this is through the lens of computer science.
3667600	3680240	376	A	0.53508	As soon as you have a programming language that allows variable binding, then you've built a very simple kind of semantics into the language.
3682500	3705000	377	A	0.56801	If you have X as a variable and you have variable binding, then at different times in the execution of the program, X can have different causal consequences for downstream computation because it's been bound to a different value, so it has different semantics.
3706380	3713500	378	A	0.99551	So the semantics of X, again, go back to Gregory Bateson.
3715920	3723420	379	A	0.97	The basis of semantics is differences that make a difference, make a difference to behavior, make a difference to actionability.
3724820	3732610	380	A	0.99737	So variable binding gives you differences that actually make a difference to what the program does.
3734580	3738310	381	A	0.99952	So what is that?
3739240	3752440	382	A	0.72398	That is the semantics that's assigned by your embedding theory between what the programming language is doing and what the operating system is doing and so forth.
3753500	3782800	383	A	0.99	And I think it's no surprise that the semantics of programming languages end up being represented with these very general mathematical constructs like category theory, which are essentially tools for representing arbitrary relations between systems.
3783940	3786370	384	A	0.51	And that's what embedding theories are.
3787320	3792740	385	A	0.55593	They're theories that state relationships between systems.
3796080	3814660	386	B	0.99997	Awesome, and very provocative to explore on the topological and life and on the Spacetime and matter sides, which are of course, seamlessly integrated through, if only our own experiences.
3815800	3824992	387	A	0.99981	Yeah, this is another place where it's useful to go back to this difference between reductive theories and scale free theories.
3825136	3833476	388	A	0.99991	Scale free theories are all about semantics because they represent the existence of stuff happening at different scales.
3833508	3841820	389	A	1.0	And so they naturally raise the question of what are these relationships, what are these embedding theories?
3842720	3849550	390	A	0.98	And in reductive theories there's a very deep sense in which semantics doesn't matter.
3852580	3866530	391	A	0.99997	If you think that all that's going on that's important is the stuff that's going on at the Planck scale, then you don't need any semantics, right?
3870680	3887284	392	A	0.99991	You see this in late 60s, early 70s, old fashioned AI, where people talk about computation, is purely syntactic.
3887412	3889972	393	A	0.8	And this is a very reductionist view of computation.
3890036	3896300	394	A	0.54	It leaves out the semantics, and without the semantics, the computation is useless.
3896720	3900350	395	A	0.86	It doesn't tell us anything at all unless we can map it to something.
3902260	3921190	396	A	0.71208	So we have this philosophy of science tradition that tells us that semantics is not important, and we end up with tools like the FEP that essentially tell us that semantics is all important.
3923720	3931976	397	A	0.99	And from a biological point of view, the most natural response is, of course, we knew that all the time.
3932078	3933720	398	A	0.65699	That's why we're doing ontology.
3936140	3939630	399	A	0.56149	So all of this ties together.
3940480	3949068	400	B	0.99989	Would you say that FEP says semantics is important, and then what does it say about what semantics are important?
3949154	3952560	401	B	0.99986	Or is that entirely left up to the modeler?
3956380	3963480	402	A	0.99846	Well, it tells you a lot about what's important for the system itself, right?
3963550	3972830	403	A	1.0	The system itself is dealing with its environment and it's trying to increase its predictive power.
3973600	3981904	404	A	0.52097	So it's building a theory of the environment, and that theory is intrinsically semantic, right?
3981942	3986800	405	A	0.97584	It's about the environment and it's actionable.
3988660	4007210	406	A	0.72	The theory is meant to drive action on the environment that will either yield more information or get the environment to behave, to do what I'm predicting it's going to do.
4008780	4018060	407	A	0.77947	So I think the FEP is intrinsically semantic in that sense, that it's about an agent modeling its environment.
4019040	4019596	408	B	0.8	Yes.
4019698	4047492	409	B	1.0	And about the semantics of action, as opposed to a partial or limited semantics of passive inference or semantics of abstraction, which kind of leaves the important link between the agent and the environment through sense making and decision selection basically unaddressed because it's kind of Descartes in the thought experiment in the room.
4047626	4051830	410	B	1.0	And here, when we actually engage with the boundary of the room, that's where we.
4052600	4054120	411	A	0.56969	Yeah, yeah.
4054190	4065700	412	A	1.0	The FEP completely destroys this classical notion of the passive observer, as does quantum theory.
4065860	4068680	413	A	0.99998	There are no passive observers in quantum theory.
4069500	4078040	414	A	0.9797	So this is a construct that we inherited from a classical worldview that is seriously misleading.
4084790	4087986	415	B	0.42	A lot more to say, but that's a great place to end.
4088088	4089170	416	B	0.99972	Thank you, Chris.
4089990	4090498	417	A	0.37885	OK.
4090584	4091566	418	A	0.99924	Thank you, Daniel.
4091678	4092914	419	A	1.0	And thanks to you all.
4093032	4094740	420	A	0.96	And ask questions.
4095110	4095874	421	B	0.99958	See you next time.
4095912	4096222	422	A	0.76953	Cheers.
4096286	4097040	423	A	0.93277	We'll see you next time.
