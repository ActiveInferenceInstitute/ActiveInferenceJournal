4200	27100	00:04	It is September 14, 2023. We are in the course, physics as information processing. Looking forward to this lecture and then a little conversation. Chris, off to you.	It is September 14, 2023 and we are in physics as information processing	Physicysics as Information Processing Lecture
27840	386270	00:27	Today we're going to talk about Spacetime, and particularly about the idea that Spacetime is emergent from information processing. This has now become a very mainstream idea in the quantum information and quantum gravity communities. So that's what today's session is going to be about.	The idea that Spacetime is emergent from information processing has become mainstream	Quantum information and spacetime
387730	781470	06:27	Scale free theory is a theory that's unlike most of the theories that most of you probably learned about in college. In a scale free theory, little things and big things obey the same laws. The relationship between macro and micro is probably best stated as one of implementation.	Scale free theory is a theory that says little things actually explain big things	Scalefree Explanation vs Reductionism
783330	1439370	13:03	Scale has to Do With How Information Is Encoded on the boundary. Relationship between energy and distance, or size. The Planck scale is the smallest scale at which current Physics Makes any sense. The theoretical task is to find theories that relate between these scales.	Scale has to Do With How Information Is Encoded on the Boundary	Scale Free or Scale Free?
1440190	1590860	24:00	To what extent, in thinking about biological systems or even social systems, are the embedding theories the same? We never can get to theories that are both consistent and complete, because our tower of theories becomes progressively, actually more powerful as it goes.	In thinking about biological systems, are embedding theories the same as computer science	Computational Science: The Self-Referential Theory
1591310	2302540	26:31	If you have a uniform environment where nothing is happening, you can't distinguish one part of the environment from another from another. What I want to do is build up from scratch what's needed to have a sense of space. We'll talk a little bit about what organisms are doing.	Systems can construct spatial embedding in its world, in its observed world	Quantum field theory and space
2303950	2785400	38:23	The idea of object persistence is that there's a thing that has an Identity, and Its identity doesn't change over time. This is the birth of classicality in human psychology. Now let's start thinking about building a coordinate system.	Object persistence is an idea that psychologists call object persistence	Quantum and classical Psychology: Object persistence
2786730	3413250	46:26	Adding a metric requires another kind of object, which is a ruler that can be moved around. This gives you the representation of mass, of cOurse, in general relativity. I want to leave you as the second hypothesis here. The second hypothesis is that these two approaches are actually giving us the same information.	Adding a metric requires another object, which is a ruler	General Relativity and the quantum frame of reference
3413400	3622140	56:53	The periodicity is the time lengths between and during the excitations built in. Something has to be happening in the environment for information to be flowing into the system. This is why we can use external clocks, but it's also why we depend on external clocks. Our intuitive sense of time is very malleable.	The internal clock only gets updated when something happens in the environment	External and Internal Timekeeping
3622290	4078040	1:00:22	The embedding theory is the simplest semantic interpretation of the network. The basis of semantics is differences that make a difference to behavior. FEP is intrinsically semantic in that it's about an agent modeling its environment. It tells you a lot about what's important for the system itself.	How does representing the network structure and dynamics with quantum embeddings affect semantics	Quantum Embeddings and Their Semantics
4084790	4097040	1:08:04	A lot more to say, but that's a great place to end. See you next time. Cheers.	A lot more to say, but that's a great place to end	Fooled by Nature
