00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,748
Hello and welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:21,968
It is October 12, 2023, and we are in the final lecture, session six in **Physics as Information Processing** with Chris Fields.

3
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:24,832
{So,}Chris, thank you for this journey.

4
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:32,892
Exciting to get to this final lecture, which will be followed only by the last discussion for this go around.

5
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:34,028
{So}It's really awesome.

6
00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:36,060
And to you for this lecture.

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,192
Thank you, Daniel.

8
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:47,200
And welcome, everyone, to this last session that I'll be doing with a focus on biology.

9
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,936
And just to give a brief review.

10
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:34,028
{So} It's really awesome.

11
00:00:52,118 --> 00:01:07,960
As usual, we've focused in this course on generic quantum systems, by which I mean just any quantum system that has some number of degrees of freedom.

12
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:26,940
And we really haven't made any assumptions about these systems other than the assumption that both interacting partners have sufficient degrees of freedom that they can be considered separable.

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,120
So their boundary is small with respect to the total size of each of the interacting systems.

14
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,212
And I want to emphasize again that the approach we've taken is completely **topological**.

15
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:45,030
So we haven't assumed anything about embedding in space.

16
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,270
And as we've characterized these systems, we focused really on two things.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,760
One, the amount of information that the two systems can exchange.

18
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,956
And that amount is determined by the size of their boundary.

19
00:02:06,068 --> 00:02:12,280
It's determined by this number, n, which is the **Hilbert Space** dimension of the boundary.

20
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:24,000
And as we've discussed now in several of the sessions, we can think of this boundary as a collection of N **qubits** via which the two systems, A and B, communicate.

21
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:41,200
The other feature of the interaction on which we focused is the **reference frames** that are used by the two systems to interact with this set of qubits.

22
00:02:41,280 --> 00:03:07,710
And it's these reference frames that assign the information that flows between A and B, meaning, or functional significance, or actionability, or however you want to refer to the idea that when a system gets some information, it does something useful with it.

23
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,440
So those are very generic kinds of ways of characterizing an interaction.

24
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:26,230
You can think of it as a qualitative characterization, the semantics of the information, and a quantitative characterization, the amount of information.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,910
But other than that, we've left the nature of these systems open.

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:50,700
And this characterization allowed us to reformulate the **free energy principle (FEP)** in quantum information theoretic terms, as the principle that interacting systems behave in a way that will asymptotically align their reference frames.

27
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,380
And we saw that full alignment of reference frames is equivalent to **entanglement**.

28
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:09,404
So the FEP drives systems toward entanglement, which is not surprising, because that's what happens to generic quantum systems.

29
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:14,980
They may start out separable, but if they interact long enough, they'll become entangled.

30
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:23,540
So we've had a discussion that is really very generic.

31
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:37,000
Now, we showed a couple of sessions ago that under these very generic assumptions, we got some interesting outcomes.

32
00:04:37,340 --> 00:05:00,690
And one is that if systems have sufficient degrees of freedom under the action of the FEP, they will be driven toward making a diverse set of measurements of their environment, because they're trying to get information about it so that they can predict what it's going to do.

33
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:11,620
And that as they add ways of making measurements, they'll come up against a noncommutativity of their measurements.

34
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:20,890
And this may be due to intrinsic mathematical facts about their measurements, and it may just be due to their limited supply of free energy.

35
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:35,340
So either way, what this induces is **compartmentalization** and the requirement for internal, classical communication on internal boundaries.

36
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,716
So I just wanted to reemphasize that this is a result of basic physics.

37
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:48,080
And we see compartmentalization, of course, ubiquitously in biology.

38
00:05:49,940 --> 00:06:04,950
But this suggests to us that features of biology that are very familiar actually follow from fairly deep physics, and compartmentalization is one of them.

39
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:25,740
We then talked last time about space and time and the computational requirements on any system that is able to perceive an external clock or perceive an external spatial layout.

40
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,890
And we discussed this from a very kind of developmental psychology point of view.

41
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:54,340
We discussed it using essentially the kinds of terms on the right here, as opposed to the kind of language that's much more technical and mathematical, that's used in physics to derive **spacetime** as **emergent** from information transactions.

42
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:05,400
But we at least hypothesize that both of these are ways of getting to the same sense of emergent spacetime.

43
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:25,040
And one important outcome of this discussion was that systems can perceive external clocks, so external periodic behavior with fewer computational resources, so before they're able to perceive spatial layouts.

44
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,050
And we'll get back to this later.

45
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:43,700
So, organisms and maybe other complex systems, seem to manage a collection of capabilities that are all mutually dependent.

46
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:54,280
So memory depends on having layouts of persistent things that can be distinguished.

47
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,750
So it depends on space, and it certainly depends on time.

48
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,380
Space gives structure to persistent objects.

49
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,960
Memory allows you to identify persistent objects.

50
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:20,480
And objects, in turn, give structure to space by being located in different places.

51
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:39,880
And objects enable the fundamental requirement for memory, which is some form of error correction, so that one has enough redundancy in the memory to check to see whether a memory has been degraded.

52
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:57,820
So, organisms seem to manage a physically very important process, which is the use of spacetime and memory as a basis for cognition.

53
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:07,584
You'll recognize these four functions that are mutually interdependent as underlying complex cognition across the board.

54
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:13,920
And you can't really do complex cognition unless you have these capabilities.

55
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:31,880
So today, we're going to put some of these things together in a discussion of biology and end by looking forward to future directions, not just in biology, but in all of **quantum information theory (QIT)**.

56
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:48,700
So, let's talk about biological systems, living systems, which, of course, includes us, but also includes all other organisms and communities of organisms and so forth, at multiple scales.

57
00:09:50,480 --> 00:10:07,620
And I want to put forward a fairly radical hypothesis that living systems are just generic quantum systems that the FEP has driven to a high level of computational complexity.

58
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,270
So what does this really say?

59
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:47,360
It suggests that living systems are just quantum systems that have enough degrees of freedom and a sufficiently complicated internal dynamics that the FEP, by requiring them to predict what their environment is going to do next, has driven them to make complicated measurements and complicated **inferences** on the basis of those measurements that enable fairly complicated actions on the environment.

60
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:59,940
So **these are systems that you would characterize as computers**, essentially information processing systems, with a high degree of computational capability.

61
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,568
Now, this is clearly as much a philosophical hypothesis as an empirical hypothesis.

62
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:14,170
And that's due in part to the fact that we don't really have a good definition of what a living system is.

63
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,900
We can just point and say, that's a living system, and that thing over there isn't.

64
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,720
But beyond that, we don't have much of a theory.

65
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,100
And, of course, people have worked on a theory of what is life?

66
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,640
For decades, but there's not a lot of agreement.

67
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:42,332
And so this is, in a sense, a definitional kind of hypothesis.

68
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:51,670
And we test such kinds of hypothesis by seeing if they're useful conceptually to help us understand what living systems are doing.

69
00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:04,170
Now, as soon as we put forward something like this, inevitably the question comes up, are living systems really quantum systems, or are they classical in some intrinsic sense?

70
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,260
And this question is really an artifact of two things.

71
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:19,016
One, the continuing association between quantum systems and microscopic systems, which is, of course, traditional.

72
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:23,564
Quantum theory was developed to deal with microscopic phenomena.

73
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:28,524
It was first tested as a theory of microscopic phenomena.

74
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:37,430
And it's only in the past couple of decades that quantum theory is being applied to big things, to cosmology, for example.

75
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:47,156
So there's a long tradition of association between quantum and microscopic.

76
00:12:47,188 --> 00:13:00,396
And living systems are mesoscopic, much bigger than atoms, bigger than molecules, and they're not nearly as big as cosmological systems, so they're somewhere in between.

77
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:12,256
And those systems have traditionally been regarded as classical, and even chemistry, even biochemistry {is} are still taught in a very classical way.

78
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:16,480
So we're not used to thinking of these things as quantum systems.

79
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:33,936
But at least in the approach we've taken in this course, all physical systems are quantum systems, and classical information exists only on boundaries, only on boundaries between systems, and it only describes their interaction.

80
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:45,690
And I want to emphasize, I've said it before, but since this is the last class, I want to say it again, that this is not a universally held view.

81
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,110
It's a view that's becoming more common.

82
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,350
And I think a generation from now it will probably be the dominant view of things.

83
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,232
But it's not fair to say that it's the dominant view now.

84
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:14,820
It's, I think, quite fair to say that it's a view on the rise, especially in the quantum information and quantum gravity communities.

85
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,350
But from a strict empirical perspective, we know a number of things.

86
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,440
We know that accurate molecular dynamics calculations require quantum theory.

87
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:38,680
We know that a lot of biologically important molecular processes use quantum coherence.

88
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,060
We know that things like hydrogen bonding can only be understood using quantum theory.

89
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:56,844
We know that cellular free energy budgets are way too small to support fully classical information processing.

90
00:14:56,892 --> 00:15:13,856
If we think of information processing in terms of what proteins are doing or what other molecules are doing in terms of changing shape, we know that shape changes in proteins and other molecules underlie all cellular information processing.

91
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:22,840
So if we think of them as actually implementing cellular information processing, we have way more information processing than could be funded classically.

92
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,276
And finally, we know that **human cognition exhibits contextuality**.

93
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:32,152
So human cognition uses quantum coherence.

94
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:45,292
It's not a classical causal process in all cases, but this is still a very nascent field, and it's a field with a lot of potential.

95
00:15:45,356 --> 00:16:00,470
And I think again, a generation from now, quantum biology is going to be regarded as a very mainstream endeavor, even though it's something of a small emerging field now.

96
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,470
And I'll just show you one picture in support of this third point.

97
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:25,420
This is a plot of measured free energy usage converted to numbers of bits processed at one kHz for a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

98
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:37,250
All that I could find a few years ago that had good calliometric measurements versus the log of their area, their membrane surface area.

99
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:48,950
And the thing to note here is that these cells are processing classical information at pretty low rates, KHz to gigahertz rates, for 1000 bits at a time.

100
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,430
And we know that a lot more is happening in cells than that.

101
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,930
Cells have many more than 1000 proteins, and those proteins are all moving all the time.

102
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:15,980
And if that motion is processing information, then there's not nearly enough classical, **not nearly enough thermodynamic power to power all of that information processing**.

103
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:28,850
So let's now talk a little bit about life and living systems and what they look like.

104
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,960
Here's a view of living systems from the point of view of genome diversity.

105
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:42,020
This is a few years old, so it's out of date by now, but it tells us a lot qualitatively.

106
00:17:44,120 --> 00:18:02,168
It tells us that almost all genome diversity is microbial, that the sorts of organisms that we're familiar with, medium sized organisms like us, animals and plants, have only a tiny amount of genome diversity.

107
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:05,432
So we think of ourselves as pretty diverse.

108
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:14,624
We think of ourselves as quite different from other animals, from flies or worms or sponges or something like that.

109
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:18,112
But in fact, we're not all that different from them.

110
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:21,644
We share many, many proteins with all of those other organisms.

111
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:25,380
We share the same cellular organization and so forth.

112
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:34,980
We're not, in fact, all that different from plants, and we're much more similar to the fungi than to the plants.

113
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:45,000
So we get a very biased view of genome diversity when we just look at familiar, large types of living systems.

114
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,510
Most genome diversity is buried down there in the microbial world.

115
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,608
This isn't the only way we can look at life as a diverse set of organisms.

116
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:03,440
We can also look at it in terms of a cell lineage.

117
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:17,600
The fact that we're all related at the DNA level tells us that we're all descendants of a common ancestor, which is usually called **LUCA**, the **last universal common ancestor**.

118
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:27,320
And LUCA is generally modeled as being a cell, more or less like a bacterial cell.

119
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:34,484
So fairly simple, with not very many pathways, with maybe a DNA genome.

120
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:43,500
And if LUCA didn't have one, then they arose fairly shortly thereafter, because all organisms that we know of have DNA genomes.

121
00:19:44,640 --> 00:20:04,820
But the point of looking at life as a lineage is that we get a diagram that looks very much like the cell lineage from an embryological situation, much like the cell lineage of our own bodies growing from a fertilized egg.

122
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:31,100
And in particular, looking at life as a lineage shows us that not only do we share DNA with all other organisms, we actually share a membrane cytoplasm that's continuous in time all the way back to Leuka, and so continuous in time between us and bacteria.

123
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:48,480
So if you look at life this way, you realize that life is, in a sense, all one organism, all one connected structure that's developed over time through division, cell division.

124
00:20:49,140 --> 00:21:01,732
And so we are very closely related to all other parts of life in the same way that different cells in our bodies are closely related to each other.

125
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:03,332
The time span is just longer.

126
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:11,400
I mean, here the time span is three and a half or four billion years between us and LUCA.

127
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,524
These lineages have been diverging for that long, but they're still continuous.

128
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:23,420
And in particular, they form a continuous cell membrane.

129
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:35,250
So when you think of life in this way, we realize that we are reasoning from just one example when we think about terrestrial life.

130
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:50,740
And this strongly limits what we can say about living systems, what we can say about biology, that we really only have one example, the lineage that descends from LUCA here on Earth.

131
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,488
And at some point, we may have more examples.

132
00:21:53,584 --> 00:22:06,650
And there's certainly groups working on artificial organisms that aren't part of this lineage, that are constructed from parts derived from this lineage, but aren't members of this lineage themselves.

133
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,270
And that may tell us something new about life.

134
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:26,080
But if we think of life this way, we see something very important, which is that as life grows, its boundary gets bigger.

135
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:48,440
And since the boundary of a system constitutes its informational environment, its dimension getting bigger means that more information flows into it from its environment and more information flows out of it into its environment.

136
00:22:49,180 --> 00:23:00,700
So as life develops from LUCA, it gets a larger and larger informational environment, and this dimension of its boundary grows and grows.

137
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:13,680
Now, what that means, if you go back to our original picture of two interacting systems, is that the dimensionality of the physical environment is decreasing.

138
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,688
And we think of the physical environment as increasing in size.

139
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:21,248
We have the expanding universe and all that.

140
00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:23,970
But what's increasing in size is space.

141
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:33,632
And if space is emergent, then that increase is not a real increase in degrees of freedom.

142
00:23:33,776 --> 00:23:42,490
What we're really interested in is the Hilbert Space of the physical environment, as distinct from the Hilbert Space of life.

143
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:50,972
And as life gets bigger, it literally, quite literally eats the physical environment and turns it into more life.

144
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:53,710
So there's less physical environment around.

145
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,048
So the trajectory of life is toward a bigger informational environment and a smaller physical environment.

146
00:24:01,224 --> 00:24:06,556
And as the physical environment gets smaller, you might imagine it gets easier to predict.

147
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:15,300
And as the informational environment gets bigger, you have more information with which to predict the behavior of the physical environment.

148
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,780
So this all hangs together very nicely with the free energy principle.

149
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,350
Here's another picture of this same thing.

150
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:34,490
If we start with some boundary here on the left labeled B, around some system labeled S, and it's embedded in an environment, E.

151
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:55,810
Then as S makes copies of itself through some process like cell division, then it starts to fill up more of E, it's actually converting degrees of freedom of E into degrees of freedom of its copies that it's made of itself.

152
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:04,320
And if we think of some larger boundary drawn somewhere in E, here on the right side, I've labeled that B prime.

153
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:15,140
What happens is that B prime gets slowly filled up with copies of S, and it starts to look like a large organism.

154
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,428
And that's what life is doing in the physical environment.

155
00:25:19,524 --> 00:25:27,560
It's making a bigger boundary for itself at the expense of degrees of freedom of its physical environment.

156
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,790
So we can ask, what drives this process?

157
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,364
Why is life doing this?

158
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:36,670
Why is it making copies of itself?

159
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,850
And the answer to that question, at least one answer to that question, is the free energy principle drives it to do this.

160
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:56,660
And I'll just show you some simulations from several years ago of a cell population.

161
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:11,432
In this upper left panel, the green cells are stem cells that divide, and they've been embedded in an environment that's safe on the left side and 100% lethal on the right side.

162
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:20,830
So they're embedded in an environment that's conducive to life on one side and very dangerous as you get toward the middle.

163
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:44,056
And the purpose of these simulations was to study what happens when the stem cells are able to divide and create not just other stem cells, but create specialized progeny that don't divide.

164
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:57,400
So **somatic progeny** that don't divide and hence have free energy resources, thermodynamic resources, that they can devote to doing something other than dividing.

165
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,330
Cell division is incredibly expensive when it comes to energy.

166
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:16,712
So if you take that energy and apply it not to cell division, but to protecting the stem cells, you can allow the stem cell population to expand.

167
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:19,548
And that's what these other simulations show.

168
00:27:19,634 --> 00:27:26,240
The blue cells are somatic cells that have {very} varying ability to protect the stem cells.

169
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:44,340
And if they're fairly good at protection and they're fairly hard to kill, down in the right bottom quadrant, you can actually get a population expanding well into the highly lethal part of the environment.

170
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,560
So this shows you the FEP in action.

171
00:27:51,500 --> 00:28:14,428
What the stem cells are doing is constructing a very predictable neighborhood around themselves in the environment by dividing to make progeny that don't themselves divide, that just sit there and help protect the stem cells.

172
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:27,940
So the stem cells are now living in a safer, more predictable environment, and that allows them to invade more and more of their physical environment by having this fairly benign, informational environment.

173
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:36,340
So this is the FEP in action driving the expansion of life at the expense of the physical environment.

174
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:52,750
So that lets us go back to this question that was raised last time about the mechanism of these **scale transitions** that we see ubiquitously in life.

175
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:11,248
Life gets bigger and bigger as time goes on phytogenetically, and as time goes on developmentally, we start with some molecular pathways that somehow get assembled into a cell.

176
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:14,370
That's the origin of life question, how does that happen?

177
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:24,980
And about 2 billion years later, cells start to group together to make multicellular organisms.

178
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,800
Now, bacteria group together to make facultative multicellular systems like microbial maps.

179
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,210
3 billion years ago, very, very early on.

180
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:48,030
But we don't see the emergence of obligate multicellulars until much, much later, before the Cambrian explosion, but still less than a billion years ago.

181
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,290
And from there, things get more complicated very quickly.

182
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,880
So one has large multicellular organisms.

183
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:13,700
They develop complicated social relations that probably first emerged with social insects, but are certainly well developed in invertebrates, including in mammals.

184
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:24,360
Organisms group together in very complex ecosystems.

185
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:35,800
And recall here that it's now known that **all multicellular organisms have obligate microbial symbiotes**.

186
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:43,788
So all of our bodies are, in fact, very complex ecosystems populated by many, many different species of bacteria.

187
00:30:43,964 --> 00:30:50,450
And that's true not just for us, but for trees and insects and worms and sponges and everything else.

188
00:30:51,220 --> 00:31:02,012
So **organisms, from a body point of view, are themselves ecosystems**.

189
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:13,376
And organisms organize themselves into ecosystems, and these ecosystems come into contact across the entire biosphere.

190
00:31:13,568 --> 00:31:24,840
So processes as simple as the wind disperse organisms as small as bacteria all over the planet.

191
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:40,030
So this scaling of life toward larger and larger organizational structures is, in a sense, the major thing for biology to explain.

192
00:31:41,360 --> 00:32:03,010
And the hypothesis that we floated last time was that this transition from very small scales to very large scales uses the same mechanism over and over again, or a mechanism that has the same structure over and over again.

193
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,156
So the renormalization group is trivial.

194
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:15,130
Basically, it's just the identity operating at different scales or mapping from one scale to the next.

195
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,770
So the question is, can we approach this in any way?

196
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,770
Does this make sense

197
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:38,160
And to try to make sense of it, we can go to the one developed theory that we have in biology, which has been formulated by Dawkins and others as universal Darwinism.

198
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:48,480
This is just kind of an abstraction of the modern synthesis between Darwinian evolution and genetics.

199
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,948
But universal Darwinism is incredibly simple and very obvious.

200
00:32:55,034 --> 00:33:01,480
It says if you have systems and they can copy each other, they can copy themselves, and the copies can diversify.

201
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:24,140
Then if you want to know what's going to happen at the population level, what you will find is the systems that copy themselves and diversify most efficiently will win because there'll be more of them, so they end up dominating the population, and winning gets called natural selection.

202
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,112
But natural selection is not an extra part of the Darwinian process.

203
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:42,100
It's just the outcome of efficiency of the systems that copy themselves most efficiently, coming to dominate any population.

204
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:52,040
So there's no sort of kind of hand of god or whatever, reaching down and selecting some organisms and not others.

205
00:33:52,110 --> 00:34:12,030
And of course, when Darwin put the idea of natural selection together, he was thinking very explicitly of the analogy of a gardener or a farmer selecting the crops or the animals or whatever that the gardener liked best, and keeping those.

206
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,084
And that's where this selection metaphor comes from.

207
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:21,484
But there's no real process of selection in evolution by natural selection.

208
00:34:21,532 --> 00:34:24,000
It's just copying and diversifying.

209
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:42,410
But this clearly is just the outline of what a real mechanistic theory would be, because we need to have a story about what copying is and what diversifying is and what efficiently means.

210
00:34:44,620 --> 00:35:01,260
And in particular, to address the question that we raised a couple of slides ago, we need to know whether these mechanisms are the same, or at least isomorphic, of the same form at different scales.

211
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,810
So that's what I want to talk about for the next little bit.

212
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,980
Let's start with copying.

213
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:31,296
Up until the 70s, copying in biology really meant DNA replication and, to some extent, cell division.

214
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:35,560
But the focus in evolutionary theory was on DNA replication.

215
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:47,020
And in the 70s, it was realized that whole genes could be duplicated, so whole genes could be copied.

216
00:35:48,480 --> 00:36:09,680
And then shortly after that, it was realized that particularly in prokaryotes, where genes - functionally related genes are next to each other in chromosomes - often in what are called operons, that operons could be duplicated and so entire pathways could be duplicated.

217
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:19,780
And as genomes began to be sequenced and structures of genomes were understood, it became clear that genomes could be copied.

218
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:31,960
And of course, we have two copies in each of our cells, with the exception of red blood cells of our complete genome.

219
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:39,260
But some plants, for example, have six or eight or even more copies of their genome in each of their cells.

220
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,260
So there's large scale genome duplication.

221
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,056
Cell division is clonal duplication of cells.

222
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:53,324
Organismal reproduction works by cell division.

223
00:36:53,452 --> 00:37:19,960
In all known systems, colonies or societies of organisms reproduce themselves, in part through cultural transmission, and entire niches reproduce themselves, for example, in processes like forest evolution, or desertification, or even urbanizaTion.

224
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:27,470
We see humans reproducing the same sorts of niches in city after city, for example.

225
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:37,612
So these forms of copying have the kind of hierarchical dependencies that one might expect.

226
00:37:37,746 --> 00:37:41,120
So to duplicate pathways, you have to duplicate genes.

227
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,840
To duplicate cells, you have to duplicate the genome.

228
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,760
To duplicate organisms, you have to duplicate cells.

229
00:37:50,660 --> 00:38:04,970
And this suggests that this copying operation is indeed scale free, that the copying operation at each level enables the copying operation at the next level.

230
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:23,580
Now, with diversification, we see much the same thing in the early days of the modern synthesis and still in the work of people like Richard Dawkins.

231
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,460
Diversification is generally thought of as random.

232
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,320
So mutation, for example, is thought of as random.

233
00:38:33,460 --> 00:39:10,590
And here I have **Barbara McClintock**, who is kind of the hero of non randomness in doggedly over decades, pointing out that **much of genome diversification is not random at all**, and that genomes actively diversify by moving whole clusters of genes around and duplicating them, or just changing their positions so that they're under the influence of different local control.

234
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:22,772
So at the gene and genome level, you have active diversification by various processes, enzymatic processes.

235
00:39:22,936 --> 00:39:28,076
As McClintock showed us, transposon mediated mechanisms, which are enzymatic at the bottom.

236
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:36,180
Cells actively diversify by lots of different mechanisms.

237
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:53,144
And in the 70s, **Carl Woes** was in part large, personally responsible for pointing out that in the microbial world there's a lot of horizontal gene transfer.

238
00:39:53,262 --> 00:39:57,100
And again, no one believed him for quite a while.

239
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:08,140
But now it's broadly accepted that **microbes exchange DNA very frequently** and across large distances phylogenetically.

240
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:19,410
And this is how things like microbial resistance to antibiotics spread so quickly, or one way that it spreads so quickly.

241
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:30,390
And it's a tremendous agent of essentially speciation to the extent that that even makes any sense in the microbial world.

242
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,200
Of course, in our cells we have functional differentiation.

243
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:49,820
As mentioned earlier, there are lots of symbiotic interactions that lead to diversification in cells by radically altering their local environments.

244
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,900
And of course, sex is a mechanism for diversification.

245
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,520
Organisms actively diversify in many different ways.

246
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:18,500
The most obvious one is just by moving around, by moving to a different environment, the organism is exposed to different inputs and is allowed different outputs, and so it can move into a different direction, morphologically, genetically, et cetera.

247
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:28,680
Organisms can regulate their own evolvability by altering things like DNA repair systems or activating transposons.

248
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:39,660
Again, these are sorts of things that went very much against the grain when they were first discovered, but are now pretty well accepted.

249
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:48,460
And of course, organisms can learn and so can diversify their behavior by diversifying their computational capabilities.

250
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:54,930
And social groups, of course, actively diversify in many different ways.

251
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:14,440
And organisms are increasingly, non human organisms are increasingly regarded as having cultures that they pass on intergenerationally by intergenerational learning and can exchange with other groups.

252
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:21,560
So diversification is active and occurs at every scale.

253
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:29,260
And, again, diversity, although this is a bit less clear than in the case of copying,

254
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,780
diversification mechanisms at one scale enable diversification mechanisms at other scales,

255
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:49,680
so, for example, transpose, unmediated mechanisms enable horizontal gene transfer in microorganisms.

256
00:42:53,990 --> 00:43:09,270
And the FEP tells us that efficiency is actually about intelligence, because the FEP drives systems to build good models of their environments or the behavior of their environments.

257
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:26,330
And what a good model lets a system do is reach a single goal by many different means, because it allows, in a sense, planning, and it allows flexibility and adaptability.

258
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:38,590
And I put **William James** here on this slide because he was the first, as far as I know, to define **intelligence** as this **ability to use different means to reach the same goal**.

259
00:43:39,570 --> 00:44:08,470
Now, in evolution, that's long been known, and it's called **convergent evolution**, when you see two lineages adapting to a single environment with very different genetics and very different morphologies, and often the organisms will end up with similar morphologies that work well in that environment, but very different genetics and very different biochemistry.

260
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:19,094
So throughout evolution, we see this phenomenon of functional convergence, balancing structural divergence at many, many different levels.

261
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:24,030
So we have multiple genes for very similar proteins.

262
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:28,880
We have multiple pathways that do more or less the same thing.

263
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:35,970
We have different cell types that support the same basic functions.

264
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:49,570
We have tissues that are fairly different, but that have the same functions, for example, eyes and different kinds of organisms that allow vision, but have very different structure.

265
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:53,160
And, of course, we have functional convergence and social relations.

266
00:44:54,250 --> 00:45:02,410
And if we look at how cells interact, traditional evolutionary theory really focuses on competition.

267
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:22,880
But we now know that cells cooperate, that they exchange resources in various ways, even across vast differences in phylogeny, for example, the interchange between plants and fungi, or between bacteria and us.

268
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:34,180
We know that cells, in a sense, persuade each other by secreting things like hormones, that cause other cells to do different things.

269
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:46,150
Cells deceive each other, for example, microbes that are trying to escape the immune system, and cells coerce each other.

270
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:51,690
Cells even kill each other when they detect, for example, genetic defects.

271
00:45:52,750 --> 00:46:05,390
So these sorts of social and economic and even political ideas are useful for describing living systems from the level of cells on up.

272
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:13,950
They were developed in social settings to describe what goes on in human societies and then extended to other animals.

273
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:19,966
And now it's very clear that they extend to individual cells.

274
00:46:20,158 --> 00:46:23,570
So when we think about **social intelligence**.

275
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:28,950
We can think about social intelligence even at the level of individual cells.

276
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:38,274
And we see these sorts of competition, cooperation, resource exchange, et cetera, even at the level of microbial mats.

277
00:46:38,322 --> 00:46:42,060
So, biological structures that are 3 billion years old.

278
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,374
Now, of course, intelligence is necessary, but it's not sufficient for being selected.

279
00:46:48,422 --> 00:46:59,322
It won't protect you from impacts of asteroids that happen to land on your planet, which has happened often in the evolution of the Earth.

280
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:04,820
And we're now trying to figure out how to predict and prevent such things.

281
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:10,500
But who knows whether we'll be successful at that?

282
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:20,614
But this intelligence is necessary when it's viewed in this FEP sort of way.

283
00:47:20,732 --> 00:47:27,910
Intelligence is what lets you build models that enable you to predict the environment.

284
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,500
So where does this leave us?

285
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:58,770
By thinking of evolutionary theory in terms of scale-free mechanisms, we seem to have a picture in which we start with quantum systems with a certain level of complexity, and the FEP actually gives us scale-free biology, or something very close to scale-free biology.

286
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,878
And that's very interesting, because the FEP, of course, is a generic principle.

287
00:48:04,974 --> 00:48:09,190
It just says that systems do what they need to do to keep existing.

288
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,390
And this way of thinking gives us some predictions.

289
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:23,930
One is that we'll find compartmentalized problem solving everywhere, because the FEP drives compartmentalization.

290
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:29,930
And the reason is just non-commutativity of measurement processes.

291
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:45,954
It predicts that we'll see hierarchical organization everywhere, in the same way we did on that first compartmentalization slide, where once you have a number of compartments, you need a metacompartment that, if nothing else, distributes free energy.

292
00:48:46,072 --> 00:48:48,866
So some sort of very basic attention system.

293
00:48:49,048 --> 00:48:53,170
And we see attention systems, of course, throughout biology.

294
00:48:55,270 --> 00:49:01,510
It predicts that living systems will have very limited classical data structures.

295
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:31,600
So since they have to write classical data on their boundaries, and their boundaries are much smaller than they are, and because writing classical data is expensive, the living systems will tend to use as little classical data as they can get away with, since classical data is needed for **thermodynamic irreversibility**, where we see thermodynamic irreversibility, that's where we look for classical data.

296
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:38,658
We saw that organisms will be able to detect time first before they can detect space.

297
00:49:38,824 --> 00:49:48,486
So we can expect organisms to have clocks even before they can represent space.

298
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:52,790
And, of course, we see things like diurnal variation throughout biology.

299
00:49:53,850 --> 00:50:01,370
And finally, the FEP predicts this asymptotic collapse of separability back to entanglement.

300
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:10,070
So it predicts that living systems will eventually degrade and become indistinguishable from their environments.

301
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:14,720
And we know that happens at the cell level and the individual organism level.

302
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,390
We call it death.

303
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:33,410
So the FEP seems to give us a lot of the features of biology, and it gives us these features in a scale free way, and it derives them from this very basic physics.

304
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,400
So where does that leave us?

305
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:52,940
I think it leaves us here with a challenge not just to thinking about the FEP, which is what this course has been about, but to quantum information theory in general.

306
00:50:55,150 --> 00:51:17,730
And that challenge is to evolve from the kind of contextuality and theoretical utility that we've been discussing in this course, and which is very well developed in the physics community, to some sorts of empirical and technological utility.

307
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:27,330
And I've listed three areas here where QIT is very active, one in quantum gravity and cosmology.

308
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:38,390
And you're probably familiar with things like string theory that sort of fairly famously seem not to be empirically testable.

309
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:46,620
And the quantum gravity community is enormous, many thousands of people working in this area.

310
00:51:47,070 --> 00:52:00,400
But coming up with theories that can be tested empirically at the scales that we can actually do experiments, so at accessible energy scales, for example, has proved to be very difficult.

311
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:12,770
So this is a real challenge to the field, is somehow getting not just to empirical testability, but to some sort of technological utility.

312
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,474
And you can imagine that if the

313
00:52:15,512 --> 00:52:32,810
main prediction of quantum gravity is that spacetime is emergent, that there could be enormous utility in that some ability to manipulate the way spacetime emerges.

314
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:37,798
The second area, of course, is quantum information and computing.

315
00:52:37,974 --> 00:52:44,670
And here massive resources are being put into technological utility.

316
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:52,000
And I think it's reasonable to expect that we'll have useful quantum computers within a generation, at any rate.

317
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:58,020
So there, I think the field is going quite well.

318
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:03,486
And the last area, what we've talked about here, is quantum biochemistry and biology.

319
00:53:03,678 --> 00:53:21,370
And this, I think, is an area with enormous practice promise that maybe some of you will actually contribute to making this area more useful technologically and more accessible empirically.

320
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:26,060
But at least we have a picture of how these different areas fit together.

321
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,354
So that's it.

322
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:32,400
Thank you very much for participating in this class.

323
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:56,182
Andrew will be doing (unintelligable)

324
00:53:56,356 --> 00:53:59,574
Sorry, could you just repeat the last, like 30 seconds from.

325
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:03,430
Andrew will be Chris.

326
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,470
(unintelligable).

327
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:18,464
Andrew will be discussion session on Saturday, the 20 October at the usual time, a.m.

328
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:19,616
Pacific time.

329
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,048
And the interactive Q and A is open.

330
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,740
I really appreciate your questions.

331
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:27,172
I try to answer them, and.

332
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:28,390
Thank you very much.

333
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:29,956
Awesome.

334
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,550
Can I ask a question, or do you want to call it here?

335
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,364
Sure, go ahead.

336
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:44,760
All right, Inks wrote, Chris spoke last time introducing the mechanisms of scale transition.

337
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:50,040
I'll read your question, then I'll fix the cropping on the live stream.

338
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:59,656
Chris spoke last time introducing the mechanisms of scale transition of these essentially semantic theories about how one scale embeds in another scale.

339
00:54:59,848 --> 00:55:06,572
I would love to learn more about this, especially in terms of natural language semantics and human cognition

340
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,610
semantics versus machine learning.

341
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:12,190
Wow.

342
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,640
Well, that's a very good question.

343
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:48,490
Um, I think that's a very relevant question, given the sorts of machine learning that we see deployed in systems like chat GPT, and especially as these systems start to associate language with images, for example, and as such systems are embedded in robotic systems that can actually move around in the world and interact with real objects.

344
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:57,710
I think one of the key questions in natural language semantics is, to what extent does it depend on reference?

345
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:21,910
To what extent do the meanings we attach to words or the usages that we allow for words depend on our ability to connect words to external objects?

346
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:30,940
And to what extent do those abilities rely on connections between words themselves?

347
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:48,750
So if you think of an LLM like ChatGPT, by itself, it's just a statistical model of relationships between words, as used in some corpus of text, which is large, of course, but we can debate its representativeness.

348
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:57,374
And so that's a model of semantics that's entirely self contained.

349
00:56:57,422 --> 00:57:02,450
It's entirely relations between different pieces of language.

350
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:22,330
Whereas when we start to connect those words, statistics, to images, or better yet, to actual objects that are interacted with not just visually, but haptically, for example, by a robot, they start to be connected to external reference.

351
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:29,660
And that transition, I think, is going to be very, very interesting to watch.

352
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:32,220
And it's just starting.

353
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:39,710
So we all have ringside seats on an incredible experiment in semantics.

354
00:57:41,730 --> 00:58:05,240
And so that would be my response, really, to that question, is, keep your eyes on this experiment and see how it goes, because it's bound to tell us something about how semantics really works.

355
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:18,860
And I suspect that there will be enormous opportunity to start relating the results of that experiment to what we see in developmental psychology, for example.

356
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:21,130
Wow.

357
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:21,980
Awesome.

358
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:32,990
All right, Tucker asks areas of macroscopic quantum mediated phenomena in biology that get Chris Fields excited.

359
00:58:41,030 --> 00:59:02,890
I think the one that excites me the most right now is just this question of how cells are managing to do the information processing that they're doing and how much of it they can accomplish.

360
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:11,580
I think the right way to put it is how can they get away with so little classical information?

361
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:19,440
And I don't think we have the cell biology yet to answer that question.

362
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:28,420
But I think asking the question may help us design the right kinds of cell biology to look for an answer.

363
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:46,390
And our cell biology has been organized around the idea that the structures that we see are essentially static, that they're classical, and that they're constructed in a way that's thermodynamically irreversible.

364
00:59:47,290 --> 01:00:02,874
But if we think of what we measure as not necessarily reflecting a static structure, I think we'll start to conceptualize it differently and build models of it differently.

365
01:00:02,922 --> 01:00:10,990
I mean, clearly, when we look at things like protein structure, we're looking at snapshots of something that's very dynamic.

366
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:21,902
And when we look in a chemistry textbook and we see pictures of this confirmation that changes to that confirmation.

367
01:00:22,046 --> 01:00:35,000
We think of those as static, stable structures, that that's kind of a switch, but it's not actually a switch the way a light switch is.

368
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,640
It's a much more dynamic process.

369
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:54,350
And the kinds of molecular dynamic simulations that allow you to study that process are incredibly complicated and time expensive and uncertain due to resolution problems and other things.

370
01:00:54,420 --> 01:01:08,980
But I think thinking of these as kind of fluid, reversible processes is going to change the way we think about them.

371
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:12,260
That's a great point.

372
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:24,486
And it reminds me of the more physics based way of thinking about the paths that could happen between observations or the statistics based way of samples of a dynamical process.

373
01:01:24,588 --> 01:01:33,286
And in biology, we know that even if we take a snapshot, okay, this organism is 1, it's 2 cm tomorrow, something changed.

374
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:40,262
So we know there was a developmental process, then we know there's an ecological process, and then there's an evolutionary context.

375
01:01:40,326 --> 01:01:41,930
Eco Evo Devo.

376
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:51,150
And then from that, more biological understanding of contextual developing organisms.

377
01:01:51,730 --> 01:02:12,230
All of these different biological phenomena actually help us expand our space of measurement and analysis for material that on one hand, some people may have called inanimate, but then they have their own dynamics, different timescales.

378
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:38,830
And so bringing some of those, like the challenges of measuring and observing, intervening in historical and biological things, gives us a bigger understanding, even on measuring and summarizing, analyzing ensembles or scales that don't immediately appear to have that kind of historiosity, like pieces of silicon or carbon.

379
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,822
Yeah, that's well put.

380
01:02:43,956 --> 01:02:49,102
And I think we have the same problem as we go up in scale.

381
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:59,240
Also, we tend not to think of things like societies as living systems, but in one sense, they clearly are.

382
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:11,382
And to the extent that we can think of these structures that are much larger than we are individually as living systems, cognitive systems, et cetera.

383
01:03:11,446 --> 01:03:13,900
I think we'll understand their dynamics better.

384
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,666
Okay, final question.

385
01:03:16,848 --> 01:03:31,680
Upcycle Club wrote, how can a quantum system detect and respond to quantum context shifts (switches), which are changes in the measurement basis or the entanglement structure of the system.

386
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:34,910
Mmm.

387
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:46,040
Well, the answer here is simple and not very informative.

388
01:03:46,120 --> 01:04:05,940
It's by making measurements, which is all that quantum systems can actually do, and making measurements that follow probing actions that try to push the boundaries of the model of a context.

389
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:23,992
When having this discussion, I always like to go back to the frame problem in artificial intelligence, which is the problem formulated in the late 60s,

390
01:04:24,046 --> 01:04:29,900
of predicting what won't change is the result of an action.

391
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,300
So it's sort of the inverse of the problem of predicting the side effects.

392
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:39,712
And if you could predict all of the side effects, you can predict what doesn't change.

393
01:04:39,766 --> 01:04:43,420
So it's equivalent to the question of predicting all the side effects.

394
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:54,630
And context change is a side effect, and it's often an unobserved and maybe unobservable side effect.

395
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:15,050
But if you have a model that says, I'm working in this context, then you can intentionally probe the boundaries of that model and see if you can actually alter the context you're in as a way of discovering what context you're in.

396
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:19,550
And humans do that in social settings all the time.

397
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:31,692
But I think this is something that we need to think about happening at many different scales.

398
01:05:31,836 --> 01:05:34,930
I suspect that cells are doing this all the time.

399
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:37,170
We just don't know how.

400
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:42,742
There's so much to say there.

401
01:05:42,796 --> 01:05:52,380
It just makes me think of the paradox or the tension between expecting the expected, expecting the unexpected, and life needing to expect both of that.

402
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:53,820
Right.

403
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:56,422
So thank you, Chris.

404
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:58,054
It's been an amazing lecture series.

405
01:05:58,102 --> 01:06:11,490
Many people in the live chat are very appreciative, and we'll look forward to their submitted questions and their participation in the final discussion coming soon.

406
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,846
So thank you, Chris.

407
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,258
Till next time, okay?

408
01:06:14,344 --> 01:06:15,394
And thank you all.

409
01:06:15,512 --> 01:06:15,854
Bye.

410
01:06:15,902 --> 01:06:16,110
Ciao.
