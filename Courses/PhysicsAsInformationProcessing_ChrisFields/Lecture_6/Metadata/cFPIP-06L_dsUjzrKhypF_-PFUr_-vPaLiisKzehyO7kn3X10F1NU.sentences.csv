4320	4870	1	A	0.57	You.
8040	9748	2	B	0.99992	Hello and welcome, everyone.
9914	21968	3	B	0.85684	It is October 12, 2023, and we are in the final lecture, session six in Physics's information processing with Chris Fields.
21984	24832	4	B	0.99122	So, Chris, thank you for this journey.
24976	32892	5	B	0.99968	Exciting to get to this final lecture, which will be followed only by the last discussion for this go around.
32946	34028	6	B	0.9991	So it's really awesome.
34114	36060	7	B	0.99	And to you for this lecture.
38240	39192	8	A	0.99978	Thank you, Daniel.
39256	47200	9	A	1.0	And welcome, everyone, to this last session that I'll be doing with a focus on biology.
48660	51936	10	A	1.0	And just to give a brief review.
52118	67960	11	A	1.0	As usual, we've focused in this course on generic quantum systems, by which I mean just any quantum system that has some number of degrees of freedom.
68300	86940	12	A	1.0	And we really haven't made any assumptions about these systems other than the assumption that both interacting partners have sufficient degrees of freedom that they can be considered separable.
87680	95120	13	A	0.99999	So their boundary is small with respect to the total size of each of the interacting systems.
95940	101212	14	A	1.0	And I want to emphasize again that the approach we've taken is completely topological.
101276	105030	15	A	0.99998	So we haven't assumed anything about embedding in space.
106840	113270	16	A	1.0	And as we've characterized these systems, we focused really on two things.
115000	120760	17	A	1.0	One, the amount of information that the two systems can exchange.
121500	125956	18	A	0.99	And that amount is determined by the size of their boundary.
126068	132280	19	A	0.66492	It's determined by this number, n, which is the Hilbert Space dimension of the boundary.
132440	144000	20	A	0.99	And as we've discussed now in several of the sessions, we can think of this boundary as a collection of N qubits via which the two systems, A and B, communicate.
145140	161200	21	A	1.0	The other feature of the interaction on which we focused is the reference frames that are used by the two systems to interact with this set of qubits.
161280	187710	22	A	1.0	And it's these reference frames that assign the information that flows between A and B, meaning or Functional significance or actionability, or however you want to refer to the idea that when a system gets some information, it does something useful with it.
188720	195440	23	A	0.99993	So those are very generic kinds of ways of characterizing an interaction.
196420	206230	24	A	1.0	You can think of it as a qualitative characterization, the semantics of the information, and a quantitative characterization, the amount of information.
207000	211910	25	A	0.99996	But other than that, we've left the nature of these systems open.
213000	230700	26	A	1.0	And this characterization allowed us to reformulate the free energy principle in quantum information theoretic terms, as the principle that interacting systems behave in a way that will asymptotically align their reference frames.
231360	238380	27	A	0.98	And we saw that full alignment of reference frames is equivalent to entanglement.
238800	249404	28	A	0.9242	So the FEP drives systems toward entanglement, which is not surprising, because that's what happens to generic quantum systems.
249452	254980	29	A	0.99996	They may start out separable, but if they interact long enough, they'll become entangled.
255800	263540	30	A	0.99951	So we've had a discussion that is really very generic.
266380	277000	31	A	0.96	Now, we showed a couple of sessions ago that under these very generic assumptions, we got some interesting outcomes.
277340	300690	32	A	0.99	And one is that if systems have sufficient degrees of freedom under the action of the FEP, they will be driven toward making a diverse set of measurements of their environment, because they're trying to get information about it so that they can predict what it's going to do.
301780	311620	33	A	1.0	And that as they add ways of making measurements, they'll come up against our noncommutativity of their measurements.
312120	320890	34	A	1.0	And this may be due to intrinsic mathematical facts about their measurements, and it may just be due to their limited supply of free energy.
322060	335340	35	A	0.99323	So either way, what this induces is compartmentalization and the requirement for internal, classical communication on internal boundaries.
336160	342716	36	A	0.99951	So I just wanted to reemphasize that this is a result of basic physics.
342908	348080	37	A	1.0	And we see compartmentalization, of course, ubiquitously in biology.
349940	364950	38	A	0.54291	But this suggests to us that features of biology that are very familiar actually follow from fairly deep physics, and compartmentalization is one of them.
366540	385740	39	A	1.0	We then talked last time about space and time and the computational requirements on any system that is able to perceive an external clock or perceive an external spatial layout.
386400	393890	40	A	0.72	And we discussed this from a very kind of developmental psychology point of view.
394500	414340	41	A	1.0	We discussed it using essentially the kinds of terms on the right here, as opposed to the kind of language that's much more technical and mathematical, that's used in physics to derive Spacetime as emergent from information transactions.
417340	425400	42	A	0.76111	But we at least hypothesize that both of these are ways of getting to the same sense of emergent Spacetime.
426140	445040	43	A	1.0	And one important outcome of this discussion was that systems can perceive external clocks, so external periodic behavior with fewer computational resources, so before they're able to perceive spatial layouts.
445380	448050	44	A	1.0	And we'll get back to this later.
449460	463700	45	A	0.9991	So, organisms and maybe other complex systems, seem to manage a collection of capabilities that are all mutually dependent.
464520	474280	46	A	0.62922	So memory depends on having layouts of persistent things that can be distinguished.
475500	480750	47	A	0.76039	So it depends on space, and it certainly depends on time.
484480	488380	48	A	0.99997	Space gives structure to persistent objects.
488720	492960	49	A	0.99999	Memory allows you to identify persistent objects.
493700	500480	50	A	1.0	And objects, in turn, give structure to space by being located in different places.
500980	519880	51	A	1.0	And objects enable the fundamental requirement for memory, which is some form of error correction, so that one has enough redundancy in the memory to check to see whether a memory has been degraded.
520780	537820	52	A	0.99943	So, organisms seem to manage a physically very important process, which is the use of Spacetime and memory as a basis for cognition.
538160	547584	53	A	0.9989	You'll recognize these four functions that are mutually interdependent as underlying complex cognition across the board.
547702	553920	54	A	0.57	And you can't really do complex cognition unless you have these capabilities.
556040	571880	55	A	0.99914	So today, we're going to put some of these things together in a discussion of biology and end by looking forward to future directions, not just in biology, but in all of quantum information theory.
573260	588700	56	A	0.99975	So, let's talk about biological systems, living systems, which, of course, includes us, but also includes all other organisms and communities of organisms and so forth, at multiple scales.
590480	607620	57	A	0.98	And I want to put forward a fairly radical hypothesis that living systems are just generic quantum systems that the FEP has driven to a high level of computational complexity.
608360	611270	58	A	0.99639	So what does this really say?
612120	647360	59	A	0.81825	It suggests that living systems are just quantum systems that have enough degrees of freedom and a sufficiently complicated internal dynamics that the FEP, by requiring them to predict what their environment is going to do next, has driven them to make complicated measurements and complicated inferences on the basis of those measurements that enable fairly complicated actions on the environment.
647700	659940	60	A	0.53448	So these are systems that you would characterize as computers, essentially information processing systems, with a high degree of computational capability.
660920	667568	61	A	1.0	Now, this is clearly as much a philosophical hypothesis as an empirical hypothesis.
667664	674170	62	A	1.0	And that's due in part to the fact that we don't really have a good definition of what a living system is.
674540	679900	63	A	1.0	We can just point and say, that's a living system, and that thing over there isn't.
681040	683720	64	A	1.0	But beyond that, we don't have much of a theory.
683880	687100	65	A	0.79	And, of course, people have worked on a theory of what is life?
687170	692640	66	A	0.9998	For decades, but there's not a lot of agreement.
693620	702332	67	A	0.99	And so this is, in a sense, a definitional kind of hypothesis.
702476	711670	68	A	0.91	And we test such kinds of hypothesis by seeing if they're useful conceptually to help us understand what living systems are doing.
712680	724170	69	A	1.0	Now, as soon as we put forward something like this, inevitably the question comes up, are living systems really quantum systems, or are they classical in some intrinsic sense?
725100	729260	70	A	1.0	And this question is really an artifact of two things.
729330	739016	71	A	1.0	One, the continuing association between quantum systems and microscopic systems, which is, of course, traditional.
739128	743564	72	A	0.99582	Quantum theory, was developed to deal with microscopic phenomena.
743612	748524	73	A	0.5993	It was first tested as a theory of microscopic phenomena.
748652	757430	74	A	1.0	And it's only in the past couple of decades that quantum theory is being applied to big things, to cosmology, for example.
758760	767156	75	A	0.99897	So there's a long tradition of association between quantum and microscopic.
767188	780396	76	A	0.63	And living systems are mesoscopic, much bigger than atoms, bigger than molecules, and they're not nearly as big as cosmological systems, so they're somewhere in between.
780578	792256	77	A	1.0	And those systems have traditionally been regarded as classical, and even chemistry even biochemistry is still taught in a very classical way.
792438	796480	78	A	0.99996	So we're not used to thinking of these things as quantum systems.
797060	813936	79	A	0.99945	But at least in the approach we've taken in this course, all physical systems are quantum systems, and classical information exists only on boundaries, only on boundaries between systems, and it only describes their interaction.
814128	825690	80	A	1.0	And I want to emphasize, I've said it before, but since this is the last class, I want to say it again, that this is not a universally held view.
828880	832110	81	A	0.87209	It's a view that's becoming more common.
834560	840350	82	A	1.0	And I think a generation from now it will probably be the dominant view of things.
841200	847232	83	A	0.99975	But it's not fair to say that it's the dominant view now.
847366	854820	84	A	0.97287	It's, I think, quite fair to say that it's a view on the rise, especially in the quantum information and quantum gravity communities.
855800	861350	85	A	0.99994	But from a strict empirical perspective, we know a number of things.
862040	868440	86	A	1.0	We know that accurate molecular dynamics calculations require quantum theory.
869580	878680	87	A	1.0	We know that a lot of biologically important molecular processes use quantum coherence.
879040	886060	88	A	1.0	We know that things like hydrogen bonding can only be understood using quantum theory.
887520	896844	89	A	1.0	We know that cellular free energy budgets are way too small to support fully classical information processing.
896892	913856	90	A	0.99999	If we think of information processing in terms of what proteins are doing or what other molecules are doing in terms of changing shape, we know that shape changes in proteins and other molecules underlie all cellular information processing.
914048	922840	91	A	0.99996	So if we think of them as actually implementing cellular information processing, we have way more information processing than could be funded classically.
923900	928276	92	A	1.0	And finally, we know that human cognition exhibits contextuality.
928388	932152	93	A	0.99997	So human cognition uses quantum coherence.
932216	945292	94	A	0.9998	It's not a classical causal process in all cases, but this is still a very nascent field, and it's a field with a lot of potential.
945356	960470	95	A	1.0	And I think again, a generation from now, quantum biology is going to be regarded as a very mainstream endeavor, even though it's something of a small emerging field now.
961400	966470	96	A	1.0	And I'll just show you one picture in support of this third point.
968700	985420	97	A	0.81	This is a plot of measured free energy usage converted to numbers of bits processed at one kHz for a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
985840	997250	98	A	0.99997	All that I could find a few years ago that had good calliometric measurements versus the log of their area, their membrane surface area.
998180	1008950	99	A	1.0	And the thing to note here is that these cells are processing classical information at pretty low rates, KHz to gigahertz rates, for 1000 bits at a time.
1010280	1015430	100	A	1.0	And we know that a lot more is happening in cells than that.
1015960	1021930	101	A	0.99969	Cells have many more than 1000 proteins, and those proteins are all moving all the time.
1022460	1035980	102	A	1.0	And if that motion is processing information, then there's not nearly enough classical, not nearly enough thermodynamic power to power all of that information processing.
1038240	1048850	103	A	0.99955	So let's now talk a little bit about life and living systems and what they look like.
1049860	1054960	104	A	0.50614	Here's a view of living systems from the point of view of genome diversity.
1055040	1062020	105	A	1.0	This is a few years old, so it's out of date by now, but it tells us a lot qualitatively.
1064120	1082168	106	A	0.99992	It tells us that almost all genome diversity is microbial, that the sorts of organisms that we're familiar with, medium sized organisms like us, animals and plants, have only a tiny amount of genome diversity.
1082264	1085432	107	A	0.99996	So we think of ourselves as pretty diverse.
1085496	1094624	108	A	1.0	We think of ourselves as quite different from other animals, from flies or worms or sponges or something like that.
1094742	1098112	109	A	0.66251	But in fact, we're not all that different from them.
1098246	1101644	110	A	1.0	We share many, many proteins with all of those other organisms.
1101692	1105380	111	A	1.0	We share the same cellular organization and so forth.
1105800	1114980	112	A	0.68351	We're not, in fact, all that different from plants, and we're much more similar to the fungi than to the plants.
1115960	1125000	113	A	0.99684	So we get a very biased view of genome diversity when we just look at familiar, large types of living systems.
1125820	1130510	114	A	0.99996	Most genome diversity is buried down there in the microbial world.
1132240	1139608	115	A	1.0	This isn't the only way we can look at life as a diverse set of organisms.
1139784	1143440	116	A	1.0	We can also look at it in terms of a cell lineage.
1144580	1157600	117	A	1.0	The fact that we're all related at the DNA level tells us that we're all descendants of a common ancestor, which is usually called LUCA, the last universal common ancestor.
1158580	1167320	118	A	0.99	And LUCA is generally modeled as being a cell, more or less like a bacterial cell.
1167390	1174484	119	A	0.99693	So fairly simple, with not very many pathways, with maybe a DNA genome.
1174612	1183500	120	A	1.0	And if LUCA didn't have one, then they arose fairly shortly thereafter, because all organisms that we know of have DNA genomes.
1184640	1204820	121	A	0.99998	But the point of looking at life as a lineage is that we get a diagram that looks very much like the cell lineage from an embryological situation, much like the cell lineage of our own bodies growing from a fertilized egg.
1206040	1231100	122	A	0.99	And in particular, looking at life as a lineage shows us that not only do we share DNA with all other organisms, we actually share a membrane cytoplasm that's continuous in time all the way back to Leuka, and so continuous in time between us and bacteria.
1232000	1248480	123	A	0.99992	So if you look at life this way, you realize that life is, in a sense, all one organism, all one connected structure that's developed over time through division, cell division.
1249140	1261732	124	A	1.0	And so we are very closely related to all other parts of life in the same way that different cells in our bodies are closely related to each other.
1261866	1263332	125	A	1.0	The time span is just longer.
1263386	1271400	126	A	0.99	I mean, here the time span is three and a half or 4 billion years between us and LUCA.
1272540	1277524	127	A	0.99995	These lineages have been diverging for that long, but they're still continuous.
1277652	1283420	128	A	1.0	And in particular, they form a continuous cell membrane.
1284320	1295250	129	A	0.99899	So when you think of life in this way, we realize that we are reasoning from just one example when we think about terrestrial life.
1295780	1310740	130	A	0.99	And this strongly limits what we can say about living systems, what we can say about biology, that we really only have one example, the lineage that descends from LUCA here on Earth.
1311160	1313488	131	A	0.99	And at some point, we may have more examples.
1313584	1326650	132	A	1.0	And there's certainly groups working on artificial organisms that aren't part of this Lineage, that are constructed from parts derived from this Lineage, but aren't members of this Lineage themselves.
1327660	1330270	133	A	1.0	And that may tell us something new about life.
1333280	1346080	134	A	0.99998	But if we think of life this way, we see something very important, which is that as life Grows, its boundary gets bigger.
1347700	1368440	135	A	1.0	And since the boundary of a system constitutes its informational environment, its dimension getting bigger means that more information flows into it from its environment and more information flows out of it into its environment.
1369180	1380700	136	A	0.99099	So as life develops from LUCA, it gets a larger and larger informational environment, and this dimension of its boundary grows and grows.
1381200	1393680	137	A	1.0	Now, what that means, if you go back to our original picture of two interacting systems, is that the dimensionality of the physical environment is decreasing.
1394980	1398688	138	A	0.9	And we think of the physical environment as increasing in size.
1398774	1401248	139	A	1.0	We have the expanding universe and all that.
1401414	1403970	140	A	0.99926	But what's increasing in size is space.
1405080	1413632	141	A	0.95	And if space is emergent, then that increase is not a real increase in degrees of freedom.
1413776	1422490	142	A	0.99964	What we're really interested in is the Hilbert Space of the physical environment, as distinct from the Hilbert space of life.
1423340	1430972	143	A	0.99	And as life gets bigger, it literally qubits, literally eats the physical environment and turns it into more life.
1431106	1433710	144	A	0.99999	So there's less physical environment around.
1434960	1441048	145	A	0.99998	So the trajectory of life is toward a bigger informational environment and a smaller physical environment.
1441224	1446556	146	A	0.71	And as the physical environment gets smaller, you might imagine it gets easier to predict.
1446748	1455300	147	A	0.96	And as the Informational environment gets bigger, you have more information with which to predict the behavior of the physical environment.
1455960	1459780	148	A	0.99992	So this all hangs together very nicely with the free energy principle.
1460760	1463350	149	A	0.72036	Here's another picture of this same thing.
1464520	1474490	150	A	0.99997	If we start with some boundary here on the left labeled B, around some system labeled S, and it's embedded in an environment, E.
1475420	1495810	151	A	0.82106	Then as S makes copies of itself through some process like cell division, then it starts to fill up more of E, it's actually converting degrees of freedom of E into degrees of freedom of its copies that it's made of itself.
1496900	1504320	152	A	1.0	And if we think of some larger boundary drawn somewhere in E, here on the right side, I've labeled that B prime.
1505080	1515140	153	A	0.99522	What happens is that B prime gets slowly filled up with copies of S, and it starts to look like a large organism.
1516200	1519428	154	A	0.99	And that's what life is doing in the physical environment.
1519524	1527560	155	A	0.99398	It's making a bigger boundary for itself at the expense of degrees of freedom of its physical environment.
1528620	1531790	156	A	0.99996	So we can ask, what drives this process?
1532960	1534364	157	A	0.99997	Why is life doing this?
1534402	1536670	158	A	0.54027	Why is it making copies of itself?
1537840	1544850	159	A	1.0	And the answer to that question, at least one answer to that question, is the free energy principle drives it to do this.
1545940	1556660	160	A	1.0	And I'll just show you some simulations from several years ago of a cell population.
1557240	1571432	161	A	0.64636	In this upper left panel, the green cells are stem cells that divide, and they've been embedded in an environment that's safe on the left side and 100% lethal on the right side.
1571566	1580830	162	A	0.9999	So they're embedded in an environment that's conducive to life on one side and very dangerous as you get toward the middle.
1582240	1604056	163	A	1.0	And the purpose of these simulations was to study what happens when the stem cells are able to divide and create not just other stem cells, but create specialized progeny that don't divide.
1604188	1617400	164	A	0.53465	So somatic progeny that don't divide and hence have free energy resources, thermodynamic resources, that they can devote to doing something other than dividing.
1618940	1622330	165	A	0.57857	Cell division is incredibly expensive when it comes to energy.
1622700	1636712	166	A	0.99994	So if you take that energy and apply it not to cell division, but to protecting the stem cells, you can allow the stem cell population to expand.
1636776	1639548	167	A	1.0	And that's what these other simulations show.
1639634	1646240	168	A	1.0	The blue cells are somatic cells that have very varying ability to protect the stem cells.
1647140	1664340	169	A	0.9	And if they're fairly good at protection and they're fairly hard to kill, down in the right bottom Quadrant, you can actually get a population expanding well into the highly lethal part of the environment.
1664920	1669560	170	A	0.89812	So this shows you the FEP in action.
1671500	1694428	171	A	0.99987	What the stem cells are doing is constructing a very predictable neighborhood around themselves in the environment by dividing to make progeny that don't themselves divide, that just sit there and help protect the stem cells.
1694524	1707940	172	A	0.9952	So the stem cells are now living in a safer, more predictable environment, and that allows them to invade more and more of their physical environment by having this fairly benign, informational environment.
1708520	1716340	173	A	0.99641	So this is the FEP in action driving the expansion of life at the expense of the physical environment.
1718940	1732750	174	A	0.99919	So that lets us go back to this question that was raised last time about the mechanism of these scale transitions that we see ubiquitously in life.
1733680	1751248	175	A	0.74299	Life gets bigger and bigger as time goes on phytogenetically and as time goes on developmentally, we start with some molecular pathways that somehow get assembled into a cell.
1751334	1754370	176	A	0.99998	That's the origin of life question, how does that happen?
1755640	1764980	177	A	1.0	And about 2 billion years later, cells start to group together to make multicellular organisms.
1765560	1771800	178	A	1.0	Now, bacteria group together to make facultative multicellular systems like microbial maps.
1772140	1775210	179	A	1.0	3 billion years ago, very, very early on.
1776140	1788030	180	A	0.99998	But we don't see the emergence of obligate multicellulars until much, much later, before the Cambrian explosion, but still less than a billion years ago.
1788960	1792290	181	A	1.0	And from there, things get more complicated very quickly.
1792740	1798880	182	A	0.62981	So one has large multicellular organisms.
1799780	1813700	183	A	0.99986	They develop complicated social relations that probably first emerged with social insects, but are certainly well developed in invertebrates, including in mammals.
1817340	1824360	184	A	0.78259	Organisms group together in very complex ecosystems.
1825260	1835800	185	A	1.0	And recall here that it's now known that all multicellular organisms have obligate microbial symbiotes.
1835880	1843788	186	A	0.99997	So all of our bodies are, in fact, very complex ecosystems populated by many, many different species of bacteria.
1843964	1850450	187	A	1.0	And that's true not just for us, but for trees and insects and worms and sponges and everything else.
1851220	1862012	188	A	0.99424	So organisms, from a body point of view, are themselves ecosystems.
1862076	1873376	189	A	0.98	And organisms organize themselves into ecosystems, and these ecosystems come into contact across the entire biosphere.
1873568	1884840	190	A	0.99764	So processes as simple as the wind disperse organisms as small as bacteria all over the planet.
1885980	1900030	191	A	0.99941	So this scaling of life toward larger and larger organizational structures is, in a sense, the major thing for biology to explain.
1901360	1923010	192	A	0.87	And the hypothesis that we floated last time was that this transition from very small scales to very large scales uses the same mechanism over and over again, or a mechanism that has the same structure over and over again.
1923940	1928156	193	A	0.99963	So the renormalization group is trivial.
1928268	1935130	194	A	0.9999	Basically, it's just the identity operating at different scales or mapping from one scale to the next.
1935980	1939770	195	A	0.98937	So the question is, can we approach this in any way?
1940220	1941770	196	A	0.91802	Does this make sense?
1943280	1958160	197	A	0.95	And to try to make sense of it, we can go to the R1 developed theory that we have in biology, which has been formulated by Dawkins and others as universal Darwinism.
1959380	1968480	198	A	1.0	This is just kind of an abstraction of the modern synthesis between Darwinian evolution and genetics.
1969720	1974948	199	A	0.51678	But universal Darwinism is incredibly simple and very obvious.
1975034	1981480	200	A	0.99821	It says if you have systems and they can copy each other, they can copy themselves, and the copies can diversify.
1982380	2004140	201	A	0.99982	Then if you want to know what's going to happen at the population level, what you will find is the systems that copy themselves and diversify most efficiently will win because there'll be more of them, so they end up dominating the population, and winning gets called natural selection.
2004480	2010112	202	A	0.60682	But natural selection is not an extra part of the Darwinian process.
2010246	2022100	203	A	0.99951	It's just the outcome of efficiency of the systems that copy themselves most efficiently, coming to dominate any population.
2023000	2032040	204	A	0.9948	So there's no sort of kind of hand of god or whatever, reaching down and selecting some organisms and not others.
2032110	2052030	205	A	0.98	And of course, when Darwin put the idea of natural selection together, he was thinking very explicitly of the analogy of a gardener or a farmer selecting the crops or the animals or whatever that the gardener liked best, and keeping those.
2052400	2055084	206	A	1.0	And that's where this selection metaphor comes from.
2055122	2061484	207	A	0.54238	But there's no real process of selection in evolution by natural selection.
2061532	2064000	208	A	0.89431	It's just copying and diversifying.
2065140	2082410	209	A	0.99999	But this clearly is just the outline of what a real mechanistic theory would be, because we need to have a story about what copying is and what diversifying is and what efficiently means.
2084620	2101260	210	A	0.55	And in particular, to address the question that we raised a couple of slides ago, we need to know whether these mechanisms are the same, or at least isomorphic, of the same form at different scales.
2102080	2107810	211	A	0.99979	So that's what I want to talk about for the next little bit.
2111000	2112980	212	A	0.97656	Let's start with copying.
2119540	2131296	213	A	1.0	Up until the 70s, copying in biology really meant DNA replication and, to some extent, cell division.
2131488	2135560	214	A	1.0	But the focus in evolutionary theory was on DNA replication.
2136700	2147020	215	A	0.78	And in the 70s, it was realized that whole genes could be duplicated, so whole genes could be copied.
2148480	2169680	216	A	1.0	And then shortly after that, it was realized that particularly in prokaryotes, where genes, functionally related genes are next to each other in chromosomes, often in what are called operons, that operons could be duplicated and so entire pathways could be duplicated.
2170740	2179780	217	A	1.0	And as genomes began to be sequenced and structures of genomes were understood, it became clear that genomes could be copied.
2180600	2191960	218	A	1.0	And of course, we have two copies in each of our cells, with the exception of red blood cells of our complete genome.
2192620	2199260	219	A	0.99993	But some plants, for example, have six or eight or even more copies of their genome in each of their cells.
2199600	2203260	220	A	0.90947	So there's large scale genome duplication.
2204480	2208056	221	A	0.99997	Cell division is clonal duplication of cells.
2208248	2213324	222	A	0.98165	Organismal reproduction works by cell division.
2213452	2239960	223	A	0.99305	In all known systems, colonies or societies of organisms reproduce themselves, in part through cultural transmission, and entire niches reproduce themselves, for example, in processes like forest evolution or desertification, or even urbanizaTion.
2241100	2247470	224	A	1.0	We see humans reproducing the same sorts of niches in city after city, for example.
2248800	2257612	225	A	0.99955	So these forms of copying have the kind of hierarchical dependencies that one might expect.
2257746	2261120	226	A	0.99985	So to duplicate pathways, you have to duplicate genes.
2262260	2265840	227	A	1.0	To duplicate cells, you have to duplicate the genome.
2266340	2269760	228	A	1.0	To duplicate organisms, you have to duplicate cells.
2270660	2284970	229	A	1.0	And this suggests that this copying operation is indeed scale free, that the copying operation at each level enables the copying operation at the next level.
2286780	2303580	230	A	1.0	Now, with diversification, we see much the same thing in the early days of the modern synthesis and still in the work of people like Richard Dawkins.
2304240	2308460	231	A	0.99785	Diversification is generally thought of as random.
2308820	2312320	232	A	0.98183	So mutation, for example, is thought of as random.
2313460	2350590	233	A	0.95	And here I have Barbara McClintock, who is kind of the hero of non randomness in doggedly over decades, pointing out that much of genome diversification is not random at all, and that genomes actively diversify by moving whole clusters of genes around and duplicating them, or just changing their positions so that they're under the influence of different local control.
2352400	2362772	234	A	0.99264	So at the gene and genome level, you have active diversification by various processes, enzymatic processes.
2362936	2368076	235	A	0.51868	As McClintock showed us, transposon mediated mechanisms, which are enzymatic.
2368268	2376180	236	A	1.0	At the bottom, cells actively diversify by lots of different mechanisms.
2376680	2393144	237	A	1.0	And in the 70s, Carl Woes was in part large, personally responsible for pointing out that in the microbial world there's a lot of gene transfer.
2393262	2397100	238	A	1.0	And again, no one believed him for quite a while.
2397250	2408140	239	A	0.99998	But now it's broadly accepted that microbes exchange DNA very frequently and across large distances phylogenetically.
2408900	2419410	240	A	1.0	And this is how things like microbial resistance to antibiotics spread so quickly, or one way that it spreads so quickly.
2420340	2430390	241	A	1.0	And it's a tremendous agent of essentially speciation to the extent that that even makes any sense in the microbial world.
2431880	2436200	242	A	1.0	Of course, in our cells we have functional differentiation.
2439180	2449820	243	A	0.64174	As mentioned earlier, there are lots of symbiotic interactions that lead to diversification in cells by radically altering their local environments.
2450480	2453900	244	A	1.0	And of course, sex is a mechanism for diversification.
2456240	2459520	245	A	0.99925	Organisms actively diversify in many different ways.
2459590	2478500	246	A	1.0	The most obvious one is just by moving around, by moving to a different environment, the organism is exposed to different inputs and is allowed different outputs, and so it can move into a different direction, morphologically, genetically, et cetera.
2479320	2488680	247	A	0.75952	Organisms can regulate their own evolvability by altering things like DNA repair systems or activating transposons.
2489980	2499660	248	A	0.99995	Again, these are sorts of things that went very much against the grain when they were first discovered, but are now pretty well accepted.
2500080	2508460	249	A	1.0	And of course, urorganism can learn and so can diversify their behavior by diversifying their computational capabilities.
2509620	2514930	250	A	0.64	And social groups, of course, actively diversify in many different ways.
2515780	2534440	251	A	1.0	And organisms are increasingly, non human organisms are increasingly regarded as having cultures that they pass on intergenerationally by intergenerational learning and can exchange with other groups.
2535340	2541560	252	A	0.99975	So diversification is active and occurs at every scale.
2542380	2549260	253	A	1.0	And, again, diversity, although this is a bit less clear than in the case of copying.
2550240	2556780	254	A	0.99992	Diversification mechanisms at one scale enable diversification mechanisms at other scales.
2558740	2569680	255	A	0.9354	So, for example, transpose, unmediated mechanisms enable horizontal gene transfer in microorganisms.
2573990	2589270	256	A	0.54	And the FEP tells us that efficiency is actually about intelligence, because the FEP drives systems to build good models of their environments or the behavior of their environments.
2589930	2606330	257	A	0.98	And what a good model lets a system do is reach a single goal by many different means, because it allows, in a sense, planning, and it allows flexibility and adaptability.
2606910	2618590	258	A	0.99	And I put William James here on this slide because he was the first, as far as I know, to define intelligence as this ability to use different means to reach the same goal.
2619570	2648470	259	A	1.0	Now, in evolution, that's long been known, and it's called convergent evolution, when you see two lineages adapting to a single environment with very different genetics and very different morphologies, and often the organisms will end up with similar morphologies that work well in that environment, but very different genetics and very different biochemistry.
2649230	2659094	260	A	0.99988	So throughout evolution, we see this phenomenon of functional convergence, balancing structural divergence at many, many different levels.
2659142	2664030	261	A	0.99985	So we have multiple genes for very similar proteins.
2664610	2668880	262	A	1.0	We have multiple pathways that do more or less the same thing.
2670050	2675970	263	A	1.0	We have different cell types that support the same basic functions.
2676950	2689570	264	A	1.0	We have tissues that are fairly different, but that have the same functions, for example, eyes and different kinds of organisms that allow vision, but have very different structure.
2689730	2693160	265	A	1.0	And, of course, we have functional convergence and social relations.
2694250	2702410	266	A	1.0	And if we look at how cells interact, traditional evolutionary theory really focuses on competition.
2703310	2722880	267	A	0.81167	But we now know that cells cooperate, that they exchange resources in various ways, even across vast differences in phylogeny, for example, the interchange between plants and fungi, or between bacteria and us.
2724630	2734180	268	A	1.0	We know that cells, in a sense, persuade each other by secreting things like hormones, that cause other cells to do different things.
2736490	2746150	269	A	0.99975	Cells deceive each other, for example, microbes that are trying to escape the immune system, and cells coerce each other.
2746220	2751690	270	A	0.9999	Cells even kill each other when they detect, for example, genetic defects.
2752750	2765390	271	A	0.99977	So these sorts of social and economic and even political ideas are useful for describing living systems from the level of cells on up.
2765540	2773950	272	A	0.99999	They were developed in social settings to describe what goes on in human societies and then extended to other animals.
2774550	2779966	273	A	1.0	And now it's very clear that they extend to individual cells.
2780158	2783570	274	A	0.99994	So when we think about social intelligence.
2784150	2788950	275	A	1.0	We can think about social intelligence even at the level of individual cells.
2789450	2798274	276	A	0.83	And we see these sorts of competition, cooperation, resource exchange, et cetera, even at the level of microbial mats.
2798322	2802060	277	A	0.99992	So, biological structures that are 3 billion years old.
2803710	2808374	278	A	1.0	Now, of course, intelligence is necessary, but it's not sufficient for being selected.
2808422	2819322	279	A	0.99983	It won't protect you from impacts of asteroids that happen to land on your planet, which has happened often in the evolution of the Earth.
2819386	2824820	280	A	1.0	And we're now trying to figure out how to predict and prevent such things.
2825830	2830500	281	A	0.9818	But who knows whether we'll be successful at that?
2831750	2840614	282	A	0.90844	But this intelligence is necessary when it's viewed in this FEP sort of way.
2840732	2847910	283	A	0.92422	Intelligence is what lets you build models that enable you to predict the environment.
2849470	2851500	284	A	0.98252	So where does this leave us?
2854350	2878770	285	A	0.99983	By thinking of evolutionary theory in terms of scale free mechanisms, we seem to have a picture in which we start with quantum systems with a certain level of complexity, and the FEP actually gives us scale free biology, or something very close to scale free biology.
2880310	2884878	286	A	0.99	And that's very interesting, because the FEP, of course, is a generic principle.
2884974	2889190	287	A	0.54097	It just says that systems do what they need to do to keep existing.
2891050	2894390	288	A	0.98	And this way of thinking gives us some predictions.
2895770	2903930	289	A	1.0	One is that we'll find compartmentalized problem solving everywhere, because the FEP drives compartmentalization.
2904350	2909930	290	A	0.92	And the reason is just non commutativity of measurement processes.
2910830	2925954	291	A	0.56269	It predicts that we'll see hierarchical organization everywhere, in the same way we did on that first compartmentalization slide, where once you have a number of compartments, you need a metacompartment that, if nothing else, distributes free energy.
2926072	2928866	292	A	0.99999	So some sort of very basic attention system.
2929048	2933170	293	A	1.0	And we see attention systems, of course, throughout biology.
2935270	2941510	294	A	0.84723	It predicts that living systems will have very limited classical data structures.
2942010	2971600	295	A	0.99992	So since they have to write classical data on their boundaries, and their boundaries are much smaller than they are, and because writing classical data is expensive, the living systems will tend to use as little classical data as they can get away with, since classical data is needed for thermodynamic irreversibility, where we see thermodynamic irreversibility, that's where we look for classical data.
2972610	2978658	296	A	1.0	We saw that organisms will be able to detect time first before they can detect space.
2978824	2988486	297	A	0.99832	So we can expect organisms to have clocks even before they can represent space.
2988668	2992790	298	A	0.98	And, of course, we see things like diurnal variation throughout biology.
2993850	3001370	299	A	0.99	And finally, the FEP predicts this asymptotic collapse of separability back to entanglement.
3001710	3010070	300	A	0.99534	So it predicts that living systems will eventually degrade and become indistinguishable from their environments.
3010230	3014720	301	A	0.51	And we know that happens at the cell level and the individual organism level.
3015970	3017390	302	A	1.0	We call it death.
3018690	3033410	303	A	0.84387	So the FEP seems to give us a lot of the features of biology, and it gives us these features in a scale free way, and it derives them from this very basic physics.
3035430	3037400	304	A	0.99448	So where does that leave us?
3038170	3052940	305	A	1.0	I think it leaves us here with a challenge not just to thinking about the FEP, which is what this course has been about, but to quantum information theory in general.
3055150	3077730	306	A	0.99	And that challenge is to evolve from the kind of contextuality and theoretical utility that we've been discussing in this course, and which is very well developed in the physics community, to some sorts of empirical and topological utility.
3079030	3087330	307	A	0.99	And I've listed three areas here where QIt is very active, one in quantum gravity and cosmology.
3087930	3098390	308	A	0.86	And you're probably familiar with things like string theory that sort of fairly famously seem not to be empirically testable.
3099310	3106620	309	A	1.0	And the quantum gravity community is enormous, many thousands of people working in this area.
3107070	3120400	310	A	0.99993	But coming up with theories that can be tested empirically at the scales that we can actually do experiments, so at accessible energy scales, for example, has proved to be very difficult.
3121970	3132770	311	A	0.9999	So this is a real challenge to the field, is somehow getting not just to empirical testability, but to some sort of technological utility.
3133510	3135474	312	A	1.0	And you can imagine that if the.
3135512	3152810	313	A	0.59423	If the main prediction of quantum gravity is that Spacetime is emergent, that there could be enormous utility in that some ability to manipulate the way Spacetime emerges.
3153870	3157798	314	A	0.87	The second area, of course, is quantum information and computing.
3157974	3164670	315	A	0.62	And here massive resources are being put into technological utility.
3165250	3172000	316	A	1.0	And I think it's reasonable to expect that we'll have useful quantum computers within a generation, at any rate.
3173170	3178020	317	A	0.99982	So there, I think the field is going quite well.
3178390	3183486	318	A	0.71	And the last area, what we've talked about here, is quantum biochemistry and biology.
3183678	3201370	319	A	1.0	And this, I think, is an area with enormous practice promise that maybe some of you will actually contribute to making this area more useful topological and more accessible empirically.
3202030	3206060	320	A	0.90395	But at least we have a picture of how these different areas fit together.
3207470	3209354	321	A	0.99816	So that's it.
3209472	3212400	322	A	0.99994	Thank you very much for participating in this class.
3213570	3236182	323	A	0.49039	Andrew will be doing your questions.
3236356	3239574	324	B	0.99854	Sorry, could you just repeat the last, like 30 seconds from.
3239612	3243430	325	B	0.8675	Andrew will be Chris.
3250320	3251470	326	A	0.32831	Kick up.
3252080	3258464	327	A	0.85896	Andrew will be discussion session on Saturday, the 20 October at the usual time, 08:00 a.m.
3258502	3259616	328	A	0.53146	Pacific time.
3259798	3262048	329	A	0.57	And the interactive Q and A is open.
3262134	3263740	330	A	1.0	I really appreciate your questions.
3263830	3267172	331	A	1.0	I try to answer them, and.
3267226	3268390	332	A	0.99995	Thank you very much.
3269400	3269956	333	B	0.9997	Awesome.
3270058	3272550	334	B	0.9998	Can I ask a question, or do you want to call it here?
3274200	3275364	335	A	0.99938	Sure, go ahead.
3275482	3284760	336	B	0.97603	All right, Inks wrote, Chris spoke last time introducing the mechanisms of scale transition.
3287180	3290040	337	B	0.9986	I'll read your question, then I'll fix the cropping on the live stream.
3290200	3299656	338	B	0.99092	Chris spoke last time introducing the mechanisms of scale transition of these essentially semantic theories about how one scale embeds in another scale.
3299848	3306572	339	B	1.0	I would love to learn more about this, especially in terms of natural language semantics and human cognition.
3306636	3308610	340	B	0.99415	Semantics versus machine learning.
3311490	3312190	341	A	0.99917	Wow.
3312340	3314640	342	A	0.82124	Well, that's a very good question.
3315810	3348490	343	A	0.57936	Um, I think that's a very relevant question, given the sorts of machine learning that we see deployed in systems like chat GPT, and especially as these systems start to associate language with images, for example, and as such systems are embedded in robotic systems that can actually move around in the world and interact with real objects.
3350590	3357710	344	A	1.0	I think one of the key questions in natural language semantics is, to what extent does it depend on reference?
3358770	3381910	345	A	1.0	To what extent do the meanings we attach to words or the usages that we allow for words depend on our ability to connect words to external objects?
3382570	3390940	346	A	0.61	And to what extent do those abilities rely on connections between words themselves?
3391870	3408750	347	A	0.99836	So if you think of an LLM like chat GPT, by itself, it's just a statistical model of relationships between words, as used in some corpus of text, which is large, of course, but we can debate its representativeness.
3410450	3417374	348	A	1.0	And so that's a model of semantics that's entirely self contained.
3417422	3422450	349	A	0.85075	It's entirely relations between different pieces of language.
3423110	3442330	350	A	0.93233	Whereas when we start to connect those words, statistics, to images, or better yet, to actual objects that are interacted with not just visually, but haptically, for example, by a robot, they start to be connected to external reference.
3443390	3449660	351	A	1.0	And that transition, I think, is going to be very interesting to watch.
3450510	3452220	352	A	1.0	And it's just starting.
3452770	3459710	353	A	0.99934	So we all have ringside seats on an incredible experiment in semantics.
3461730	3485240	354	A	0.99	And so that would be my response, really, to that question, is, keep your eyes on this experiment and see how it goes, because it's bound to tell us something about how semantics really works.
3486170	3498860	355	A	1.0	And I suspect that there will be enormous opportunity to start relating the results of that experiment to what we see in developmental psychology, for example.
3500430	3501130	356	B	0.99645	Wow.
3501280	3501980	357	B	0.99961	Awesome.
3502450	3512990	358	B	0.92376	All right, Tucker asks areas of macroscopic quantum mediated phenomena in biology that get Chris Fields excited.
3521030	3542890	359	A	1.0	I think the one that excites me the most right now is just this question of how cells are managing to do the information processing that they're doing and how much of it they can accomplish.
3546110	3551580	360	A	1.0	I think the right way to put it is how can they get away with so little classical information?
3553250	3559440	361	A	0.52	And I don't think we have the cell biology yet to answer that question.
3560610	3568420	362	A	0.99999	But I think asking the question may help us design the right kinds of cell biology to look for an answer.
3569270	3586390	363	A	1.0	And our cell biology has been organized around the idea that the structures that we see are essentially static, that they're classical, and that they're constructed in a way that's thermodynamically irreversible.
3587290	3602874	364	A	0.99995	But if we think of what we measure as not necessarily reflecting a static structure, I think we'll start to conceptualize it differently and build models of it differently.
3602922	3610990	365	A	0.99	I mean, clearly, when we look at things like protein structure, we're looking at snapshots of something that's very dynamic.
3612130	3621902	366	A	1.0	And when we look in a chemistry textbook and we see pictures of this confirmation that changes to that confirmation.
3622046	3635000	367	A	1.0	We think of those as static, stable structures, that that's kind of a switch, but it's not actually a switch the way a light switch is.
3635450	3637640	368	A	0.93328	It's a much more dynamic process.
3638570	3654350	369	A	1.0	And the kinds of molecular dynamic simulations that allow you to study that process are incredibly complicated and time expensive and uncertain due to resolution problems and other things.
3654420	3668980	370	A	0.99904	But I think thinking of these as kind of fluid, reversible processes is going to change the way we think about them.
3670630	3672260	371	B	0.6298	That's a great point.
3672630	3684486	372	B	0.88	And it reminds me of the more physics based way of thinking about the paths that could happen between observations or the statistics based way of samples of a dynamical process.
3684588	3693286	373	B	0.99	And in biology, we know that even if we take a snapshot, okay, this organism is 1, it's 2 cm tomorrow, something changed.
3693318	3700262	374	B	0.99995	So we know there was a developmental process, then we know there's an ecological process, and then there's an evolutionary context.
3700326	3701930	375	B	0.7676	Eco Evo Devo.
3702370	3711150	376	B	1.0	And then from that, more biological understanding of contextual developing organisms.
3711730	3732230	377	B	0.99999	All of these different biological phenomena actually help us expand our space of measurement and analysis for material that on one hand, some people may have called inanimate, but then they have their own dynamics, different timescales.
3733210	3758830	378	B	1.0	And so bringing some of those, like the challenges of measuring and observing, intervening in historical and biological things, gives us a bigger understanding, even on measuring and summarizing, analyzing ensembles or scales that don't immediately appear to have that kind of historiosity, like pieces of silicon or carbon.
3761090	3763822	379	A	0.9999	Yeah, that's well put.
3763956	3769102	380	A	0.52	And I think we have the same problem as we go up in scale.
3769166	3779240	381	A	0.99996	Also, we tend not to think of things like societies as living systems, but in one sense, they clearly are.
3780090	3791382	382	A	0.99	And to the extent that we can think of these structures that are much larger than we are individually as living systems, cognitive systems, et cetera.
3791446	3793900	383	A	1.0	I think we'll understand their dynamics better.
3795150	3796666	384	B	0.71534	Okay, final question.
3796848	3811680	385	B	0.52377	Upcycle Club wrote, how can a quantum system detect and respond to quantum context shifts switches, which are changes in the measurement basis or the entanglement structure of the system.
3814050	3814910	386	A	0.51297	Mmm.
3819760	3826040	387	A	0.99957	Well, the answer here is simple and not very informative.
3826120	3845940	388	A	0.99994	It's by making measurements, which is all that quantum systems can actually do, and making measurements that follow probing actions that try to push the boundaries of the model of a context.
3851240	3863992	389	A	0.99959	When having this discussion, I always like to go back to the frame problem in artificial intelligence, which is the problem formulated in the late sixty?
3864046	3869900	390	A	0.99938	S of predicting what won't change is the result of an action.
3870400	3874300	391	A	0.99997	So it's sort of the inverse of the problem of predicting the side effects.
3875120	3879712	392	A	0.5	And if you could predict all of the side effects, you can predict what doesn't change.
3879766	3883420	393	A	0.99999	So it's equivalent to the question of predicting all the side effects.
3883580	3894630	394	A	1.0	And context change is a side effect, and it's often an unobserved and maybe unobservable side effect.
3895320	3915050	395	A	0.99996	But if you have a model that says, I'm working in this context, then you can intentionally probe the boundaries of that model and see if you can actually alter the context you're in as a way of discovering what context you're in.
3915420	3919550	396	A	0.99	And humans do that in social settings all the time.
3922080	3931692	397	A	0.84035	But I think this is something that we need to think about happening at many different scales.
3931836	3934930	398	A	1.0	I suspect that cells are doing this all the time.
3935540	3937170	399	A	0.88	We just don't know how.
3941210	3942742	400	B	0.99997	There's so much to say there.
3942796	3952380	401	B	0.97788	It just makes me think of the paradox or the tension between expecting the expected, expecting the unexpected, and life needing to expect both of that.
3953070	3953820	402	A	0.9375	Right.
3954830	3956422	403	B	0.99614	So thank you, Chris.
3956486	3958054	404	B	0.99988	It's been an amazing lecture series.
3958102	3971490	405	B	0.99999	Many people in the live chat are very appreciative, and we'll look forward to their submitted questions and their participation in the final discussion coming soon.
3971640	3972846	406	B	0.99839	So thank you, Chris.
3972958	3974258	407	A	0.9275	Till next time, okay?
3974344	3975394	408	A	0.97	And thank you all.
3975512	3975854	409	A	0.8648	Bye.
3975902	3976110	410	A	0.62421	Ciao.
