1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,870
You.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,532
Hello and welcome, everyone. It is

3
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:14,820
October 12, 2023, and we are in

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,236
the final lecture, session six in

5
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:21,284
Physics's information processing with

6
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:23,764
Chris Fields. So, Chris, thank you for

7
00:00:23,802 --> 00:00:26,692
this journey. Exciting to get to this

8
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:29,416
final lecture, which will be followed

9
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:32,636
only by the last discussion for this go

10
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,636
around. So it's really awesome. And to

11
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:36,060
you for this lecture.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,476
Thank you, Daniel. And welcome,

13
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:43,756
everyone, to this last session that I'll

14
00:00:43,788 --> 00:00:47,200
be doing with a focus on biology.

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,936
And just to give a brief review.

16
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,536
As usual, we've focused

17
00:00:55,648 --> 00:00:58,064
in this course on generic quantum

18
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:02,548
systems, by which I mean just any

19
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:06,324
quantum system that has some number

20
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:09,512
of degrees of freedom. And we

21
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:12,900
really haven't made any assumptions

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,744
about these systems other than the

23
00:01:16,782 --> 00:01:19,216
assumption that both interacting

24
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:21,516
partners have sufficient degrees of

25
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:25,276
freedom that they can

26
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:28,460
be considered separable. So their

27
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,416
boundary is small with respect to the

28
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,204
total size of each of the interacting

29
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:37,564
systems. And I want to emphasize

30
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:39,824
again that the approach we've taken is

31
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:42,092
completely topological. So we haven't

32
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:44,372
assumed anything about embedding in

33
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:48,116
space. And as

34
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:50,532
we've characterized these systems, we

35
00:01:50,586 --> 00:01:53,270
focused really on two things.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,584
One, the amount of information that

37
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:02,424
the two systems can exchange. And that

38
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:05,016
amount is determined by the size of

39
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:07,592
their boundary. It's determined by this

40
00:02:07,646 --> 00:02:10,700
number, n, which is the Hilbert Space

41
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,592
dimension of the boundary. And as we've

42
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:15,196
discussed now in several of the

43
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,752
sessions, we can think of this boundary

44
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:21,148
as a collection of N qubits via which

45
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:24,000
the two systems, A and B, communicate.

46
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,848
The other feature of

47
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:32,992
the interaction on which we focused is

48
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:36,596
the reference frames that are used

49
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:40,004
by the two systems to interact with

50
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:42,020
this set of qubits. And it's these

51
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,524
reference frames that assign the

52
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:48,570
information that flows between A and B,

53
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,048
meaning or Functional significance or

54
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:57,130
actionability, or however you want to

55
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,924
refer to the idea that when

56
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:05,660
a system gets some information, it does

57
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,710
something useful with it.

58
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,384
So those are very generic kinds of

59
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:15,440
ways of characterizing an interaction.

60
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,380
You can think of it as a qualitative

61
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,216
characterization, the semantics of the

62
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:23,768
information, and a quantitative

63
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:25,604
characterization, the amount of

64
00:03:25,642 --> 00:03:28,704
information. But other than that, we've

65
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:31,910
left the nature of these systems open.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,244
And this characterization allowed us

67
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,724
to reformulate the free energy principle

68
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:42,330
in quantum information theoretic terms,

69
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,964
as the principle that interacting

70
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:47,480
systems behave in a way that will

71
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,944
asymptotically align their reference

72
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:54,172
frames. And we saw that full

73
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:56,764
alignment of reference frames is

74
00:03:56,802 --> 00:04:01,036
equivalent to entanglement. So the

75
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:03,900
FEP drives systems toward entanglement,

76
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,320
which is not surprising, because that's

77
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,404
what happens to generic quantum systems.

78
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:12,096
They may start out separable, but if

79
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,676
they interact long enough, they'll

80
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:17,844
become entangled. So we've had

81
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:21,076
a discussion that is really

82
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,540
very generic.

83
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,528
Now, we showed a couple of sessions ago

84
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:32,164
that under these very generic

85
00:04:32,212 --> 00:04:35,370
assumptions, we got some interesting

86
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,372
outcomes. And one is that if

87
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:41,804
systems have sufficient degrees of

88
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:45,336
freedom under the action

89
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:49,580
of the FEP, they will be driven toward

90
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,424
making a diverse set

91
00:04:53,462 --> 00:04:55,292
of measurements of their environment,

92
00:04:55,356 --> 00:04:56,624
because they're trying to get

93
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:58,864
information about it so that they can

94
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:02,528
predict what it's going to do. And that

95
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:05,564
as they add ways of making measurements,

96
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:08,210
they'll come up against our

97
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,620
noncommutativity of their measurements.

98
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,312
And this may be due to intrinsic

99
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:17,096
mathematical facts about their

100
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:18,776
measurements, and it may just be due to

101
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,890
their limited supply of free energy.

102
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,972
So either way, what this induces

103
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:29,852
is compartmentalization and the

104
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:32,040
requirement for internal, classical

105
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,340
communication on internal boundaries.

106
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,560
So I just wanted to reemphasize

107
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,716
that this is a result of basic physics.

108
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:45,936
And we see compartmentalization, of

109
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,080
course, ubiquitously in biology.

110
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,976
But this suggests to us that features

111
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:57,220
of biology that are very familiar

112
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,464
actually follow from fairly deep

113
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:04,004
physics, and compartmentalization is

114
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:07,480
one of them. We then talked

115
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,512
last time about space and time and

116
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:15,880
the computational requirements on

117
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,600
any system that is able to perceive

118
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,644
an external clock or perceive an

119
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:25,740
external spatial layout.

120
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,284
And we discussed this from

121
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:32,620
a very kind of developmental psychology

122
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,840
point of view. We discussed it using

123
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,696
essentially the kinds of terms on the

124
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:41,616
right here, as opposed to the

125
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:43,136
kind of language that's much more

126
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:45,172
technical and mathematical, that's used

127
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:49,792
in physics to derive

128
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:52,550
Spacetime as emergent from information

129
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,340
transactions.

130
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,744
But we at least hypothesize that both

131
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:03,112
of these are ways of getting to the same

132
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:05,400
sense of emergent Spacetime.

133
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,164
And one important outcome of this

134
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:12,152
discussion was that systems can perceive

135
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:15,464
external clocks, so external

136
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:18,312
periodic behavior with fewer

137
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:21,384
computational resources, so before

138
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:23,964
they're able to perceive spatial

139
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:27,168
layouts. And we'll get back to this

140
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:30,304
later. So,

141
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:33,052
organisms and maybe other complex

142
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:37,844
systems, seem to manage a

143
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:41,476
collection of capabilities that

144
00:07:41,498 --> 00:07:43,700
are all mutually dependent.

145
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,564
So memory depends

146
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:52,212
on having layouts of persistent

147
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:54,280
things that can be distinguished.

148
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,260
So it depends on space, and it certainly

149
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,750
depends on time.

150
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,352
Space gives structure to persistent

151
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:11,144
objects. Memory allows you to identify

152
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:14,844
persistent objects. And objects,

153
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:18,032
in turn, give structure to space by

154
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:20,480
being located in different places.

155
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,900
And objects enable the fundamental

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,044
requirement for memory, which is some

157
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:31,732
form of error correction, so that one

158
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:36,052
has enough redundancy in the memory to

159
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:38,856
check to see whether a memory has been

160
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:41,530
degraded. So,

161
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,396
organisms seem

162
00:08:45,428 --> 00:08:49,012
to manage a physically very

163
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:52,492
important process, which is the use of

164
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:56,584
Spacetime and memory as a basis

165
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:59,708
for cognition. You'll recognize these

166
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:02,572
four functions that are mutually

167
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:05,772
interdependent as underlying complex

168
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,256
cognition across the board. And you

169
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:11,852
can't really do complex cognition unless

170
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,920
you have these capabilities.

171
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,868
So today, we're going to put some of

172
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:21,332
these things together in a discussion of

173
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:24,900
biology and end by looking

174
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,264
forward to future directions, not just

175
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,564
in biology, but in all of quantum

176
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,010
information theory. So,

177
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,172
let's talk about biological systems,

178
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:39,804
living systems, which, of course,

179
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:43,404
includes us, but also includes all

180
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,404
other organisms and communities of

181
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:47,704
organisms and so forth, at multiple

182
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:51,196
scales. And I want to

183
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:55,680
put forward a fairly radical hypothesis

184
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,412
that living systems are just generic

185
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:04,012
quantum systems that the FEP has

186
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:06,448
driven to a high level of computational

187
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:10,484
complexity. So what does this really

188
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:14,436
say? It suggests that living systems are

189
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:17,976
just quantum systems that have enough

190
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,208
degrees of freedom and

191
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:25,060
a sufficiently complicated internal

192
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,280
dynamics that the FEP,

193
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,884
by requiring them to predict what their

194
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,196
environment is going to do next, has

195
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:37,592
driven them to make complicated

196
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:40,888
measurements and complicated inferences

197
00:10:40,984 --> 00:10:43,824
on the basis of those measurements that

198
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:46,496
enable fairly complicated actions on the

199
00:10:46,518 --> 00:10:49,456
environment. So these are systems that

200
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:53,436
you would characterize as computers,

201
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:55,536
essentially information processing

202
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:58,276
systems, with a high degree of

203
00:10:58,298 --> 00:11:02,052
computational capability. Now, this is

204
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,752
clearly as much a philosophical

205
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:07,568
hypothesis as an empirical hypothesis.

206
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:10,936
And that's due in part to the fact that

207
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,324
we don't really have a good definition

208
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:15,512
of what a living system is. We can just

209
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,672
point and say, that's a living system,

210
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:19,900
and that thing over there isn't.

211
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,956
But beyond that, we don't have much of a

212
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:25,356
theory. And, of course, people have

213
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:27,452
worked on a theory of what is life? For

214
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:28,380
decades,

215
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
but there's not a lot of agreement.

216
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,264
And so this

217
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:41,056
is, in a sense, a definitional kind

218
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:44,416
of hypothesis. And we test such kinds

219
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:46,496
of hypothesis by seeing if they're

220
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:49,284
useful conceptually to help us

221
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:51,012
understand what living systems are

222
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:54,596
doing. Now, as soon as we

223
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:56,132
put forward something like this,

224
00:11:56,186 --> 00:11:58,024
inevitably the question comes up, are

225
00:11:58,062 --> 00:12:00,420
living systems really quantum systems,

226
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,524
or are they classical in some intrinsic

227
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:06,984
sense? And this question is really

228
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:09,950
an artifact of two things. One,

229
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,628
the continuing association between

230
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:16,780
quantum systems and microscopic systems,

231
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,016
which is, of course, traditional.

232
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:21,824
Quantum theory, was developed to deal

233
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:24,320
with microscopic phenomena. It was first

234
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,676
tested as a theory of microscopic

235
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,192
phenomena. And it's only in the past

236
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:33,104
couple of decades that quantum theory is

237
00:12:33,142 --> 00:12:35,684
being applied to big things, to

238
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,430
cosmology, for example.

239
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,384
So there's a long tradition

240
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:46,256
of association between quantum and

241
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:48,424
microscopic. And living systems are

242
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:49,720
mesoscopic,

243
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,576
much bigger than atoms, bigger than

244
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:57,096
molecules, and they're not nearly as

245
00:12:57,118 --> 00:12:59,336
big as cosmological systems, so they're

246
00:12:59,368 --> 00:13:01,736
somewhere in between. And those systems

247
00:13:01,768 --> 00:13:03,404
have traditionally been regarded as

248
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:06,824
classical, and even chemistry

249
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:10,152
even biochemistry is still taught

250
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:13,392
in a very classical way. So we're not

251
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:15,152
used to thinking of these things as

252
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:18,416
quantum systems. But at

253
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:20,096
least in the approach we've taken in

254
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:23,584
this course, all physical systems are

255
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:25,552
quantum systems, and classical

256
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:28,304
information exists only on boundaries,

257
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,604
only on boundaries between systems, and

258
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:33,936
it only describes their interaction.

259
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:37,256
And I want to emphasize, I've said

260
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,410
it before, but since this is the last

261
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,256
class, I want to say it again, that this

262
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:45,690
is not a universally held view.

263
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,110
It's a view that's becoming more common.

264
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,516
And I think a generation from now it

265
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:59,756
will probably be the dominant view of

266
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:04,232
things. But it's

267
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:06,444
not fair to say that it's the dominant

268
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:09,136
view now. It's, I think, quite fair to

269
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:11,148
say that it's a view on the rise,

270
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:12,848
especially in the quantum information

271
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:16,212
and quantum gravity communities. But

272
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,740
from a strict empirical perspective,

273
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,270
we know a number of things. We know that

274
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,492
accurate molecular dynamics calculations

275
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:30,344
require quantum theory. We know that

276
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:33,592
a lot of biologically important

277
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:37,272
molecular processes use

278
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:40,012
quantum coherence. We know that things

279
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:42,524
like hydrogen bonding can only be

280
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:46,060
understood using quantum theory.

281
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,300
We know that cellular free energy

282
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,064
budgets are way too small to

283
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,064
support fully classical information

284
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:58,064
processing. If we think of information

285
00:14:58,182 --> 00:15:00,304
processing in terms of what proteins are

286
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:03,360
doing or what other molecules are doing

287
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,620
in terms of changing shape,

288
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,344
we know that shape changes in proteins

289
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:11,604
and other molecules underlie all

290
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:14,596
cellular information processing. So if

291
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:15,908
we think of them as actually

292
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:17,752
implementing cellular information

293
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:19,944
processing, we have way more information

294
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:22,004
processing than could be funded

295
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:25,144
classically. And finally, we know that

296
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:28,276
human cognition exhibits contextuality.

297
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:31,544
So human cognition uses quantum

298
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:35,512
coherence. It's not a classical causal

299
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:37,820
process in all cases,

300
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,130
but this is still a very nascent field,

301
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,816
and it's a field with a lot of

302
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:46,896
potential. And I think again, a

303
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:50,304
generation from now, quantum biology is

304
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:52,064
going to be regarded as a very

305
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:55,264
mainstream endeavor, even though it's

306
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:59,152
something of a small emerging

307
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:02,564
field now. And I'll just show

308
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:05,812
you one picture in support of this third

309
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:06,470
point.

310
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,920
This is a plot of measured

311
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,352
free energy usage converted to numbers

312
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:21,164
of bits processed at one kHz for

313
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:24,472
a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic

314
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:27,564
cells. All that I could find a few years

315
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:30,296
ago that had good calliometric

316
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:33,632
measurements versus the log of their

317
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:37,250
area, their membrane surface area.

318
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,944
And the thing to note here is that these

319
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:42,684
cells are processing classical

320
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:45,316
information at pretty low rates, KHz to

321
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,356
gigahertz rates, for 1000 bits at a

322
00:16:48,378 --> 00:16:51,844
time. And we know that a lot more

323
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:55,430
is happening in cells than that.

324
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,884
Cells have many more than 1000 proteins,

325
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:01,144
and those proteins are all moving all

326
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:04,104
the time. And if that motion is

327
00:17:04,142 --> 00:17:07,080
processing information, then there's not

328
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,776
nearly enough classical, not nearly

329
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:13,996
enough thermodynamic power to power all

330
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:15,980
of that information processing.

331
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,984
So let's now talk a little bit about

332
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:27,010
life and living systems and

333
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,850
what they look like.

334
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,848
Here's a view of living systems from the

335
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:35,284
point of view of genome diversity. This

336
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:38,052
is a few years old, so it's out of date

337
00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:40,660
by now, but it tells us a lot

338
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,020
qualitatively.

339
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,396
It tells us that almost all genome

340
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:48,600
diversity is microbial,

341
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,044
that the sorts of organisms that we're

342
00:17:53,092 --> 00:17:55,876
familiar with, medium sized organisms

343
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,740
like us, animals and plants, have only a

344
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,844
tiny amount of genome diversity. So we

345
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,432
think of ourselves as pretty diverse.

346
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:07,900
We think of ourselves as quite different

347
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,792
from other animals, from flies or worms

348
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,624
or sponges or something like that.

349
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:16,832
But in fact, we're not all that

350
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:19,104
different from them. We share many,

351
00:18:19,142 --> 00:18:20,944
many proteins with all of those other

352
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:23,276
organisms. We share the same cellular

353
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:26,500
organization and so forth. We're not,

354
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,900
in fact, all that different from plants,

355
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,996
and we're much more similar to

356
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:34,980
the fungi than to the plants.

357
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,208
So we get a very biased view of

358
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:41,448
genome diversity when we just look at

359
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:45,000
familiar, large types of living systems.

360
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,664
Most genome diversity is buried down

361
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:50,510
there in the microbial world.

362
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,148
This isn't the only way we can look at

363
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:59,608
life as a diverse set of organisms.

364
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:02,304
We can also look at it in terms of a

365
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:05,824
cell lineage. The fact that we're all

366
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:10,176
related at the DNA level tells us that

367
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,880
we're all descendants of a common

368
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,036
ancestor, which is usually called LUCA,

369
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:17,600
the last universal common ancestor.

370
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,324
And LUCA is generally modeled as being a

371
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:25,860
cell, more or less like

372
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,890
a bacterial cell. So fairly simple,

373
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,952
with not very many pathways, with maybe

374
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,024
a DNA genome. And if LUCA didn't have

375
00:19:36,062 --> 00:19:39,304
one, then they arose fairly shortly

376
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,468
thereafter, because all organisms that

377
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:45,484
we know of have DNA genomes. But the

378
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:49,100
point of looking at life as a lineage

379
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,424
is that we get a diagram that looks very

380
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:56,720
much like the cell lineage from an

381
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,424
embryological situation, much like the

382
00:19:59,462 --> 00:20:02,636
cell lineage of our own bodies growing

383
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,820
from a fertilized egg.

384
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,812
And in particular, looking at life

385
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:13,284
as a lineage shows us that not only do

386
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:17,052
we share DNA with all other organisms,

387
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:21,188
we actually share a membrane cytoplasm

388
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:24,376
that's continuous in time all the way

389
00:20:24,398 --> 00:20:27,880
back to Leuka, and so continuous in time

390
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,100
between us and bacteria.

391
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,068
So if you look at life this way, you

392
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:38,044
realize that life is, in a sense, all

393
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:41,892
one organism, all one connected

394
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:45,696
structure that's developed over time

395
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:49,968
through division, cell division. And so

396
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:54,256
we are very closely related to

397
00:20:54,358 --> 00:20:57,436
all other parts of life in the same way

398
00:20:57,478 --> 00:20:59,812
that different cells in our bodies are

399
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:02,356
closely related to each other. The time

400
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:04,164
span is just longer. I mean, here the

401
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:06,744
time span is three and a half or 4

402
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:10,024
billion years between us

403
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:13,412
and LUCA. These lineages

404
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:15,976
have been diverging for that long, but

405
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:18,136
they're still continuous. And in

406
00:21:18,158 --> 00:21:21,452
particular, they form

407
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:26,076
a continuous cell membrane. So when

408
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:28,524
you think of life in this way, we

409
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:32,224
realize that we are reasoning from just

410
00:21:32,262 --> 00:21:33,872
one example when we think about

411
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:37,452
terrestrial life. And this strongly

412
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:39,600
limits what we can say about living

413
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,000
systems, what we can say about biology,

414
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,330
that we really only have one example,

415
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,876
the lineage that descends from LUCA here

416
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:52,564
on Earth. And at some point, we may have

417
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,740
more examples. And there's certainly

418
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,908
groups working on artificial organisms

419
00:21:57,924 --> 00:22:00,264
that aren't part of this Lineage, that

420
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:03,416
are constructed from parts derived from

421
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,576
this Lineage, but aren't members of this

422
00:22:05,598 --> 00:22:08,696
Lineage themselves. And that may tell us

423
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:10,270
something new about life.

424
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,190
But if we think of life this way,

425
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,496
we see something very important, which

426
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:24,812
is that as life Grows, its boundary

427
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,080
gets bigger.

428
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,944
And since the boundary of a system

429
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:32,924
constitutes its informational

430
00:22:32,972 --> 00:22:33,920
environment,

431
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,892
its dimension getting bigger means

432
00:22:39,946 --> 00:22:42,916
that more information flows into it from

433
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:45,332
its environment and more information

434
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:48,440
flows out of it into its environment.

435
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,140
So as life develops from LUCA,

436
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,092
it gets a larger and larger

437
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:57,832
informational environment, and this

438
00:22:57,886 --> 00:22:59,884
dimension of its boundary grows and

439
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:03,964
grows. Now, what that means, if you go

440
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:06,124
back to our original picture of two

441
00:23:06,162 --> 00:23:10,156
interacting systems, is that the

442
00:23:10,178 --> 00:23:11,852
dimensionality of the physical

443
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:15,696
environment is decreasing. And we think

444
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:17,472
of the physical environment as

445
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:19,296
increasing in size. We have the

446
00:23:19,318 --> 00:23:21,744
expanding universe and all that. But

447
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:23,970
what's increasing in size is space.

448
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,020
And if space is emergent,

449
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,572
then that increase is not a real

450
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:34,036
increase in degrees of freedom. What

451
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:36,856
we're really interested in is the

452
00:23:36,878 --> 00:23:38,612
Hilbert Space of the physical

453
00:23:38,676 --> 00:23:40,696
environment, as distinct from the

454
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:44,104
Hilbert space of life. And as

455
00:23:44,142 --> 00:23:47,144
life gets bigger, it literally qubits,

456
00:23:47,182 --> 00:23:49,216
literally eats the physical environment

457
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:51,736
and turns it into more life. So there's

458
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:53,710
less physical environment around.

459
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,148
So the trajectory of life is toward a

460
00:23:57,154 --> 00:23:59,324
bigger informational environment and a

461
00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:02,024
smaller physical environment. And as the

462
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:03,936
physical environment gets smaller, you

463
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,556
might imagine it gets easier to predict.

464
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:08,572
And as the Informational environment

465
00:24:08,636 --> 00:24:11,392
gets bigger, you have more information

466
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:13,888
with which to predict the behavior of

467
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:16,756
the physical environment. So this all

468
00:24:16,778 --> 00:24:18,644
hangs together very nicely with the free

469
00:24:18,682 --> 00:24:21,856
energy principle. Here's another picture

470
00:24:21,888 --> 00:24:25,124
of this same thing. If we

471
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:27,256
start with some boundary here on the

472
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,570
left labeled B, around some system

473
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,176
labeled S, and it's embedded in an

474
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:36,520
environment, E. Then as

475
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:41,396
S makes copies of itself through

476
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,500
some process like cell division,

477
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,516
then it starts to fill up more of E,

478
00:24:47,698 --> 00:24:50,156
it's actually converting degrees of

479
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:53,232
freedom of E into degrees of freedom of

480
00:24:53,286 --> 00:24:55,810
its copies that it's made of itself.

481
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,372
And if we think of some larger boundary

482
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:02,144
drawn somewhere in E, here on the right

483
00:25:02,182 --> 00:25:05,444
side, I've labeled that B prime. What

484
00:25:05,482 --> 00:25:08,304
happens is that B prime gets slowly

485
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,750
filled up with copies of S,

486
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,148
and it starts to look like a large

487
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:18,024
organism. And that's what life is doing

488
00:25:18,062 --> 00:25:20,792
in the physical environment. It's making

489
00:25:20,846 --> 00:25:23,944
a bigger boundary for itself at the

490
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,152
expense of degrees of freedom of its

491
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:29,544
physical environment. So we can

492
00:25:29,582 --> 00:25:33,564
ask, what drives this process? Why is

493
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:35,864
life doing this? Why is it making copies

494
00:25:35,912 --> 00:25:39,244
of itself? And the answer to that

495
00:25:39,282 --> 00:25:40,844
question, at least one answer to that

496
00:25:40,882 --> 00:25:43,020
question, is the free energy principle

497
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,324
drives it to do this. And I'll

498
00:25:47,372 --> 00:25:51,424
just show you some simulations from

499
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:55,364
several years ago of a

500
00:25:55,402 --> 00:25:58,404
cell population. In this upper left

501
00:25:58,442 --> 00:26:01,424
panel, the green cells are stem cells

502
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:05,056
that divide, and they've been embedded

503
00:26:05,088 --> 00:26:07,496
in an environment that's safe on the

504
00:26:07,518 --> 00:26:10,616
left side and 100% lethal on the

505
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:14,104
right side. So they're embedded in an

506
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:17,944
environment that's conducive to life

507
00:26:17,982 --> 00:26:19,676
on one side and very dangerous as you

508
00:26:19,698 --> 00:26:23,724
get toward the middle. And the

509
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:27,560
purpose of these simulations

510
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,876
was to study what happens when the

511
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:34,720
stem cells are able to divide

512
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,560
and create not just other stem cells,

513
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,800
but create specialized progeny that

514
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,340
don't divide. So somatic progeny

515
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,964
that don't divide and hence have free

516
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:52,864
energy resources, thermodynamic

517
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,252
resources, that they can devote to doing

518
00:26:55,306 --> 00:26:57,400
something other than dividing.

519
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,980
Cell division is incredibly expensive

520
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,624
when it comes to energy. So if you take

521
00:27:03,662 --> 00:27:06,952
that energy and apply it not to cell

522
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:10,424
division, but to protecting the stem

523
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:11,340
cells,

524
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,912
you can allow the stem cell population

525
00:27:15,976 --> 00:27:18,124
to expand. And that's what these other

526
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:21,132
simulations show. The blue cells are

527
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:23,916
somatic cells that have very varying

528
00:27:23,948 --> 00:27:26,240
ability to protect the stem cells.

529
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,836
And if they're fairly good at protection

530
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,050
and they're fairly hard to kill,

531
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,980
down in the right bottom Quadrant,

532
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,728
you can actually get a population

533
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,976
expanding well into the highly lethal

534
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:46,984
part of the environment. So this

535
00:27:47,022 --> 00:27:49,560
shows you the FEP in action.

536
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,664
What the stem cells are doing is

537
00:27:54,782 --> 00:27:57,668
constructing a very predictable

538
00:27:57,764 --> 00:28:00,524
neighborhood around themselves in the

539
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:04,408
environment by dividing to make progeny

540
00:28:04,504 --> 00:28:07,630
that don't themselves divide, that just

541
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,184
sit there and help protect

542
00:28:13,302 --> 00:28:15,696
the stem cells. So the stem cells are

543
00:28:15,718 --> 00:28:18,172
now living in a safer, more predictable

544
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:20,784
environment, and that allows them to

545
00:28:20,822 --> 00:28:23,880
invade more and more of their physical

546
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,664
environment by having this fairly

547
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:28,884
benign, informational environment. So

548
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:32,192
this is the FEP in action driving

549
00:28:32,256 --> 00:28:34,916
the expansion of life at the expense of

550
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:36,340
the physical environment.

551
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,650
So that lets us go back to this question

552
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,792
that was raised last time about the

553
00:28:46,846 --> 00:28:50,264
mechanism of these scale transitions

554
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,750
that we see ubiquitously in life.

555
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,652
Life gets bigger and bigger as

556
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:01,696
time goes on phytogenetically and as

557
00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:05,312
time goes on developmentally, we start

558
00:29:05,366 --> 00:29:08,608
with some molecular pathways that

559
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:11,248
somehow get assembled into a cell.

560
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:13,296
That's the origin of life question, how

561
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:18,452
does that happen? And about

562
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,876
2 billion years later, cells start to

563
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:23,840
group together to make multicellular

564
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,192
organisms. Now, bacteria group together

565
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:29,700
to make facultative multicellular

566
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,884
systems like microbial maps. 3 billion

567
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:35,210
years ago, very, very early on.

568
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,692
But we don't see the emergence of

569
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:41,676
obligate multicellulars until much,

570
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:45,352
much later, before the Cambrian

571
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,144
explosion, but still less than a billion

572
00:29:47,192 --> 00:29:50,444
years ago. And from there, things get

573
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:55,904
more complicated very quickly. So one

574
00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:58,880
has large multicellular organisms.

575
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,840
They develop complicated social

576
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,952
relations that probably first emerged

577
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:09,796
with social insects, but are

578
00:30:09,818 --> 00:30:11,220
certainly well developed in

579
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,700
invertebrates, including in mammals.

580
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,344
Organisms group together in

581
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:27,412
very complex ecosystems. And recall

582
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:30,716
here that it's now known that all

583
00:30:30,818 --> 00:30:33,912
multicellular organisms have obligate

584
00:30:33,976 --> 00:30:36,764
microbial symbiotes. So all of our

585
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:38,940
bodies are, in fact, very complex

586
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,824
ecosystems populated by many, many

587
00:30:41,862 --> 00:30:44,256
different species of bacteria. And

588
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:46,336
that's true not just for us, but for

589
00:30:46,438 --> 00:30:49,244
trees and insects and worms and sponges

590
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:57,760
and everything else. So organisms,

591
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,384
from a body point of view, are

592
00:31:00,422 --> 00:31:03,520
themselves ecosystems. And organisms

593
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,040
organize themselves into ecosystems,

594
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,230
and these ecosystems come into contact

595
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,376
across the entire biosphere.

596
00:31:13,568 --> 00:31:17,252
So processes as simple

597
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:21,304
as the wind disperse organisms as

598
00:31:21,342 --> 00:31:24,840
small as bacteria all over the planet.

599
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,388
So this scaling

600
00:31:30,564 --> 00:31:33,104
of life toward larger and larger

601
00:31:33,172 --> 00:31:36,716
organizational structures is, in a

602
00:31:36,738 --> 00:31:39,372
sense, the major thing for biology to

603
00:31:39,426 --> 00:31:42,956
explain. And the

604
00:31:42,978 --> 00:31:46,512
hypothesis that we floated last time was

605
00:31:46,566 --> 00:31:50,748
that this transition

606
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:53,504
from very small scales to very large

607
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:56,256
scales uses the same mechanism over and

608
00:31:56,278 --> 00:31:59,772
over again, or a mechanism

609
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:02,144
that has the same structure over and

610
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:05,536
over again. So the

611
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:08,156
renormalization group is trivial.

612
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:10,612
Basically, it's just the identity

613
00:32:10,716 --> 00:32:13,380
operating at different scales or mapping

614
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,536
from one scale to the next. So the

615
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:19,144
question is, can we approach this in any

616
00:32:19,182 --> 00:32:21,770
way? Does this make sense?

617
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,350
And to try to make sense of it,

618
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,976
we can go to the R1 developed

619
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:33,310
theory that we have in biology, which

620
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,916
has been formulated by Dawkins and

621
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:38,160
others as universal Darwinism.

622
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,970
This is just kind of an abstraction of

623
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,444
the modern synthesis between Darwinian

624
00:32:46,572 --> 00:32:48,480
evolution and genetics.

625
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,192
But universal Darwinism is incredibly

626
00:32:52,256 --> 00:32:55,540
simple and very obvious. It says

627
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,664
if you have systems and they can copy

628
00:32:57,712 --> 00:32:59,588
each other, they can copy themselves,

629
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:02,936
and the copies can diversify. Then if

630
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,232
you want to know what's going to happen

631
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:05,930
at the population level,

632
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,512
what you will find is the systems that

633
00:33:09,566 --> 00:33:11,832
copy themselves and diversify most

634
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:14,156
efficiently will win because there'll be

635
00:33:14,178 --> 00:33:16,504
more of them, so they end up dominating

636
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:17,660
the population,

637
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,144
and winning gets called natural

638
00:33:23,192 --> 00:33:27,040
selection. But natural selection is not

639
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,112
an extra part of the Darwinian process.

640
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:33,936
It's just the outcome of efficiency of

641
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:37,472
the systems that copy themselves most

642
00:33:37,526 --> 00:33:41,092
efficiently, coming to dominate any

643
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:44,710
population. So there's no sort of

644
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,932
kind of hand of god or whatever,

645
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,656
reaching down and selecting some

646
00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:52,760
organisms and not others. And of course,

647
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,476
when Darwin put the idea of natural

648
00:33:55,508 --> 00:33:58,632
selection together, he was thinking very

649
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:02,404
explicitly of the analogy of a gardener

650
00:34:02,452 --> 00:34:06,616
or a farmer selecting the crops

651
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:09,260
or the animals or whatever that the

652
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,030
gardener liked best, and keeping those.

653
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,584
And that's where this selection metaphor

654
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,736
comes from. But there's no real process

655
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:20,384
of selection in evolution by

656
00:34:20,422 --> 00:34:22,736
natural selection. It's just copying and

657
00:34:22,758 --> 00:34:26,128
diversifying. But this

658
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:28,276
clearly is just the outline of what a

659
00:34:28,298 --> 00:34:30,630
real mechanistic theory would be,

660
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,550
because we need to have a story

661
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,940
about what copying is and what

662
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,636
diversifying is and what efficiently

663
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:42,410
means.

664
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,944
And in particular, to address the

665
00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:49,544
question that we raised a couple of

666
00:34:49,582 --> 00:34:52,072
slides ago, we need to know whether

667
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:56,268
these mechanisms are the same, or at

668
00:34:56,274 --> 00:34:59,932
least isomorphic, of the same form at

669
00:34:59,986 --> 00:35:04,536
different scales. So that's

670
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:06,800
what I want to talk about for the next

671
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:07,810
little bit.

672
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,980
Let's start with copying.

673
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,490
Up until the 70s,

674
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,840
copying in biology really meant DNA

675
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,764
replication and, to some

676
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:32,676
extent, cell division. But the focus in

677
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:34,532
evolutionary theory was on DNA

678
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:38,650
replication. And in the 70s,

679
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,764
it was realized that whole genes

680
00:35:43,812 --> 00:35:45,764
could be duplicated, so whole genes

681
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:50,140
could be copied. And then

682
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,564
shortly after that, it was realized that

683
00:35:53,602 --> 00:35:55,852
particularly in prokaryotes, where

684
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:59,024
genes, functionally related genes are

685
00:35:59,062 --> 00:36:00,700
next to each other in chromosomes,

686
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,520
often in what are called operons,

687
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,216
that operons could be duplicated and

688
00:36:07,238 --> 00:36:09,680
so entire pathways could be duplicated.

689
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,100
And as genomes began to be sequenced and

690
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,580
structures of genomes were understood,

691
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,964
it became clear that genomes could be

692
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:22,996
copied. And of

693
00:36:23,018 --> 00:36:25,896
course, we have two copies in each of

694
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:28,264
our cells, with the exception of red

695
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:31,960
blood cells of our complete genome.

696
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,672
But some plants, for example, have six

697
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,436
or eight or even more copies of their

698
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:40,204
genome in each of their cells. So

699
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:43,260
there's large scale genome duplication.

700
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,164
Cell division is clonal duplication of

701
00:36:47,202 --> 00:36:52,112
cells. Organismal reproduction works

702
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:55,200
by cell division. In all known systems,

703
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,652
colonies or societies of organisms

704
00:37:00,716 --> 00:37:03,588
reproduce themselves, in part through

705
00:37:03,674 --> 00:37:07,190
cultural transmission, and entire

706
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,596
niches reproduce themselves, for

707
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:14,730
example, in processes like

708
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,504
forest evolution or desertification, or

709
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:22,804
even urbanizaTion. We see humans

710
00:37:22,852 --> 00:37:25,512
reproducing the same sorts of niches in

711
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:27,470
city after city, for example.

712
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,612
So these forms of copying have

713
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:36,312
the kind of hierarchical dependencies

714
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:38,804
that one might expect. So to duplicate

715
00:37:38,872 --> 00:37:41,120
pathways, you have to duplicate genes.

716
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,336
To duplicate cells, you have to

717
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:47,244
duplicate the genome. To duplicate

718
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:49,760
organisms, you have to duplicate cells.

719
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,816
And this suggests that this copying

720
00:37:52,848 --> 00:37:55,910
operation is indeed scale free,

721
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,416
that the copying

722
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,676
operation at each level enables the

723
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,970
copying operation at the next level.

724
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,192
Now, with diversification, we see much

725
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:14,376
the same thing in

726
00:38:14,398 --> 00:38:17,740
the early days of the modern synthesis

727
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,252
and still in the work of people like

728
00:38:22,306 --> 00:38:26,460
Richard Dawkins. Diversification is

729
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,280
generally thought of as random. So

730
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,536
mutation, for example, is thought of as

731
00:38:31,558 --> 00:38:35,424
random. And here

732
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:37,648
I have Barbara McClintock, who is kind

733
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:41,490
of the hero of non randomness in

734
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,164
doggedly over decades, pointing out that

735
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:48,644
much of genome diversification is not

736
00:38:48,682 --> 00:38:54,632
random at all, and that

737
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:57,960
genomes actively diversify by moving

738
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,770
whole clusters of genes around and

739
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,984
duplicating them, or just changing their

740
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:07,372
positions so that they're under the

741
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:10,590
influence of different local control.

742
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,830
So at the gene and genome level,

743
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,004
you have active diversification by

744
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:22,772
various processes, enzymatic processes.

745
00:39:22,936 --> 00:39:25,244
As McClintock showed us, transposon

746
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:27,136
mediated mechanisms, which are

747
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:29,330
enzymatic. At the bottom,

748
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,756
cells actively diversify by lots of

749
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:38,884
different mechanisms. And in the

750
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:42,870
70s, Carl Woes was

751
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,884
in part large, personally responsible

752
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:49,524
for pointing out that in the microbial

753
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:53,144
world there's a lot of gene transfer.

754
00:39:53,262 --> 00:39:56,428
And again, no one believed him for quite

755
00:39:56,434 --> 00:39:59,336
a while. But now it's broadly accepted

756
00:39:59,368 --> 00:40:03,452
that microbes exchange DNA very

757
00:40:03,506 --> 00:40:06,744
frequently and across large distances

758
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:10,464
phylogenetically. And this is how

759
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:13,932
things like microbial resistance

760
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:17,664
to antibiotics spread so quickly, or one

761
00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:20,956
way that it spreads so quickly. And it's

762
00:40:20,988 --> 00:40:24,630
a tremendous agent of

763
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,264
essentially speciation to the extent

764
00:40:27,312 --> 00:40:29,108
that that even makes any sense in the

765
00:40:29,114 --> 00:40:32,452
microbial world. Of course,

766
00:40:32,506 --> 00:40:34,996
in our cells we have functional

767
00:40:35,028 --> 00:40:36,200
differentiation.

768
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,096
As mentioned earlier, there are lots of

769
00:40:41,118 --> 00:40:44,392
symbiotic interactions that lead

770
00:40:44,446 --> 00:40:47,848
to diversification in cells by radically

771
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:50,844
altering their local environments. And

772
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:53,036
of course, sex is a mechanism for

773
00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:53,900
diversification.

774
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,944
Organisms actively diversify in many

775
00:40:58,982 --> 00:41:00,656
different ways. The most obvious one is

776
00:41:00,678 --> 00:41:02,768
just by moving around, by moving to a

777
00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:06,000
different environment, the organism is

778
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,704
exposed to different inputs and is

779
00:41:08,742 --> 00:41:12,964
allowed different outputs, and so it

780
00:41:13,002 --> 00:41:14,900
can move into a different direction,

781
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,500
morphologically, genetically, et cetera.

782
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,444
Organisms can regulate their own

783
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:24,900
evolvability by altering things like DNA

784
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,492
repair systems or activating

785
00:41:27,556 --> 00:41:31,416
transposons. Again, these are sorts of

786
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:34,936
things that went very

787
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:36,524
much against the grain when they were

788
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:38,412
first discovered, but are now pretty

789
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:40,844
well accepted. And of course,

790
00:41:40,882 --> 00:41:43,660
urorganism can learn and so can

791
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:46,424
diversify their behavior by diversifying

792
00:41:46,472 --> 00:41:50,032
their computational capabilities. And

793
00:41:50,086 --> 00:41:51,916
social groups, of course, actively

794
00:41:51,948 --> 00:41:54,930
diversify in many different ways.

795
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,172
And organisms are increasingly,

796
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:02,880
non human organisms are increasingly

797
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,492
regarded as having cultures that they

798
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:08,308
pass on intergenerationally by

799
00:42:08,394 --> 00:42:11,652
intergenerational learning and can

800
00:42:11,706 --> 00:42:14,440
exchange with other groups.

801
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:19,672
So diversification is active and

802
00:42:19,726 --> 00:42:21,560
occurs at every scale.

803
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,816
And, again, diversity, although this

804
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:28,156
is a bit less clear than in the case of

805
00:42:28,258 --> 00:42:32,504
copying. Diversification mechanisms

806
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:34,776
at one scale enable diversification

807
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:36,780
mechanisms at other scales.

808
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,444
So, for example, transpose,

809
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:46,844
unmediated mechanisms enable horizontal

810
00:42:46,892 --> 00:42:49,680
gene transfer in microorganisms.

811
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:57,998
And the FEP tells us that efficiency

812
00:42:58,174 --> 00:43:00,530
is actually about intelligence,

813
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,962
because the FEP drives systems to build

814
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:07,654
good models of their environments or the

815
00:43:07,692 --> 00:43:10,486
behavior of their environments. And what

816
00:43:10,508 --> 00:43:14,040
a good model lets a system do is

817
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,062
reach a single goal by many different

818
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:20,218
means, because it allows, in a sense,

819
00:43:20,304 --> 00:43:21,130
planning,

820
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,306
and it allows flexibility and

821
00:43:25,328 --> 00:43:28,422
adaptability. And I put William James

822
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:31,966
here on this slide because he was the

823
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:33,914
first, as far as I know, to define

824
00:43:33,962 --> 00:43:36,302
intelligence as this ability to use

825
00:43:36,356 --> 00:43:38,590
different means to reach the same goal.

826
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,142
Now, in evolution, that's long been

827
00:43:42,196 --> 00:43:45,326
known, and it's called convergent

828
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:48,210
evolution, when you see two lineages

829
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,450
adapting to a single environment with

830
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,402
very different genetics and very

831
00:43:54,456 --> 00:43:59,862
different morphologies, and often

832
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:01,670
the organisms will end up with similar

833
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,454
morphologies that work well in that

834
00:44:04,492 --> 00:44:06,594
environment, but very different genetics

835
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:09,930
and very different biochemistry. So

836
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,882
throughout evolution, we see this

837
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:14,330
phenomenon of functional convergence,

838
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,994
balancing structural divergence at many,

839
00:44:18,032 --> 00:44:20,634
many different levels. So we have

840
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:23,070
multiple genes for very similar

841
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,654
proteins. We have multiple pathways that

842
00:44:26,692 --> 00:44:30,654
do more or less the same thing. We have

843
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:33,946
different cell types that support the

844
00:44:33,988 --> 00:44:37,522
same basic functions. We have

845
00:44:37,576 --> 00:44:40,740
tissues that are fairly different,

846
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,234
but that have the same functions, for

847
00:44:43,272 --> 00:44:45,506
example, eyes and different kinds of

848
00:44:45,528 --> 00:44:48,214
organisms that allow vision, but have

849
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,198
very different structure. And, of

850
00:44:50,204 --> 00:44:51,986
course, we have functional convergence

851
00:44:52,018 --> 00:44:55,206
and social relations. And if we look at

852
00:44:55,228 --> 00:44:56,790
how cells interact,

853
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,602
traditional evolutionary theory really

854
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,410
focuses on competition.

855
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:07,782
But we now know that cells cooperate,

856
00:45:07,846 --> 00:45:10,262
that they exchange resources in various

857
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:14,670
ways, even across vast differences

858
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,822
in phylogeny, for example, the

859
00:45:17,876 --> 00:45:20,378
interchange between plants and fungi,

860
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:22,880
or between bacteria and us.

861
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,930
We know that cells, in a sense,

862
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,074
persuade each other by secreting things

863
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:33,106
like hormones, that cause other cells to

864
00:45:33,128 --> 00:45:34,180
do different things.

865
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:40,358
Cells deceive each other, for example,

866
00:45:40,444 --> 00:45:42,166
microbes that are trying to escape the

867
00:45:42,188 --> 00:45:45,878
immune system, and cells coerce each

868
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:47,734
other. Cells even kill each other when

869
00:45:47,772 --> 00:45:50,694
they detect, for example, genetic

870
00:45:50,742 --> 00:45:54,618
defects. So these sorts of

871
00:45:54,704 --> 00:45:57,450
social and economic and even political

872
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,662
ideas are useful for describing living

873
00:46:01,716 --> 00:46:05,390
systems from the level of cells on up.

874
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:09,070
They were developed in social settings

875
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,102
to describe what goes on in human

876
00:46:11,156 --> 00:46:13,214
societies and then extended to other

877
00:46:13,252 --> 00:46:16,446
animals. And now it's

878
00:46:16,478 --> 00:46:18,434
very clear that they extend to

879
00:46:18,472 --> 00:46:21,938
individual cells. So when we think about

880
00:46:22,024 --> 00:46:25,250
social intelligence. We can think about

881
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,494
social intelligence even at the level of

882
00:46:27,532 --> 00:46:31,634
individual cells. And we see these sorts

883
00:46:31,682 --> 00:46:34,834
of competition, cooperation, resource

884
00:46:34,882 --> 00:46:36,934
exchange, et cetera, even at the level

885
00:46:36,972 --> 00:46:39,246
of microbial mats. So, biological

886
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:42,060
structures that are 3 billion years old.

887
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:45,354
Now, of course, intelligence is

888
00:46:45,392 --> 00:46:47,274
necessary, but it's not sufficient for

889
00:46:47,312 --> 00:46:49,722
being selected. It won't protect you

890
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:53,946
from impacts of asteroids

891
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,870
that happen to land on your planet,

892
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,206
which has happened often in the

893
00:46:58,228 --> 00:47:01,230
evolution of the Earth. And we're now

894
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,502
trying to figure out how to predict and

895
00:47:03,556 --> 00:47:08,110
prevent such things. But who knows

896
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,500
whether we'll be successful at that?

897
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:15,650
But this intelligence

898
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,742
is necessary when it's viewed in this

899
00:47:18,796 --> 00:47:21,894
FEP sort of way. Intelligence is what

900
00:47:21,932 --> 00:47:26,242
lets you build models that enable

901
00:47:26,306 --> 00:47:30,074
you to predict the environment. So where

902
00:47:30,112 --> 00:47:31,500
does this leave us?

903
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:37,434
By thinking of evolutionary theory in

904
00:47:37,472 --> 00:47:40,810
terms of scale free mechanisms,

905
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:45,726
we seem to have a picture in

906
00:47:45,748 --> 00:47:48,974
which we start with quantum systems with

907
00:47:49,012 --> 00:47:52,414
a certain level of complexity, and the

908
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,802
FEP actually gives us scale free

909
00:47:54,856 --> 00:47:57,474
biology, or something very close to

910
00:47:57,512 --> 00:48:01,426
scale free biology. And that's very

911
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:03,394
interesting, because the FEP, of course,

912
00:48:03,432 --> 00:48:05,762
is a generic principle. It just says

913
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,006
that systems do what they need to do to

914
00:48:08,028 --> 00:48:11,718
keep existing. And this

915
00:48:11,804 --> 00:48:13,350
way of thinking gives us some

916
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,946
predictions. One is that we'll

917
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:18,974
find compartmentalized problem solving

918
00:48:19,042 --> 00:48:22,262
everywhere, because the FEP

919
00:48:22,326 --> 00:48:26,026
drives compartmentalization. And the

920
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:28,298
reason is just non commutativity of

921
00:48:28,384 --> 00:48:31,718
measurement processes. It predicts that

922
00:48:31,744 --> 00:48:33,530
we'll see hierarchical organization

923
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,926
everywhere, in the same way we did on

924
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:39,034
that first compartmentalization slide,

925
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,214
where once you have a number of

926
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,418
compartments, you need a metacompartment

927
00:48:43,514 --> 00:48:45,474
that, if nothing else, distributes free

928
00:48:45,512 --> 00:48:47,614
energy. So some sort of very basic

929
00:48:47,662 --> 00:48:50,862
attention system. And we see attention

930
00:48:50,926 --> 00:48:53,170
systems, of course, throughout biology.

931
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,974
It predicts that living systems will

932
00:48:58,012 --> 00:49:00,662
have very limited classical data

933
00:49:00,716 --> 00:49:03,590
structures. So since they have to write

934
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,646
classical data on their boundaries, and

935
00:49:06,668 --> 00:49:08,294
their boundaries are much smaller than

936
00:49:08,332 --> 00:49:09,160
they are,

937
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,674
and because writing classical data is

938
00:49:13,712 --> 00:49:16,086
expensive, the living systems will tend

939
00:49:16,118 --> 00:49:18,666
to use as little classical data as they

940
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:22,302
can get away with, since classical data

941
00:49:22,356 --> 00:49:24,426
is needed for thermodynamic

942
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,942
irreversibility, where we see

943
00:49:26,996 --> 00:49:29,706
thermodynamic irreversibility, that's

944
00:49:29,738 --> 00:49:33,214
where we look for classical data. We saw

945
00:49:33,252 --> 00:49:35,374
that organisms will be able to detect

946
00:49:35,422 --> 00:49:38,658
time first before they can detect space.

947
00:49:38,824 --> 00:49:42,514
So we can expect organisms to have

948
00:49:42,552 --> 00:49:45,794
clocks even before they

949
00:49:45,832 --> 00:49:49,414
can represent space. And, of course,

950
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:51,602
we see things like diurnal variation

951
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:54,918
throughout biology. And finally,

952
00:49:55,084 --> 00:49:57,506
the FEP predicts this asymptotic

953
00:49:57,538 --> 00:50:00,218
collapse of separability back to

954
00:50:00,304 --> 00:50:04,410
entanglement. So it predicts that living

955
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,434
systems will eventually degrade and

956
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:09,194
become indistinguishable from their

957
00:50:09,232 --> 00:50:11,494
environments. And we know that happens

958
00:50:11,552 --> 00:50:13,358
at the cell level and the individual

959
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:17,390
organism level. We call it death.

960
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:22,414
So the FEP seems to give

961
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,690
us a lot of the features of biology,

962
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,586
and it gives us these features in a

963
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:31,618
scale free way, and it derives them from

964
00:50:31,704 --> 00:50:33,410
this very basic physics.

965
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:38,726
So where does that leave us? I think it

966
00:50:38,748 --> 00:50:41,990
leaves us here with a challenge

967
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:45,030
not just to thinking about the FEP,

968
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,734
which is what this course has been

969
00:50:47,772 --> 00:50:51,174
about, but to quantum

970
00:50:51,222 --> 00:50:52,940
information theory in general.

971
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:59,706
And that challenge is to evolve from

972
00:50:59,808 --> 00:51:01,694
the kind of contextuality and

973
00:51:01,732 --> 00:51:05,054
theoretical utility that we've been

974
00:51:05,092 --> 00:51:08,958
discussing in this course, and which is

975
00:51:09,044 --> 00:51:10,682
very well developed in the physics

976
00:51:10,746 --> 00:51:14,786
community, to some

977
00:51:14,808 --> 00:51:16,942
sorts of empirical and topological

978
00:51:17,006 --> 00:51:20,562
utility. And I've listed three

979
00:51:20,616 --> 00:51:24,462
areas here where QIt is very active,

980
00:51:24,606 --> 00:51:27,330
one in quantum gravity and cosmology.

981
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,694
And you're probably familiar with things

982
00:51:30,732 --> 00:51:34,342
like string theory that sort of

983
00:51:34,476 --> 00:51:36,966
fairly famously seem not to be

984
00:51:36,988 --> 00:51:40,826
empirically testable. And the

985
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,130
quantum gravity community is enormous,

986
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:45,994
many thousands of people working in this

987
00:51:46,032 --> 00:51:48,826
area. But coming up with theories that

988
00:51:48,848 --> 00:51:52,238
can be tested empirically at

989
00:51:52,324 --> 00:51:54,462
the scales that we can actually do

990
00:51:54,516 --> 00:51:56,910
experiments, so at accessible energy

991
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,566
scales, for example, has proved to be

992
00:51:59,588 --> 00:52:02,926
very difficult. So this is a

993
00:52:02,948 --> 00:52:06,930
real challenge to the field, is somehow

994
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,422
getting not just to empirical

995
00:52:09,486 --> 00:52:11,154
testability, but to some sort of

996
00:52:11,192 --> 00:52:14,226
technological utility. And you can

997
00:52:14,248 --> 00:52:16,254
imagine that if the. If the main

998
00:52:16,312 --> 00:52:19,366
prediction of quantum gravity is that

999
00:52:19,388 --> 00:52:24,694
Spacetime is emergent, that there

1000
00:52:24,732 --> 00:52:29,322
could be enormous utility in that some

1001
00:52:29,376 --> 00:52:31,862
ability to manipulate the way Spacetime

1002
00:52:31,926 --> 00:52:35,578
emerges. The second area, of course, is

1003
00:52:35,664 --> 00:52:38,746
quantum information and computing. And

1004
00:52:38,928 --> 00:52:41,114
here massive resources are being put

1005
00:52:41,152 --> 00:52:44,670
into technological utility.

1006
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,198
And I think it's reasonable to expect

1007
00:52:47,284 --> 00:52:49,514
that we'll have useful quantum computers

1008
00:52:49,562 --> 00:52:52,000
within a generation, at any rate.

1009
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,594
So there, I think the field

1010
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:59,714
is going quite well. And the last area,

1011
00:52:59,832 --> 00:53:01,726
what we've talked about here, is quantum

1012
00:53:01,758 --> 00:53:04,706
biochemistry and biology. And this, I

1013
00:53:04,728 --> 00:53:06,962
think, is an area with enormous practice

1014
00:53:07,106 --> 00:53:10,982
promise that maybe

1015
00:53:11,036 --> 00:53:13,480
some of you will actually contribute to

1016
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,150
making this area more useful topological

1017
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,370
and more accessible empirically.

1018
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:23,946
But at least we have a picture of how

1019
00:53:24,048 --> 00:53:26,060
these different areas fit together.

1020
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,586
So that's it. Thank you very much for

1021
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:32,400
participating in this class.

1022
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:55,534
Andrew will be doing your

1023
00:53:55,572 --> 00:53:58,146
questions. Sorry, could you just repeat

1024
00:53:58,178 --> 00:53:59,954
the last, like 30 seconds from. Andrew

1025
00:54:00,002 --> 00:54:03,430
will be Chris.

1026
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,480
Kick up. Andrew will be

1027
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,176
discussion session on Saturday, the 20

1028
00:54:16,198 --> 00:54:18,464
October at the usual time, 08:00 a.m.

1029
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:21,264
Pacific time. And the interactive Q and

1030
00:54:21,302 --> 00:54:23,344
A is open. I really appreciate your

1031
00:54:23,382 --> 00:54:27,172
questions. I try to answer them, and.

1032
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:30,596
Thank you very much. Awesome. Can I ask

1033
00:54:30,618 --> 00:54:31,956
a question, or do you want to call it

1034
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:35,364
here? Sure, go ahead.

1035
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:39,476
All right, Inks wrote,

1036
00:54:39,668 --> 00:54:42,808
Chris spoke last time introducing the

1037
00:54:42,814 --> 00:54:44,760
mechanisms of scale transition.

1038
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,584
I'll read your question, then I'll fix

1039
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:50,584
the cropping on the live stream. Chris

1040
00:54:50,632 --> 00:54:52,156
spoke last time introducing the

1041
00:54:52,178 --> 00:54:54,700
mechanisms of scale transition of these

1042
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:57,084
essentially semantic theories about how

1043
00:54:57,122 --> 00:55:00,156
one scale embeds in another scale. I

1044
00:55:00,178 --> 00:55:02,320
would love to learn more about this,

1045
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:04,604
especially in terms of natural language

1046
00:55:04,652 --> 00:55:06,572
semantics and human cognition.

1047
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,610
Semantics versus machine learning.

1048
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,640
Wow. Well, that's a very good question.

1049
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:16,590
Um,

1050
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,986
I think that's a very relevant question,

1051
00:55:22,088 --> 00:55:25,506
given the sorts of machine learning that

1052
00:55:25,528 --> 00:55:28,946
we see deployed in systems like chat

1053
00:55:28,978 --> 00:55:32,374
GPT, and especially as

1054
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,554
these systems start to associate

1055
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:37,720
language with images, for example,

1056
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:42,140
and as such systems are embedded in

1057
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,754
robotic systems that can actually move

1058
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:47,386
around in the world and interact with

1059
00:55:47,408 --> 00:55:48,490
real objects.

1060
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:52,894
I think one of the key questions in

1061
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,614
natural language semantics is, to what

1062
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,710
extent does it depend on reference?

1063
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:02,560
To what extent do

1064
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:08,626
the meanings we attach to words or

1065
00:56:08,728 --> 00:56:13,234
the usages that we allow

1066
00:56:13,432 --> 00:56:16,660
for words depend on

1067
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:20,422
our ability to connect words to

1068
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:24,390
external objects? And to what extent

1069
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:28,546
do those abilities rely

1070
00:56:28,578 --> 00:56:30,940
on connections between words themselves?

1071
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:35,254
So if you think of an LLM like chat GPT,

1072
00:56:35,382 --> 00:56:38,890
by itself, it's just a statistical model

1073
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,866
of relationships between words, as used

1074
00:56:41,968 --> 00:56:44,510
in some corpus of text, which is large,

1075
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:47,502
of course, but we can debate its

1076
00:56:47,556 --> 00:56:51,306
representativeness. And so that's

1077
00:56:51,338 --> 00:56:55,238
a model of semantics

1078
00:56:55,434 --> 00:56:57,742
that's entirely self contained. It's

1079
00:56:57,806 --> 00:57:01,042
entirely relations between different

1080
00:57:01,096 --> 00:57:04,114
pieces of language. Whereas when we

1081
00:57:04,152 --> 00:57:07,166
start to connect those words,

1082
00:57:07,288 --> 00:57:10,422
statistics, to images, or better yet,

1083
00:57:10,476 --> 00:57:14,034
to actual objects that are interacted

1084
00:57:14,082 --> 00:57:17,010
with not just visually, but haptically,

1085
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:20,186
for example, by a robot, they start to

1086
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,330
be connected to external reference.

1087
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:26,906
And that transition, I think,

1088
00:57:26,928 --> 00:57:29,034
is going to be very interesting to

1089
00:57:29,072 --> 00:57:32,220
watch. And it's just starting.

1090
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:37,182
So we all have ringside seats on

1091
00:57:37,316 --> 00:57:39,710
an incredible experiment in semantics.

1092
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:47,186
And so that

1093
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:49,874
would be my response, really, to that

1094
00:57:49,912 --> 00:57:53,122
question, is, keep your eyes on this

1095
00:57:53,176 --> 00:57:56,580
experiment and see how it goes,

1096
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:59,478
because it's bound to tell us something

1097
00:57:59,564 --> 00:58:04,130
about how semantics

1098
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:07,926
really works. And I suspect that there

1099
00:58:07,948 --> 00:58:11,114
will be enormous opportunity to start

1100
00:58:11,232 --> 00:58:13,610
relating the results of that experiment

1101
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:17,366
to what we see in developmental

1102
00:58:17,398 --> 00:58:18,860
psychology, for example.

1103
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:24,910
Wow. Awesome. All right, Tucker asks

1104
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:29,194
areas of macroscopic quantum mediated

1105
00:58:29,242 --> 00:58:31,786
phenomena in biology that get Chris

1106
00:58:31,818 --> 00:58:32,990
Fields excited.

1107
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,914
I think the one that excites me the most

1108
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:46,514
right now is just this

1109
00:58:46,632 --> 00:58:50,306
question of how cells

1110
00:58:50,338 --> 00:58:52,054
are managing to do the information

1111
00:58:52,172 --> 00:58:59,398
processing that they're doing and how

1112
00:58:59,484 --> 00:59:02,890
much of it they can accomplish.

1113
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,394
I think the right way to put it is how

1114
00:59:08,432 --> 00:59:10,218
can they get away with so little

1115
00:59:10,304 --> 00:59:11,580
classical information?

1116
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:17,134
And I don't think we have the cell

1117
00:59:17,172 --> 00:59:19,440
biology yet to answer that question.

1118
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:24,174
But I think asking the question may help

1119
00:59:24,212 --> 00:59:26,434
us design the right kinds of cell

1120
00:59:26,472 --> 00:59:28,420
biology to look for an answer.

1121
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,902
And our cell biology has been organized

1122
00:59:31,966 --> 00:59:35,982
around the idea that the structures

1123
00:59:36,046 --> 00:59:39,666
that we see are essentially static,

1124
00:59:39,778 --> 00:59:42,882
that they're classical, and that they're

1125
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:44,466
constructed in a way that's

1126
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:48,054
thermodynamically irreversible. But if

1127
00:59:48,092 --> 00:59:51,786
we think of what we measure as not

1128
00:59:51,968 --> 00:59:54,230
necessarily reflecting a static

1129
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:57,606
structure, I think we'll

1130
00:59:57,638 --> 01:00:01,110
start to conceptualize it differently

1131
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,038
and build models of it differently. I

1132
01:00:03,044 --> 01:00:04,414
mean, clearly, when we look at things

1133
01:00:04,452 --> 01:00:06,510
like protein structure,

1134
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:09,262
we're looking at snapshots of something

1135
01:00:09,316 --> 01:00:10,990
that's very dynamic.

1136
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:15,886
And when we look in a chemistry

1137
01:00:15,918 --> 01:00:18,562
textbook and we see pictures of this

1138
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:20,962
confirmation that changes to that

1139
01:00:21,016 --> 01:00:23,122
confirmation. We think of those as

1140
01:00:23,176 --> 01:00:24,958
static, stable structures, that that's

1141
01:00:24,974 --> 01:00:26,050
kind of a switch,

1142
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:31,618
but it's

1143
01:00:31,634 --> 01:00:34,054
not actually a switch the way a light

1144
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:36,994
switch is. It's a much more dynamic

1145
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:40,406
process. And the kinds

1146
01:00:40,438 --> 01:00:43,370
of molecular dynamic simulations that

1147
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,274
allow you to study that process are

1148
01:00:45,312 --> 01:00:47,722
incredibly complicated and time

1149
01:00:47,776 --> 01:00:51,318
expensive and uncertain due

1150
01:00:51,334 --> 01:00:54,350
to resolution problems and other things.

1151
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,662
But I think

1152
01:00:57,716 --> 01:01:01,486
thinking of these as kind

1153
01:01:01,508 --> 01:01:06,834
of fluid, reversible processes is

1154
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,354
going to change the way we think about

1155
01:01:08,392 --> 01:01:11,570
them. That's a great

1156
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,834
point. And it reminds me of the

1157
01:01:14,952 --> 01:01:17,874
more physics based way of thinking about

1158
01:01:17,912 --> 01:01:20,022
the paths that could happen between

1159
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,214
observations or the statistics based way

1160
01:01:22,332 --> 01:01:24,854
of samples of a dynamical process. And

1161
01:01:24,892 --> 01:01:27,814
in biology, we know that even if we take

1162
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:31,354
a snapshot, okay, this organism is 1,

1163
01:01:31,392 --> 01:01:33,286
it's 2 cm tomorrow, something changed.

1164
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:34,902
So we know there was a developmental

1165
01:01:35,046 --> 01:01:36,858
process, then we know there's an

1166
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:38,666
ecological process, and then there's an

1167
01:01:38,688 --> 01:01:41,930
evolutionary context. Eco Evo Devo.

1168
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:45,082
And then from that, more biological

1169
01:01:45,146 --> 01:01:49,390
understanding of contextual developing

1170
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:52,622
organisms. All of these different

1171
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:56,130
biological phenomena actually

1172
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,590
help us expand our space of measurement

1173
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:02,402
and analysis for material that

1174
01:02:02,456 --> 01:02:04,354
on one hand, some people may have called

1175
01:02:04,392 --> 01:02:09,494
inanimate, but then they have their

1176
01:02:09,532 --> 01:02:12,230
own dynamics, different timescales.

1177
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:16,486
And so bringing some of those, like the

1178
01:02:16,508 --> 01:02:18,722
challenges of measuring and observing,

1179
01:02:18,786 --> 01:02:22,330
intervening in historical and biological

1180
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:26,102
things, gives us a bigger understanding,

1181
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:28,694
even on measuring and summarizing,

1182
01:02:28,742 --> 01:02:32,634
analyzing ensembles or scales that don't

1183
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,286
immediately appear to have that kind of

1184
01:02:34,308 --> 01:02:38,014
historiosity, like pieces of silicon or

1185
01:02:38,052 --> 01:02:38,830
carbon.

1186
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:45,120
Yeah, that's well put. And I think

1187
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,562
we have the same problem as we go up in

1188
01:02:48,616 --> 01:02:51,586
scale. Also, we tend not to think of

1189
01:02:51,608 --> 01:02:54,130
things like societies as living systems,

1190
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:59,240
but in one sense, they clearly are.

1191
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:03,206
And to the extent that we can think of

1192
01:03:03,228 --> 01:03:05,026
these structures that are much larger

1193
01:03:05,058 --> 01:03:09,110
than we are individually as living

1194
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,382
systems, cognitive systems, et cetera.

1195
01:03:11,446 --> 01:03:13,222
I think we'll understand their dynamics

1196
01:03:13,286 --> 01:03:16,666
better. Okay, final question.

1197
01:03:16,848 --> 01:03:20,054
Upcycle Club wrote, how can a quantum

1198
01:03:20,102 --> 01:03:22,794
system detect and respond to quantum

1199
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:26,654
context shifts switches, which are

1200
01:03:26,772 --> 01:03:29,486
changes in the measurement basis or the

1201
01:03:29,508 --> 01:03:31,680
entanglement structure of the system.

1202
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:34,910
Mmm.

1203
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,260
Well, the answer

1204
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:46,040
here is simple and not very informative.

1205
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,124
It's by making measurements, which is

1206
01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:50,048
all that quantum systems can actually

1207
01:03:50,134 --> 01:03:54,640
do, and making

1208
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:57,840
measurements that follow probing actions

1209
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,656
that try to push the boundaries

1210
01:04:02,768 --> 01:04:05,940
of the model of a context.

1211
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,444
When having this discussion, I always

1212
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:16,232
like to go back to the frame problem in

1213
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:18,776
artificial intelligence, which is the

1214
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:23,124
problem formulated

1215
01:04:23,172 --> 01:04:27,352
in the late sixty? S of predicting what

1216
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:29,900
won't change is the result of an action.

1217
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,076
So it's sort of the inverse of the

1218
01:04:32,098 --> 01:04:34,300
problem of predicting the side effects.

1219
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,924
And if you could predict all of the side

1220
01:04:36,962 --> 01:04:39,372
effects, you can predict what doesn't

1221
01:04:39,436 --> 01:04:41,376
change. So it's equivalent to the

1222
01:04:41,398 --> 01:04:42,624
question of predicting all the side

1223
01:04:42,662 --> 01:04:45,584
effects. And context change is a side

1224
01:04:45,622 --> 01:04:51,768
effect, and it's often an unobserved

1225
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:54,630
and maybe unobservable side effect.

1226
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,576
But if you have a model that says, I'm

1227
01:04:58,608 --> 01:05:02,484
working in this context, then you

1228
01:05:02,522 --> 01:05:05,236
can intentionally probe the boundaries

1229
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:08,936
of that model and see if you

1230
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:11,848
can actually alter the context you're in

1231
01:05:11,934 --> 01:05:14,084
as a way of discovering what context

1232
01:05:14,132 --> 01:05:17,564
you're in. And humans do that

1233
01:05:17,602 --> 01:05:19,550
in social settings all the time.

1234
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,532
But I think this is something

1235
01:05:25,586 --> 01:05:29,424
that we need to think about happening

1236
01:05:29,622 --> 01:05:32,784
at many different scales. I suspect that

1237
01:05:32,822 --> 01:05:35,904
cells are doing this all the time. We

1238
01:05:35,942 --> 01:05:37,170
just don't know how.

1239
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:43,234
There's so much to say there. It just

1240
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:45,466
makes me think of the paradox or the

1241
01:05:45,488 --> 01:05:47,350
tension between expecting the expected,

1242
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:50,202
expecting the unexpected, and life

1243
01:05:50,336 --> 01:05:53,820
needing to expect both of that. Right.

1244
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:56,986
So thank you, Chris. It's been an

1245
01:05:57,008 --> 01:05:58,938
amazing lecture series. Many people in

1246
01:05:58,944 --> 01:06:01,334
the live chat are very appreciative,

1247
01:06:01,462 --> 01:06:04,874
and we'll look forward to their

1248
01:06:04,912 --> 01:06:06,682
submitted questions and their

1249
01:06:06,736 --> 01:06:10,270
participation in the final discussion

1250
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:13,278
coming soon. So thank you, Chris. Till

1251
01:06:13,294 --> 01:06:15,394
next time, okay? And thank you all.

1252
01:06:15,512 --> 01:06:15,854
Bye.
