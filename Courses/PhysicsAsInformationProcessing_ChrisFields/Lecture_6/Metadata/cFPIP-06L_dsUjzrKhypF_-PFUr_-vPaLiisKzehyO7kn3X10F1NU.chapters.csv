4320	39192	00:04	Final lecture, session six in Physics's information processing with Chris Fields. Exciting to get to this final lecture, followed only by the last discussion for this go around.	This is the final lecture in Physics's information processing with Chris Fields	The Physics of Information Processing
39256	364950	00:39	We've focused in this course on generic quantum systems, by which I mean just any quantum system that has some number of degrees of freedom. The amount of information that the two systems can exchange is determined by the size of their boundary. This suggests to us that features of biology that are very familiar follow from fairly deep physics.	We've focused in this course on generic quantum systems	Quantum Systems, their biology
366540	571880	06:06	We then talked last time about space and time and the computational requirements on any system that is able to perceive an external clock. Memory depends on having layouts of persistent things that can be distinguished. Space gives structure to persistent objects. And you can't really do complex cognition unless you have these capabilities.	We discussed the computational requirements on any system that can perceive external clocks	Understanding the foundations of complex cognition
573260	711670	09:33	Living systems are just generic quantum systems that the FEP has driven to a high level of computational complexity. This is clearly as much a philosophical hypothesis as an empirical hypothesis. We test such kinds of hypothesis by seeing if they're useful conceptually to help us understand what living systems are doing.	I put forward a radical hypothesis that living systems are just generic quantum systems	Living Systems, the computational complexity of life
712680	1035980	11:52	Are living systems really quantum systems, or are they classical in some intrinsic sense? There's a long tradition of association between quantum and microscopic. A generation from now, quantum biology is going to be regarded as a very mainstream endeavor.	Are living systems really quantum systems or are they classical in some intrinsic sense	Are living systems really quantum systems or classical?
1038240	1716340	17:18	Almost all genome diversity is microbial. We can also look at life in terms of a cell lineage. As life Grows, its boundary gets bigger. This means that more information flows into it from its environment. The trajectory of life is toward a bigger informational environment.	Looking at life as a lineage shows that its boundary gets bigger as it grows	Looking at life as a lineage
1718940	2107810	28:38	Life gets bigger and bigger as time goes on phytogenetically. This scaling of life toward larger and larger organizational structures is, in a sense, the major thing for biology to explain. To try to make sense of it, we can go to the theory of universal Darwinism.	This scaling of life toward larger and larger organizational structures is fundamental for biology	The mechanism of scale transitions in life
2111000	2284970	35:11	Up until the 70s, copying in biology really meant DNA replication and, to some extent, cell division. Some plants, for example, have six or eight or even more copies of their genome in each of their cells. This suggests that this copying operation is indeed scale free.

2286780	2847910	38:06	Diversification is generally thought of as random. But at the gene and genome level, you have active diversification by various processes. At the bottom, cells actively diversify by lots of different mechanisms. FEP tells us that efficiency is actually about intelligence.	Diversification is generally thought of as random. And here I have Barbara McClintock arguing against randomness	Evolution 4, Diversity and the FEP
2849470	3268390	47:29	The FEP actually gives us scale free biology. It predicts that living systems will have very limited classical data structures. The challenge is to evolve quantum information theory from theoretical to empirical testability. Andrew will be doing your questions on Saturday 20 October.	The FEP gives us scale free biology, or something very close to scale free	Quantum Biochemistry and Scale-Free Biology
3269400	3501980	54:29	Semantics versus machine learning. To what extent does natural language semantics depend on reference? When we start to connect words to images, or better yet, to actual objects, they start to be connected to external reference. That transition is going to be very interesting to watch.	Semantics versus machine learning is an interesting experiment in natural language semantics	Semantics vs Machine Learning
3502450	3793900	58:22	Chris Fields: How can cells get away with so little classical information? Fields: If we think of what we measure as not necessarily reflecting a static structure, we'll start to conceptualize it differently. Thinking of these as fluid, reversible processes is going to change the way we think about them.	Tucker asks Chris Fields questions about quantum mediated phenomena in biology	Quantum biology of cell biology
3795150	3976110	1:03:15	How can a quantum system detect and respond to quantum context shifts switches? It's sort of the inverse of the problem of predicting the side effects. I think this is something that we need to think about happening at many different scales. It's been an amazing lecture series.
