00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,810
Hello and welcome, everybody.

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,852
This is physics as information processing.

3
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:26,050
It's October 28, 2023, and we're in discussion 6, so we'll see where and how and when we go.

4
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,496
But to begin with, thank you for watching.

5
00:00:29,598 --> 00:00:36,276
If you're watching live, please feel free to write any questions or comments in the live chat.

6
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:46,300
As this is our last discussion, we're going to be probably ranging broadly, so looking forward to people's comments there.

7
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:56,930
Otherwise, perhaps we can all go around first and say hello or just give any thoughts or reflections to get things going.

8
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:07,988
And then we'll jump into some of the questions and answers and look at some of these great thoughts that have been sent and responded to.

9
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:11,616
So perhaps Dean and then Harrison, David, any just overall thoughts or comments to get us going?

10
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,424
Thanks.

11
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:20,980
Daniel.

12
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:36,216
I guess my overall impression was that I think that the way that the entire series was organized and structured allowed for these kinds of conversations that we're having today, which I think are really valuable.

13
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:56,640
As you can see on the slide here, I think a lot of question and answer tends to be focused around "what is," whereas the conversations that we've had, we can sort of tease that apart a little bit and ask questions around "what if?"

14
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,196
And get into the counterfactual piece of it and interact around that.

15
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:01,892
And I've really, really appreciated that, so that's my overall sense that we haven't left it sort of on the page.

16
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,800
We've actually been able to sort of breathe some life into it through these conversations.

17
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,018
Cool.

18
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:20,090
Haris?

19
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,030
Yeah, I just wanted to say that it was a great series.

20
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:45,620
We all learned a lot, and we got the opportunity to even ask questions to Chris and get back some very insightful answers that they are very helpful in order to, let's say, push the envelope forward.

21
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,226
Overall, this has been a great series.

22
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,006
I've enjoyed it a lot.

23
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:57,654
And while conversing with some of my colleagues, they also enjoyed it.

24
00:02:57,692 --> 00:03:00,826
So the feedback is great.

25
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:07,340
And thanks to active Inference Institute for facilitating this, and to you guys.

26
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,466
Thank you.

27
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:11,450
ThanK you and welcome.

28
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,190
David, if you want to just begin with, any thoughts or what brought you into the game in the bottom of the night?

29
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:41,640
Well, in school, I was actually trying to use free energy to develop some sort of a network of agents that were deciding what information to send and what states to be in based on each other's approximation of each other's states.

30
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,920
So I registered at the beginning, but then I guess life happened and I didn't really cross the page.

31
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,346
Now I'm just kind of opening up to things and participating more in the world that I exist in.

32
00:03:58,448 --> 00:03:59,930
And this is a natural.

33
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,980
This is really tied to the work that I was doing in school.

34
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,438
I don't know if this is a place to ask a question, so I'm not going to ask any questions.

35
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:11,680
Let's begin with that.

36
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:12,878
Okay.

37
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:14,480
Yeah, so I was thinking about.

38
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,410
I'm still confused about like Markov blankets and non- localism.

39
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,386
How would those two work together?

40
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:35,474
Well, like, nonlocalism, seems to me that an entity could be distributed arbitrarily in whatever is.

41
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:53,770
I don't know if the universe is like spacetime is what is, or if that's just a construction that we create through the information processing and putting relation, enunciating or rendering the information in a way where it's like all the related components can be mutually distinguished.

42
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,662
But the Markov blanket seems to be highly local.

43
00:04:57,796 --> 00:05:01,534
I don't know, maybe this is what, like, I'm confused about this.

44
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:07,140
It seems to be highly local, and it seems like everything is connected with everything.

45
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:20,434
So I'm kind of confused about how an entity could be defined with a Markov blanket while at the same time what seems to be completely intertwined, nonlocal, mutually defined.

46
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,480
Yes, Dean, please.

47
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,382
So can I just, David, just clarification.

48
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:40,970
Are you thinking that local and nonlocal is somehow similar to maybe arbitrary?

49
00:05:46,240 --> 00:06:01,964
I'm thinking local is within a volume and nonlocal is distributed like a sphere, like a small sphere, where all the information is within a sphere and everything within that sphere is causally relevant and everything without is causally irrelevant.

50
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:11,670
But then when I'm thinking of a Markov blanket as a sphere and everything on the inside is like independent statistically from everything on the outside.

51
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,928
I guess I'm asking around, where do you see that being placed?

52
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:20,180
Do you see that being placed arbitrarily?

53
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:39,940
When you set that up, whenever you decide where that boundary exists, are you asking because it's local or it's nonlocal because it's wherever inside and outside is present?

54
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,700
Is the...what's the word I'm looking for?

55
00:06:50,230 --> 00:07:01,320
Are you wondering about how that doesn't seem to be consistent, that in one minute it can be here and then the next minute it can change and arbitrarily end up being in a different place?

56
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,224
It doesn't seem to me that that's the confusion.

57
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:25,332
It's more like, you know, David Bohm's implicate and explicate order and the idea that the explicate order is like one hologram.

58
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:33,752
There's the holo movement where each layer affects each layer and the explicate is all at once explicate order, mutual relatedness.

59
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:51,520
I don't know if these words are incoherent completely. But then the Markov blanket, like, I'm taking the example of my skin.

60
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:59,036
I don't know if that's even a good example, but my skin is like a Markov blanket.

61
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:05,510
But then if everything is mutually related in explicate order, this whole body is submerged in the same field that everything else is submerged in.

62
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,372
And in that sense, everything is linked to everything.

63
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,908
Let me try adding a few pieces.

64
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,930
So welcome.

65
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,630
Ander and Chris will hopefully join, too.

66
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,230
Here we go.

67
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,390
Okay, opening act.

68
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:53,200
Just to catch up, Chris and Ander. David asked about the Markov blanket and about, if/how everything is connected to everything and how we associate Markov blanket or the holographic screen with localism and nonlocality.

69
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,332
Do you want to give any quick thoughts on this, or are you asking.

70
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:58,852
Me if you want to?

71
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,250
Either of you could.

72
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,720
I don't know.

73
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,570
Let's wait a minute for Chris to show up.

74
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,088
Yeah, I'm here now.

75
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:11,770
Yeah, I'm glad you found the way.

76
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:22,608
Did you guys go through the slides of last time, the lecture on biology.

77
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:23,696
No, no.

78
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:27,330
We just began and started with a Markov blanket question.

79
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:50,504
Yeah, I think you wouldn't hurt to talk about that, because a big part of that last lecture was the copy and diversify notion as a universal feature in nature, and naively, I think the creation of new boundaries is implicit in there.

80
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:57,050
So maybe Chris can comment, but I also thought it was very worthy of mentioning today, the cycle of error correction, memory and so on.

81
00:10:00,322 --> 00:10:05,490
So those would be my only two comments in the agenda for today.

82
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,680
Maybe Chris can say a few words, but I didn't mean to interrupt.

83
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,530
So, Markov Blanket, we can pivot it to biology, I'm sure.

84
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,120
Okay, I think I'm seeing this question.

85
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,480
Is this a question about the definition of Markov blankets?

86
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,590
There's something about...I can't actually see the entire.

87
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,390
No, it's not a question on my screen.

88
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,710
Oh, it's not a question on your screen.

89
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,170
Right.

90
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,984
But could you tell me what the question is again?

91
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:43,710
Yeah, David, just restate it how you see it.

92
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:59,804
Well, the question was if everything is mutually connected and mutually defined and interconnected, and there's nonlocalism in the sense that everything is mutually connected and mutually defined...and I'm kind of implicitly working with the assumption that the implicate-explicate order makes sense, and the explicate is, like one hologram.

93
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:12,710
And it's lost audio altogether now.

94
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,790
Oh, I still hear him.

95
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,132
Oh, the audio.

96
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,590
Chris.

97
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,162
Yeah, I lost at least half of that audio; just dropped out altogether.

98
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,270
Try to.

99
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,600
Sorry about that.

100
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:46,086
If everything is kind of explicated, like, if it's information in the brain is kind of rendering it all at once together, I'm just confused, and the whole body is submerged in it.

101
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:57,520
If I look in the mirror, the whole body is submerged in it, and it's all nonlocal.

102
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:08,290
By that, I mean it's all connected together and mutually defined and mutually necessary to even make sense of any piece of it--if there is even such a thing as a piece.

103
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,266
So that's one way of looking at it.

104
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:19,526
And then the other way is, what's local to me, it seems like there's, the skin Markov blanket, and it's kind of local.

105
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:25,778
And I'm kind of confused as to how those things work.

106
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,166
It seems like all the information in a sphere, a sphere could be a Markov blanket.

107
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:44,494
And then on the inside and the outside, they're statistically independent, is that the whole movement on the inside and the outside, because of the Markov blanket, separates those.

108
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:48,858
But then if this whole body is submerged in this thing that's mutually related.

109
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,426
I don't know.

110
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:57,780
I'm confused as to how those things work together.

111
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:09,800
I'm not sure I understand your question, but I suspect the answer has to do with whose point of view we're talking about.

112
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:16,490
So, if you are the system that's in...so let's fix a Markov blanket someplace.

113
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:35,806
If you're the system on the inside, then all you can see is what's encoded on the blanket, and you have no independent access to what the dynamic says on the outside.

114
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:39,600
So you don't actually know what the dynamics is on the outside.

115
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:53,430
And similarly, if you're on the outside. Now, if you're somehow able to view the whole system, you can see the whole system as having some joint dynamics.

116
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:02,870
But if the whole system is isolated, then there isn't anybody on the outside, kind of by definition.

117
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:12,220
So the idea of a whole dynamics is just a theoretical postulate that we make to make the mathematics make sense.

118
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:39,860
Now, if you move from the classical formulation to the quantum formulation, then it's possible to prove a very nice theorem, which is that if you're inside a holographic screen, you can't measure the entanglement entropy across the screen.

119
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:50,360
What that means is that you can't know that your state is conditionally independent of what's going on outside.

120
00:14:50,810 --> 00:15:00,140
So if you're inside a holographic screen, you can't know that you're not entangled with whatever's outside.

121
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,860
So you can't even know whether you have a well-defined state in a sense.

122
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:29,538
I think the same thing would probably hold true from the point of view inside a Markov blanket, that you wouldn't be able to know whether your Markov blanket had holes in it or something like that.

123
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:36,790
The problem is, in the classical formulation, you assume there's no analog of entanglement.

124
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,310
So there's no analog of entanglement entropy.

125
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:51,530
So I think the strongest thing you can say is you don't actually know your statistical relationship to what's going on outside, but you still can only see what's encoded on the blanket.

126
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,270
Thank you, Chris.

127
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,798
If I could add a few more pieces.

128
00:15:57,974 --> 00:16:01,070
So, David, you described everything connected to everything.

129
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:12,734
For a system with that kind of a base graph, there aren't Markov blankets, because a Markov blanket is the set of nodes that make two other sets of nodes conditionally independent.

130
00:16:12,862 --> 00:16:19,426
So in a fully connected setting, again leading to the question, what is outside of that?

131
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:23,560
But in a fully connected setting, you don't have a blanket as such.

132
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:34,470
In fact, the Bayesian graph describes the factorization, or the articulation and the sparsity of the system.

133
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:41,866
So it is a connectedness that is usually much, much sparser than everything connected to everything.

134
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:46,170
But that's not to say that differences can't make a difference at a distance.

135
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,690
It's just that they propagate through a local causal structure.

136
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,862
And then spacetime is constructed by certain kinds of cognitive agents; that was one of the key aspects of this course.

137
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:12,290
And so we can take as primary the topology of the active inference agent-environment relation.

138
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:24,550
And then Markov blanket is just the sensorium on the inbound and the action capacity on the outbound.

139
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:38,240
One question, though, I do have to that is, what about the nonzero gravitational effect, for example, of something that's distant in space and time?

140
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,482
Of course, Markov blankets don't have to be spatio-temporal.

141
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:45,950
They can be in arbitrary state spaces.

142
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:54,370
But how do we deal with those kinds of long range influences?

143
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,160
That's my question.

144
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,086
Yeah.

145
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:10,610
Well, here I think it's useful to contrast Newtonian gravity with Einsteinian gravity.

146
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:27,030
Newtonian gravity is infinite range and instantaneously acting, whereas Einsteinian gravity is infinite range, but it's locally encoded.

147
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:42,650
So the Einsteinian gravity that you feel is your local measurement of the curvature of your local bit of spacetime.

148
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,854
So that is very much happening on your Markov blanket, right?

149
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:51,594
It's a local measurement, local in spacetime.

150
00:18:51,642 --> 00:19:08,500
So let's assume there's a spacetime that's objective and characterizes everything, then you're locally measuring it on your blanket, and that's what you feel as gravitational attraction or your mass.

151
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:20,970
Whereas in Newtonian or Laplacian gravity, you don't have that sense of locality, right, as soon as something changes anywhere in the universe, it affects you.

152
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:40,640
So Einstein was struggling, of course, to make gravity consistent with electromagnetism, where it was clear that forces are transmitted at finite speed, the speed of light.

153
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:49,310
And he didn't have the idea of a graviton moving at the speed of light, but he did have this idea of local measurement.

154
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:59,010
So nonlocality was anathema to Einstein, and that's basically why he spent so much trouble removing it from physics.

155
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:08,760
And that's why he hated the idea of entanglement so much, because it seemed to him that from a spacetime point of view, it had to be nonlocal.

156
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,410
Daniel, can I bring up a point at this point?

157
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:23,178
So I think this is somewhat relevant to a question I really wanted to ask Chris, which is in lecture 6.

158
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,118
I remember minute 23.

159
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:46,306
I wish I had written it down, but I can roughly remember there was that phylogenetic graph, and you see life growing in a self-similar way, just like the genealogical tree of species, same thing happens at the individual level with growth and so on.

160
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:54,646
Anyways, I found that fascinating in the sense that the degrees of freedom, of life as a whole, grow, right, and around that minute 23, you made a comment, well, then the environment must be shrinking.

161
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:03,110
And you tie this with spacetime, and something about spacetime from the physics side, we also have cosmological inflation and what not.

162
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,434
Are any of those things related?

163
00:21:15,562 --> 00:21:21,680
That remark, I feel like, was made in passing, and I think there's a lot there to be said.

164
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:29,426
It also maybe shed some light on the emergent spacetime issue.

165
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:48,786
If it does emerge from a more basic ontological object, like the tensor network and the degrees of freedom in the tensor network, is it fair to say that life, as it grows, gets more of those degrees of freedom, but then somehow anything that happens to spacetime is an illusion in that sense? I don't even know if I'm formulating that question right.

166
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:55,260
But I think Chris knows what I'm talking about.

167
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:08,970
Yeah, the comment makes the most sense in the context of the state space itself, leaving aside spacetime.

168
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:24,340
So if you think of a Hilbert space and draw a boundary someplace that separates what we're going to call life from what we're going to call nonlife.

169
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:39,880
And essentially, what life has done over the past 3 billion years is incorporate bits of the nonlife part of the state space into life.

170
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,940
Right.

171
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:52,300
Total biomass is increasing, so more and more of the available mass is getting incorporated into living things.

172
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:59,040
And so if we can kind of heuristically fold spacetime in and say, "you know, in the locality, in the locale of Earth, and over this fairly short time period, the expansion of spacetime is more or less negligible."

173
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:32,010
So life is actually taking up more space now than it did certainly at the time of LUCA, when all of us weren't around.

174
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,500
But there is just one probably population of cells that we're descendants of.

175
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:59,380
But the point about the Hilbert space is just the point that if you've divided it in two and you move the boundary, then one system gets bigger at the expense of the other system, which now has less of the Hilbert space.

176
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:07,140
So that's all that remark really is.

177
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:16,360
As the system, in a sense, takes over degrees of freedom of the environment.

178
00:24:18,802 --> 00:24:28,502
In that case, it becomes a different system at every time step from the point of view that it has now a different Hilbert space and different internal dynamics.

179
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,540
So physically it's a different thing.

180
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,782
But when we look at it, we say, "oh, this thing is continuous through time." It's expanding, it's growing, it's developing, evolving, whatever.

181
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,080
Right.

182
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:59,358
So then, I guess, comment, just a question that just occurred as you were talking, that begs the question, does that biomass come to dominate all the degrees of freedom in the universe?

183
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:17,290
Is that presumably there's a tension with the rate at which those degrees of freedom are growing and the rate at which spacetime is growing, does the growth of spacetime, in terms of those degrees of freedom that may be more fundamental, amount to loss in error correction capacity?

184
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:27,310
And maybe more speculatively, how you reconcile this with loss of thermodynamics.

185
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:35,970
Are you implying that life is going to come to dominate everything and fill up the entirety of the known universe?

186
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,730
Yeah, I think that's a stretch.

187
00:25:43,590 --> 00:26:00,390
But I would say at this point that until we have a mature theory of quantum gravity that makes enough empirical predictions to be testable, it's not clear, at least to me, how the whole emergent spacetime picture fits together with the inflationary picture or the expanding spacetime picture. In some sense, taking a strict Hilbert space view, if the universe is an isolated system, then its Hilbert space is fixed.

188
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:48,040
And so your question, in a sense, becomes, what's the relationship between spacetime and the Hilbert space?

189
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:54,780
Are what we think of as spacetime degrees of freedom, real degrees of freedom, or not?

190
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:04,960
And seems to me that question really isn't resolved, and I'm not sure at this point how to resolve it.

191
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:20,160
Just have something small to add.

192
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:28,610
Overall, this is very interesting, and these questions are very deep.

193
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:43,430
What I wanted to add is what I was thinking about the initial question regarding Markov blanket, and I also have some question that it's related with it.

194
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,200
But I will ask Chris later.

195
00:27:46,830 --> 00:28:00,000
What I wanted to add now is that basically, Markov Blanket are a way of describing the boundaries of a system in terms of statistical mechanics or statistics, let's say, and essentially, from what I understand, they are paramount in order to define observers and also the systems under observation.

196
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:30,310
So any physical system that can be seen as an observer with a Markov blanket, let's say, so now, trying to tie it all up with active inference.

197
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:51,098
Well, active inference, as I understand it, it implies that the system is actively referring to its external states from its internal states in an effort to both learn, let's say, and adapt to the environment.

198
00:28:51,274 --> 00:28:58,714
So this goes back and ties with this metaphorical link, let's say, with the skin.

199
00:28:58,842 --> 00:29:01,890
This is how I understand it.

200
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:17,400
And it actually means that a system with a Markov blanket can actually be seen as performing physics as information processing, which is the book of this series that Chris is offering to us.

201
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,554
And a final comment in terms of nonlocality.

202
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,522
Nonlocality can actually be seen as a form of information processing.

203
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:28,460
So this is what I wanted to add.

204
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,500
Did you say how nonlocality is a form of information processing?

205
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,230
Yes, this is how I understand it.

206
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,950
What do you think about that, Chris?

207
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:33,050
If we put it in terms of entanglement, entanglement is a useful resource for information processing, but it's only a usable resource if it's combined with classical communication, either across time or across space.

208
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:51,612
So entanglement is only useful as a resource if different observers can act locally, i.e., without interfering with each other on the quantum resource.

209
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:18,820
So if you think of entanglement as nonlocality, if you embed it in spacetime in that way, then it is useful as a computational resource.

210
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:35,848
But the observers also have to transmit classical communications in a way that fully complies with locality.

211
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:39,192
So in a Bell/EPR type experiment, for example, if you have Alice in one lab and Bob in the other lab making measurements of some entangled state, then at some point to know that the state is entangled, they have to send their classical records to each other as classical communication and then deal with those records locally.

212
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:17,800
So in a sense, nonlocality in that sense is useful for computation, but it's only useful if you also have locality.

213
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,464
Great.

214
00:32:21,662 --> 00:32:22,570
Thank you.

215
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,784
Actually, I'm working on a novel notion.

216
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:41,250
That is something like, takes the notion of entanglement and transform it in the following sense.

217
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:49,920
I'm actually thinking of maximum unentanglement as a resource for classical computation.

218
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,800
So that's something I am actually exploring.

219
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,900
I find it to be a nice concept.

220
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,860
Did you say maximum unentanglement?

221
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,776
Yes.

222
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,404
Maximum separability?

223
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:06,872
Yeah.

224
00:33:06,926 --> 00:33:08,632
Okay, that makes sense.

225
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,000
I mean, we need maximum separability.

226
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,140
We need to be able to factor a state space to talk about two different observers.

227
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,820
So to talk about conditional independence.

228
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,950
Yeah.

229
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:37,410
In my head, this maximum unentanglement as a resource can actually be expended to perform classical computation or even to increase the coherence of a quantum system.

230
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,250
So I'm playing with that notion a bit.

231
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,990
Thank you.

232
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,150
Can I ask one thing really quick about.

233
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,750
Yeah, okay.

234
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:05,840
So apparently, from what I don't understand very much, but from Bohr, apparently, the whole experimental setup was one entity that couldn't be broken down into constituent pieces that are interacting, but had to be taken as one entity--from what I understand--and apparently Einstein's view was, well, I really don't know what his view was, but apparently it's not one entity; it can be broken down into localized pieces that are interacting.

235
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,812
And apparently they couldn't get along, Bohr, Einstein.

236
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,460
Apparently there was like a party or something, and then they all congregated to separate parts of the room and didn't really interact.

237
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:53,884
And apparently it was because they had these opposing views on the same thing--breaking down the interconnectedness into separate constituent subsystems.

238
00:34:53,932 --> 00:35:02,096
And even taking the partial trace--there was one universal function taking the partial trace--which [John] Preskill defined...the subsystems, whenever perfectly, it's all tied together, but I can't really explain what I'm trying to say.

239
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,104
These seem like two very opposed view.

240
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:20,212
They seem like very alternative views.

241
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:27,448
Like on one side you have kind of an indivisible whole.

242
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:43,440
On the other side you have locality where it's almost like there's like a sequence of measurements leading up to an ego, an "I" that then measures as like a real entity. Another one is like the observer and the observed are one thing, they cannot be meaningfully separated.

243
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:53,220
Maybe functionally they can be separated, but as actually existing subcomponents, they cannot be defined strictly.

244
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,508
From what I understand, one of them is saying, yes, you can define these subsystems and they really do exist as separate entities.

245
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:18,590
The other one is saying, that's just a useful way to organize information, to operate on that information, deposit a subject and an object, and to have the subject operate on the object is a useful way for thinking to separate itself.

246
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,472
And it seems like this is closer to Bohr than the other one is closer...well, apparently that's a distinction of Bohr and Einstein, from what I understand, which is, please correct me if it's wrong.

247
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,112
Yeah, I just wanted to put that out there.

248
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:38,950
And I don't know what that's going to spawn in terms of responses, but yes.

249
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:50,630
Well, I think that's a fair characterization of the Bohr-Einstein debate, actually.

250
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,492
To add a response there, whether it actually exists, it seems like in one of those framings, you had an observer looking at something, and if we define actually existing in a relational observed setting, then to the observer the measurement actually exists.

251
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,440
Prepare, measure, prepare, measure.

252
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:21,040
And then from another perspective, viewing that setup, then it's the observer of a setup.

253
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:48,600
And so it's just, again, to Chris's first point about what perspective, and this is one of the most essential pieces that the blanket screen relationality brings into play, is there isn't a view from nowhere, but there is a perspective that may have a definite answer, and yet there are multiple perspectives that have complementary answers in our scenario.

254
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,432
Daniel, can I speak for a minute?

255
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:52,200
Oh, yeah.

256
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,188
I was muted earlier.

257
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:53,844
I didn't realize.

258
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:54,648
I meant to ask, David, I don't have an answer to your question, but I was wondering if you could reformulate.

259
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,876
Would it be fair to reformulate your question as saying, are blankets objective or not?

260
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:10,016
Is the Bohr-Einstein debate equivalent to that?

261
00:38:10,118 --> 00:38:25,040
And then second, and I guess this may be for Chris, I was skimming through the answers, and one of them was talking about how one of the big tensions between general relativity and quantum theory is the idea of object persistence, and I don't know how to articulate it either, but I feel like it was more or less what you were getting at, David, is that correct?

262
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,464
Yeah, I think that's another way to put it.

263
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:51,630
And also the thing you said about the third person looking at those systems, if there's multi-agent communication, that's kind of the thing that I'm kind of stuck on in terms of trying to understand this, because if there's a third agent looking okay, those two are subsumed in the information on the holographic screen.

264
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,576
I don't know.

265
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:04,370
Anyways, so that's where I'm kind of...

266
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:16,500
I think a delightful thing to read here is Eugene Wigner's paper where he introduces the Wigner's Friend thought experiment [1961, Remarks on the Mind-Body Question, Wigner E].

267
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,070
And I think it's from.

268
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,796
There's a book called the Scientist Speculates [1962, The Scientist Speculates: An Anthology of Partly-Baked Ideas, Good, IJ].

269
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:30,170
The editor is someone named Good.

270
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,356
And Wigner has a paper in this book.

271
00:39:37,538 --> 00:39:39,790
I think it's 1961.

272
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:53,200
And it's also the paper where Wigner talks about consciousness being an essential concept in quantum theory.

273
00:39:53,540 --> 00:40:03,300
But the thought experiment is that Wigner's Friend is doing an experiment in his laboratory and making observations, and Wigner is outside the laboratory.

274
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:18,212
And Wigner has to regard his friend as in some sort of superposition with his instrument.

275
00:40:18,276 --> 00:40:22,280
He has to regard his friend as entangled with his friend's instruments until Wigner can actually interact locally with the friend, and make a measurement of the friend's state.

276
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:45,070
And so it makes Wigner's friend and his apparatus look like an entangled pair.

277
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:52,370
And Wigner now looks like an experimenter who's operating on just one part of an entangled pair.

278
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:59,010
But Wigner himself tells the story very nicely.

279
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:15,560
And that sort of historical text, I think, is always useful to have a look at and see how the people themselves were responding to this idea.

280
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,250
And Wigner is quite perplexed by this thought experiment.

281
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:38,862
And I think all of those people, they were quite honestly mystified with what observation actually is and what consciousness is.

282
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:48,130
And all of these other questions that people are a little bit scared to talk about in the ensuing several decades.

283
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,040
Self-reference.

284
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,030
Yeah, you can go ahead.

285
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:06,260
Self-reference seems to be like there's this ancient symbol of the Uroboros--the output is the input--it feeds on itself.

286
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,200
Even like consciousness.

287
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,960
I have to contextualize...it's self referential.

288
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,376
Everything refers to itself.

289
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:25,176
And then at the end, self-reference is where all the paradoxes are like, this sentence is false.

290
00:42:25,288 --> 00:42:27,036
Or all I know is that I know nothing.

291
00:42:27,138 --> 00:42:29,260
These are all paradoxical statements.

292
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,000
So there's some sort of mystery, "cell division of self reference."

293
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:39,170
That ancient view is that it's like embryogenesis, cosmogenesis, same thing.

294
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,970
I don't know.

295
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,424
It seems to me that there's some sort of mystery that's so.

296
00:42:47,462 --> 00:42:48,144
It's like the mind.

297
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:50,036
It just eludes I don't know.

298
00:42:50,138 --> 00:42:53,510
Thinking tries to make these thought systems, but it just slips out.

299
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,876
I can't grasp it.

300
00:42:55,898 --> 00:43:05,112
I don't mean...but that's already a conclusion, which I don't necessarily want to even make, because if it's self-referenced, that is thinking, OK, then maybe it goes all the way to the bottom.

301
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,836
Daniel, can I ask you a question before we run out of time?

302
00:43:11,938 --> 00:43:12,924
Actually, I have two.

303
00:43:12,962 --> 00:43:14,188
Maybe one is a bit longer, the second one.

304
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:31,344
So the first one, Chris. I was very intrigued and looking forward to hear you talk a little bit about that cycle of error correction and memory and persistence and so on.

305
00:43:31,462 --> 00:43:43,876
And in particular, I was wondering if it relates at all to the main other thing you talked about in that lecture 6, the copy and diversify business, because intuitively, if that cycle is something that an organism has to implement--I'm talking about that slide with the error correction and what not--then it pays the thermodynamic price for it.

306
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:09,624
So presumably there is an anabolic process of trying to grow so you can feed degrees of freedom into this error correcting scheme, thinking like a physicist.

307
00:44:09,672 --> 00:44:11,710
Something like that might be happening.

308
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:19,116
So is the copy and diversify feature a necessity of having to run this cycle?

309
00:44:19,308 --> 00:44:21,970
That's my first question.

310
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,582
That's a good question.

311
00:44:38,636 --> 00:44:40,390
I don't know whether it's necessary.

312
00:44:47,720 --> 00:45:06,380
I think one could think of a fairly small scale heat engine or metabolic system that can pull just enough free energy out of its environment to store a one-bit memory.

313
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,964
And you can think of something like a flip flop, right?

314
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,352
These things aren't alive.

315
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:32,500
So it's not quite as complex as an organism, but it is using energy to maintain a memory, and its memory does influence its behavior.

316
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:40,870
So I think we have these limiting cases like this that don't have to grow.

317
00:45:43,820 --> 00:46:04,990
But when you think about organisms, organisms have the problem of being made out of very delicate parts that need to be replaced.

318
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:18,530
And it's that degradation that I think is driving this need for constant copying.

319
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:51,100
And from a physics point of view, I think what that boils down to is that the organisms living right at the edge of an interaction with its environment that's too strong to maintain.

320
00:46:52,080 --> 00:47:15,910
So the environmental interaction is constantly at risk of spinning out of control and having too large an energy transfer, which basically tears the Markov blanket apart and exposes too many of the internal degrees of freedom to the outside.

321
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:33,710
So this may be one way of saying what characterizes life, that it's interacting with its environment right on the edge of an interaction that's too strong.

322
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:49,380
And it's great to have a strong interaction because then you have big eigenvalues and so you have large bandwidth, but the risk is that the environment tears you apart.

323
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:59,630
Close to the fire, but don't get burnt.

324
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:15,634
Become the fire and then control the redox balance and gain that autopoietic regulative capacity, which works when it works.

325
00:48:15,832 --> 00:48:16,398
Yeah.

326
00:48:16,504 --> 00:48:19,190
Until something comes along with bigger teeth.

327
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:40,102
Another comment, if I may, is, as the course comes to an end, two things I realized associated to classicality that we've talked a lot about in this class are object persistence and boundaries.

328
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:40,538
Right?

329
00:48:40,624 --> 00:48:49,470
So classicality being a feature, intrinsically boundary related, and having a lot to do with object persistence.

330
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:59,410
So are just these things completely dual from an FEP point of view, because you want to maintain the integrity of the boundary, you want to preserve that classical information, presumably.

331
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,234
I'm not sure.

332
00:49:05,272 --> 00:49:25,286
I guess my question to everyone is, are object persistence in the topic of classicality...object persistence and boundaries...are these basically completely dual pictures?

333
00:49:25,398 --> 00:49:26,620
That's my question.

334
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,810
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

335
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:36,480
And we also need object persistence to define space.

336
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:52,980
So this idea of object persistence is a very key idea that has to be dealt with.

337
00:49:53,830 --> 00:50:01,190
And physics has largely ignored this idea, which is kind of objects are taken for granted.

338
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:15,976
But I think what Karl [Friston] says in that 2019 "Free Energy Principle for a Particular Physics" paper is fairly clear on this.

339
00:50:16,078 --> 00:50:23,320
He basically says the free energy principle tells systems to persist.

340
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:32,140
That's basically what a system has to do by maintaining the integrity of its Markov blanket.

341
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,020
I think that's very insightful.

342
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,960
If it doesn't, it's not.

343
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:44,070
Yeah, it's not a system anymore.

344
00:50:47,210 --> 00:51:02,650
Well, as we somewhat glide towards a local closure, of course anyone is welcome to bring up any reflections.

345
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:15,070
And also, I'd love to hear about where we go from this now measured outcome.

346
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:26,820
How do we prepare individually, at the Institute scale, ecosystem scale, and what are we going to do coming out of this?

347
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,080
Are we talking about that right now.

348
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,780
Or any thoughts?

349
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,710
Yeah, keep learning, bro.

350
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,160
What do you mean by the ecosystem scale?

351
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:54,240
Like the active inference ecosystem and our own ecosystems going on our own scale.

352
00:51:54,740 --> 00:52:06,310
I guess the only thing I can comment on this is I echo the view that, or not view, or rather remark that Chris made in the lecture about quantum biology as a field.

353
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,190
It's in a nascent stage, right?

354
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:18,520
Mean, I think, you know, there will be a nontrivial interaction between the active inference community and quantum biology.

355
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,110
I'm making that surmise right now.

356
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:39,832
So let's talk about quantum biology for a second. I'll open up the Pandora's box here.

357
00:52:39,886 --> 00:52:43,524
Let's think of it as a parable as opposed, or maybe even fan fiction, because Chris has shared so much with us, I want to kind of build off of it.

358
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,500
If you will indulge me for a second, I'll read you a little story.

359
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,150
Just hear the story out.

360
00:52:54,320 --> 00:53:07,830
"Quantum biology sounds like more than up or down without saying that it is more. Up or down, as what information can be counterfactually, is looking at carrying capacity as "can be."

361
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,360
And from that carrying capacity comes orientation, things like direction and scale. Things like the ability to plan appear to fit better in the orientation category relative to the carrying capacity category, which is noncommunativity in action."

362
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:38,430
This is a big "if"--"If we agree that orientation is to follow, should our recognizing of planning affordances follow as well."

363
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,384
"So from the session slide, there was a quote--'Living systems are genetic quantum systems that the FEP has driven to a high level of computational complexity.'

364
00:53:49,532 --> 00:53:57,776
And here the 'computation' is baked in as something planable. With this as a reference frame, to make plans, we need carrying capacity."

365
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,590
"Check. Agreed. But in order to learn where does the carrying capacity plus orientation relationship insist that we start with a received plan?

366
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:22,620
This perspective is compared to, say, actively inferring our way to the plan, falls out of carrying capacity.

367
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:46,120
Just making this explicit, we can then ask should we first apply a received plan or apply active inference. That helps clarify when the strategy is one more based on exploitation versus a strategy more based and biased to exploration."

368
00:54:46,200 --> 00:55:15,160
"In summary, when did information delivery things like product or package packaging begin to trump information carrying capacity, which is essentially information processing rather than we need this paired relationship, the carrying capacity plus the orientation, as a minimum of two, so that we can compare, identify change and know change model patterns, etcetera.'

369
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:23,400
"This is another way of asking when did subject matter expertise come to be seen as more valuable than prediction matter expertise, when it seems like we need both capacities if we want independency."

370
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,780
"And here's the kicker."

371
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:38,776
"If not given time to reflect on what's being asked here, and I know Chris oftentimes has a nice long pause to reflect...but if not given the time to reflect, people will take their subject matter expertise strategy, which clearly is a next move perspective, over one that holds up 'next move plus all moves,' meaning that they bring prediction matter expertise in to follow, to parameterize, to unlock, to unring, to unbound what's in and what's out."

372
00:56:04,622 --> 00:56:09,560
"Of course, without prediction matter expertise, what is quantum biology?"

373
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:14,540
Wow.

374
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:17,612
Can you just post that someplace so we can think about.

375
00:56:17,746 --> 00:56:19,740
I'll just email it to you, Chris.

376
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,610
Cool.

377
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,530
That was great.

378
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:31,080
Yeah.

379
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:41,306
I think you're asking about the fundamental question of what does Karl call it?

380
00:56:41,488 --> 00:56:48,720
Epistemic value and the role of curiosity and that whole cluster of issues.

381
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:55,374
Well, I think I need to give you the credit that you deserve on this.

382
00:56:55,412 --> 00:57:06,194
I think it's the fact that you have allowed us to interact with you that's given us that kind of courage and confidence to be able to put things out there.

383
00:57:06,232 --> 00:57:08,834
I don't know how much of it sticks or how much of it.

384
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:13,646
I'm not sure that it requires disciples, but I do think it provides.

385
00:57:13,758 --> 00:57:16,870
What you've done is provided that medium.

386
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:20,678
So again, I guess that's my way of saying thank you.

387
00:57:20,844 --> 00:57:21,798
Well, thank you.

388
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:27,894
Yeah.

389
00:57:27,932 --> 00:57:28,950
Thank you, Chris.

390
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:34,680
I have learned so much this year, more than ever before.

391
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:41,418
Okay, well, great.

392
00:57:41,604 --> 00:57:54,620
This has been a great class, and hopefully various things will come out of it.

393
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:58,508
Certainly just from looking at the questions that have been in the question forum.

394
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:12,070
Lots of people are thinking about these issues, and that's what I think AII needs going forward, is people thinking and talking about stuff.

395
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:16,230
Thank you, Chris. Yeah.

396
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:28,000
A few outcomes that we know; we'll transcribe the lectures, the discussions, add in screenshots, add in the Q and A, and publish those proceedings as a book.

397
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:42,450
We will pick back up in 2024 with potentially having the recorded and written contents as part of a curriculum.

398
00:58:43,350 --> 00:59:01,370
So not just replicating, but now continuing on with another quantum flow across this now classical artifact, because it's quantum in the moment, and then once it's communicated, it becomes a classic.

399
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:04,140
And we have months to prepare that state.

400
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:07,660
All right, great.

401
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:12,220
I'm going to have to sign off, but thank you very much.

402
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:13,790
Thank you, Chris.

403
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:15,150
Thank you.

404
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,510
Thank you, Chris.

405
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:18,510
Ciao.

406
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:19,630
Bye.

407
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:28,930
Does anyone else, does anyone else want to make any reflection or comment?

408
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:41,954
I just thank everybody that's helped organize, participated in all of the discussions, even the people who showed up at the very end of the discussions, because I really appreciate that.

409
00:59:42,072 --> 00:59:58,438
Again, I cannot emphasize enough, when we get a chance to interact with this stuff, when we get to manipulate it, when we're able to ask questions, even though we feel vulnerable, I think that that's when a lot of the really good stuff tends to get consolidated.

410
00:59:58,534 --> 01:00:00,380
So thank you to all of you.

411
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:12,990
I'll read some fun comments from the live chat, just the last several, just to recognize some of our great colleagues.

412
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:19,538
Lucrative leadership wrote, yes.

I don't speak this language, but I can definitely hear, understand, and feel it.

421
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,202
So thank you, everybody who's watching along.

422
01:00:44,256 --> 01:00:52,642
These were all great, and we prepare and measure every day at the institute.

423
01:00:52,726 --> 01:01:18,900
So I really do hope that people from all backgrounds, all vectors, all preference and prior sets come engage and not presuppose too much about us or themselves or what can happen when we really do interact and when we take it into the kinds of spaces and timelines that we know we want to be on.

424
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:24,242
All right, thank you.

425
01:01:24,376 --> 01:01:25,170

426
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,754
Thank you, everyone.
