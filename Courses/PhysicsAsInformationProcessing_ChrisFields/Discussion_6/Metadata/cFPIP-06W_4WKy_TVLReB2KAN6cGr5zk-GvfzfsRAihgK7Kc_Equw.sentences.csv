2940	3490	1	A	0.64	You.
7700	9810	2	B	0.96841	Hello and welcome, everybody.
10340	13852	3	B	0.99999	This is physics as information processing.
13996	26050	4	B	0.8394	It's October 28, 2023, and we're in discussion six, so we'll see where and how and when we go.
26420	29496	5	B	0.99979	But to begin with, thank you for watching.
29598	36276	6	B	0.99997	If you're watching live, please feel free to write any questions or comments in the live chat.
36388	46300	7	B	0.99998	As this is our last discussion, we're going to be probably ranging broadly, so looking forward to people's comments there.
46450	56930	8	B	0.97391	Otherwise, perhaps we can all go around first and say hello or just give any thoughts or reflections to get things going.
57300	67988	9	B	1.0	And then we'll jump into some of the questions and answers and look at some of these great thoughts that have been sent and responded to.
68074	71616	10	B	0.95093	So perhaps Dean and then Harrison.
71648	78490	11	B	0.99406	David, any just overall thoughts or comments to get us going?
80060	80424	12	C	0.99981	Thanks.
80462	80980	13	C	0.99574	Daniel.
81060	96216	14	C	1.0	I guess my overall impression was that I think that the way that the entire series was organized and structured allowed for these kinds of conversations that we're having today, which I think are really valuable.
96328	116640	15	C	0.99999	As you can see on the slide here, I think a lot of question and answer tends to be focused around what is, whereas the conversations that we've had, we can sort of tease that apart a little bit and ask questions around what if?
116790	120196	16	C	1.0	And get into the counterfactual piece of it and interact around that.
120218	121892	17	C	0.99	And I've really, really appreciated that.
121946	127670	18	C	0.98811	So that's my overall sense that we haven't left it sort of on the page.
129100	133800	19	C	0.87781	We've actually been able to sort of breathe some life into it through these conversations.
138270	139018	20	B	0.83268	Cool.
139184	140090	21	B	0.35721	Haris?
141550	146030	22	D	0.97878	Yeah, I just wanted to say that it was a great series.
146370	165620	23	D	0.9996	We all learned a lot, and we got the opportunity to even ask questions to Chris and get back some very insightful answers that they are very helpful in order to, let's say, push the envelope forward.
166550	170226	24	D	0.95476	Overall, this has been a great series.
170338	172006	25	D	0.9971	I've enjoyed it a lot.
172188	177654	26	D	0.99	And while conversing with some of my colleagues, they also enjoyed it.
177692	180826	27	D	0.94397	So the feedback is great.
181008	187340	28	D	0.99	And thanks to active Inference Institute for facilitating this, and to you guys.
188670	189466	29	A	0.99872	Thank you.
189568	191450	30	B	0.99952	ThanK you and welcome.
191600	198190	31	B	0.99994	David, if you want to just begin with, any thoughts or what brought you into the game in the bottom of the 9th?
202050	221640	32	A	0.99972	Well, in school, I was actually trying to use free energy to develop some sort of a network of agents that were deciding what information to send and what states to be in based on each other's approximation of each other's states.
223050	228920	33	A	0.73823	So I registered at the beginning, but then I guess life happened and I didn't really cross the page.
233630	238346	34	A	1.0	Now I'm just kind of opening up to things and participating more in the world that I exist in.
238448	239930	35	A	1.0	And this is a natural.
240990	243980	36	A	0.97786	This is really tied to the work that I was doing in school.
245150	247438	37	A	0.67	I don't know if this is a place to ask a question, so I'm.
247444	248254	38	D	0.99998	Not going to ask any questions.
248292	250202	39	A	0.70747	But that's like the urgent.
250346	251680	40	B	0.99994	Let's begin with that.
252370	252878	41	A	0.95723	Okay.
252964	254480	42	A	0.60793	Yeah, so I was thinking about.
255250	259410	43	A	0.9996	I'm still confused about like Markov Blanket and non localism.
263430	264386	44	A	0.70927	How would those two.
264408	265698	45	A	0.54505	What about work together?
265864	275474	46	A	0.99387	Well, like, non localism, seems to me that an entity could be distributed arbitrarily in whatever is.
275512	293770	47	A	1.0	I don't know if the universe is like Spacetime is what is, or if that's just a construction that we create through the information processing and putting relation, enunciating or rendering the information in a way where it's like all the related components can be mutually distinguished.
295230	297662	48	A	0.99896	But the Markov blanket seems to be highly local.
297796	301534	49	A	0.5	I don't know, maybe this is what, like, I'm confused about this.
301572	307140	50	A	0.95	It seems to be highly local, and it seems like everything is connected with everything.
308310	320434	51	A	0.99097	So I'm kind of confused about how an entity could be defined with a Markov blanket while at the same time what seems to be completely intertwined.
320482	324710	52	A	0.86623	Non local, mutually defined.
326090	327480	53	B	0.99805	Yes, Dean, please.
328090	329382	54	C	0.98425	So can I just.
329436	330818	55	C	0.96081	David, just clarification.
330994	340970	56	C	0.99912	Are you thinking that local and non local is somehow similar to maybe arbitrary?
346240	361964	57	A	0.98124	I'm thinking local is within a volume and non local is distributed like a sphere, like a small sphere, where all the information is within a sphere and everything within that sphere is causally relevant and Everything without is causally irrelevant.
362092	371670	58	A	0.94955	But then I'm thinking of a Markov blanket as a sphere and everything on the inside is like independent statistically from everything on the outside.
372200	376928	59	C	1.0	I guess I'm asking around, where do you see that being placed?
377024	380180	60	C	0.99997	Do you see that being placed arbitrarily?
384610	399940	61	C	0.9064	When you set that up, whenever you decide where that boundary exists, are you asking because it's local or it's non local because it's wherever inside and outside is present?
404710	405700	62	C	0.99107	Is the.
406550	408500	63	C	0.80646	What's the word I'm looking for?
410230	421320	64	C	0.99998	Are you wondering about how that doesn't seem to be consistent, that 1 minute it can be here and then the next minute it can change and arbitrarily end up being in a different place?
431160	434224	65	A	0.76	It doesn't seem to me that that's the confusion.
434272	445332	66	A	0.99357	It's more like, you know, David Bohm's implicate and explicated order and the idea that the explicated order is like one hologram.
445476	453752	67	A	0.56633	There's like the hollow movement where each layer affects each layer and the explicated is all at once explicate order, mutual relatedness.
453816	454670	68	A	1.0	I don't know.
457440	471520	69	A	1.0	I don't know if these words are incoherent completely, like, and then, but then the Markov blanket, like, I'm I'm taking the example of my skin.
472980	479036	70	A	0.94	I don't know if that's even good example, but my skin is like a Markov blanket.
479148	485510	71	A	0.9998	But then if everything is mutually related and explicated order, this whole body is submerged in the same field that everything else is submerged in.
486120	488372	72	A	1.0	And in that sense, everything is linked to everything.
488426	489060	73	A	0.97892	There's no.
489130	489844	74	A	1.0	I don't know.
489962	490630	75	A	0.65224	Like.
495500	497908	76	B	0.76224	Let me try adding a few pieces.
498084	499930	77	B	0.57294	So welcome.
500700	503630	78	B	0.66931	Ander and Chris will hopefully join, too.
504160	505230	79	B	0.99651	Here we go.
506800	509390	80	B	0.67202	Okay, opening act.
511440	533200	81	B	0.52154	Just to catch up, Chris and Ander. David asked about the Markov blanket and about if how everything is connected to everything and how we associate Markov Blanket or the holographic screen with localism and non locality.
533360	537332	82	B	0.99217	Do you want to give any quick thoughts on this, or are you asking.
537386	538852	83	E	0.99863	Me if you want to?
538906	540250	84	B	0.99949	Either of you could.
540700	541720	85	E	1.0	I don't know.
541870	544570	86	E	0.98519	Let's wait a minute for Chris to show up.
545980	548088	87	F	0.56362	Yeah, I'm here now.
548254	551770	88	E	0.5901	Yeah, I'm glad you found the way.
558420	558832	89	E	0.8068	Question.
558886	562608	90	E	0.98871	Did you guys go through the slides of last time, the lecture on.
562774	563696	91	E	0.65551	No, no.
563798	567330	92	B	0.99965	We just began and started with a Markov blanket question.
568100	590504	93	E	0.93944	Yeah, I think you wouldn't hurt to talk about that, because a big part of that last lecture was the copy and diversify notion as a universal feature in mean, naively, I think know the creation of new boundaries is implicit in there.
590542	597050	94	E	0.97738	So maybe Chris can comment, but I also thought it was very worthy of mentioning today.
597500	600284	95	E	0.50553	Know, the cycle of error correction, memory and so on.
600322	605490	96	E	0.93061	So those would be my only two comments in the agenda for today.
606340	609680	97	E	0.99992	Maybe Chris can say a few words, but I didn't mean to interrupt.
610180	614530	98	E	0.98043	So, Markov Blanket, we can pivot it to, I'm sure.
614900	617120	99	F	0.4443	Okay, I think I'm seeing this question.
617190	620480	100	F	0.99979	Is this a question about the definition of Markov Blanket?
621960	627590	101	F	0.98215	There's something about I can't actually see the entire.
628440	630390	102	B	0.9993	No, it's not a question on my screen.
630760	632710	103	F	1.0	Oh, it's not a question on your.
634060	635530	104	B	0.99364	Question on your screen.
637420	638170	105	F	0.99097	Right.
638860	640984	106	F	0.98979	But could you tell me what the question is again?
641022	643710	107	B	0.97042	Yeah, David, just restate it how you see it.
645120	659804	108	A	0.80909	Well, the question was if everything is mutually connected and mutually defined and interconnected, and there's non localism in the sense that everything is mutually connected and mutually defined.
659932	668112	109	A	1.0	And I'm kind of implicitly working with the assumption that the implicit explicit order makes sense.
668166	669884	110	A	1.0	And the explicit is, like one hologram.
669932	672710	111	F	0.99	And it's lost audio altogether now.
675320	676790	112	B	0.83	Oh, I still hear him.
678280	679132	113	A	0.79	Oh, the audio.
679216	679880	114	C	0.63755	Chris?
684730	685590	115	E	0.99402	Chris.
687530	690162	116	F	0.99345	Yeah, I lost at least half of that audio.
690226	691400	117	F	0.99996	Just dropped out.
694330	695270	118	A	0.77493	Try to.
695420	696600	119	A	0.99007	Sorry about that.
698010	706086	120	A	0.99823	If everything is kind of explicated, like, if it's information in the brain is kind of rendering it all at once together, I'm just confused.
706198	711486	121	A	1.0	And the whole body is submerged the whole body is submerged in it.
711668	717520	122	A	0.96022	If I look in the mirror, the whole body is submerged in it, and it's all non local.
718130	728290	123	A	0.99998	By that, I mean it's all connected together and mutually defined and mutually necessary to even make sense of any piece of it, if there is even such a thing as a piece.
728360	729490	124	A	1.0	And I'm wondering.
730870	733266	125	A	0.9756	So thaT's one way of looking at it.
733288	739526	126	A	1.0	And then the other way is, like, the local to me, it seems like there's, like, the skin Markov blanket, and it's kind of local.
739628	745778	127	A	1.0	And I'm kind of confused as to how those things kind of worked.
745884	747420	128	A	0.40986	Like, how those things.
750350	754166	129	A	1.0	It seems like all the information in a sphere, a sphere could be a Markov blanket.
754198	764494	130	A	1.0	And then on the inside and the outside, they're statistically independent, is that the whole movement on the inside and the outside, because of the Markov blanket, separates those.
764612	768858	131	A	0.99911	But then if this whole body is submerged in this thing that's mutually related.
768954	770820	132	A	0.64954	I'm just confused as to how.
774630	775426	133	A	0.66	I don't know.
775528	777780	134	A	0.99852	I'm confused as to how those things work together.
783370	789800	135	F	0.77699	I'm not sure I understand your question, but I suspect the answer has to do with whose point of view we're talking about.
790890	796490	136	F	0.52462	So, if you are the system that's in.
796560	799290	137	F	0.99955	So let's fix a Markov blanket someplace.
801630	815806	138	F	0.99985	If you're the system on the inside, then all you can see is what's encoded on the blanket, and you have no independent access to what the dynamic says on the outside.
815908	819600	139	F	1.0	So you don't actually know what the dynamics is on the outside.
821830	833430	140	F	0.72	And similarly, if you're on the outside now, if you're somehow able to view the whole system, you can see the whole system as having some joint dynamics.
834250	842870	141	F	0.99993	But if the whole system is isolated, then there isn't anybody on the outside, kind of by definition.
843450	852220	142	F	0.71785	So the idea of a whole dynamics is just a theoretical postulate that we make to make the mathematics make sense.
853550	879860	143	F	1.0	Now, if you move to from the classical formulation to the quantum formulation, then it's possible to prove a very nice theorem, which is that if you're inside a holographic screen, you can't measure the entanglement entropy across the screen.
881910	890360	144	F	0.9992	What that means is that you can't know that your state is conditionally independent of what's going on outside.
890810	900140	145	F	0.9996	So if you're inside a holographic screen, you can't know that you're not entangled with whatever's outside.
901470	906860	146	F	0.9981	So you can't even know whether you have a well defined state in a sense.
908430	929538	147	F	0.94	And sort of, I think the same thing would probably hold true from the point of view inside a Markov blanket, that you wouldn't be able to know whether your Markov blanket had holes in it or something like that.
929704	936790	148	F	1.0	The problem is, in the classical formulation, you assume there's no analog of entanglement.
937530	940310	149	F	0.99738	So there's no analog of entanglement entropy.
940970	951530	150	F	0.99628	So I think the strongest thing you can say is you don't actually know your statistical relationship to what's going on outside, but you still can only see what's encoded on the blanket.
953870	955270	151	B	0.99962	Thank you, Chris.
955430	957798	152	B	0.99993	If I could add a few more pieces.
957974	961070	153	B	0.99119	So, David, you described everything connected to everything.
961220	972734	154	B	0.99989	For a system with that kind of a base graph, there aren't Markov blankets, because a Markov blanket is the set of nodes that make two other sets of nodes conditionally independent.
972862	979426	155	B	0.99728	So in a fully connected setting, again leading to the question, what is outside of that?
979448	983560	156	B	0.99949	But in a fully connected setting, you don't have a blanket as such.
984730	994470	157	B	0.99994	In fact, the Bayesian Graph describes the factorization, or the articulation and the sparsity of the system.
994540	1001866	158	B	0.99751	So it is a connectedness that is usually much, much sparser than everything connected to everything.
1002048	1006170	159	B	0.99998	But that's not to say that differences can't make a difference at a distance.
1006510	1011690	160	B	0.93926	It's just that they propagate through a local causal structure.
1011850	1016862	161	B	1.0	And then Spacetime is constructed by certain kinds of cognitive agents.
1016916	1020580	162	B	0.99998	That was one of the key aspects of this course.
1021590	1032290	163	B	1.0	And so we can take as primary the topology of the active inference agent environment relation.
1033370	1044550	164	B	0.95	And then Markov Blanket is just the sensorium on the inbound and the action capacity on the outbound.
1046190	1058240	165	B	0.99	One question, though, I do have to that is, what about the non zero gravitational effect, for example, of something that's distant in space and time?
1060130	1063482	166	B	1.0	Of course, Markov Blanket don't have to be spatial temporal.
1063546	1065950	167	B	0.99992	They can be in arbitrary state spaces.
1066610	1074370	168	B	0.99992	But how do we deal with those kinds of long range influences?
1079010	1080160	169	A	0.9994	That's my question.
1080530	1081086	170	F	0.97739	Yeah.
1081188	1090610	171	F	0.99747	Well, here I think it's useful to contrast Newtonian gravity with Einsteinian gravity.
1092390	1107030	172	F	0.68154	Newtonian gravity is infinite range and instantaneously acting, whereas Einsteinian gravity is infinite range, but it's locally encoded.
1107850	1122650	173	F	0.92367	So the Einsteinian gravity that you feel is your local measurement of the curvature of your local bit of Spacetime.
1123570	1127854	174	F	0.99725	So that is very much happening on your Markov blanket, right?
1127892	1131594	175	F	0.99847	It's a local measurement, local in Spacetime.
1131642	1148500	176	F	0.99291	So let's assume there's a Spacetime that's objective and characterizes everything, then you're locally measuring it on your blanket, and that's what you feel as gravitational attraction or your mass.
1150630	1160970	177	F	0.97916	Whereas in Newtonian or Laplacian gravity, you don't have that sense of locality, right.
1161040	1164860	178	F	0.99951	As soon as something changes anywhere in the universe, it affects you.
1165710	1180640	179	F	0.90105	So Einstein was struggling, of course, to make gravity consistent with electromagnetism, where it was clear that forces are transmitted at finite speed, the speed of light.
1181170	1189310	180	F	0.99	And he didn't have the idea of a graviton moving at the speed of light, but he did have this idea of local measurement.
1190130	1199010	181	F	0.99025	So non locality was anathema to Einstein, and that's basically why he spent so much trouble removing it from physics.
1199690	1208760	182	F	0.99	And that's why he hated the idea of entanglement so much, because it seemed to him that from a Spacetime point of view, it had to be non local.
1211470	1214410	183	E	0.62711	Daniel, can I bring up a point at this point?
1214560	1223178	184	E	0.99954	So I think this is somewhat relevant to a question I really wanted to ask Chris, which is in lecture six.
1223264	1225118	185	E	0.99	I remember minute 23.
1225284	1246306	186	E	1.0	I wish I had written it down, but I can roughly remember there was that phylogenetic graph, and you see life growing in a self similar way, just like the genealogical tree of species, same thing happens at the individual level with growth and so on.
1246408	1254646	187	E	0.99215	Anyways, I found that fascinated in the sense that the degrees of freedom, of life as a whole grow.
1254748	1255398	188	E	0.99993	Right.
1255564	1261222	189	E	0.94	And around that minute 23, you made a comment, well, then the environment must be shrinking.
1261366	1263110	190	E	1.0	And you tie this with Spacetime.
1263190	1273570	191	E	1.0	And something about Spacetime from the physics side, we also have that we have cosmological inflation and Whatnot.
1273750	1275434	192	E	0.99999	Are any of those things related?
1275562	1281680	193	E	0.99988	That remark, I feel like, was made in passing, and I think there's a lot there to be said.
1283090	1289426	194	E	1.0	It also maybe shed some light on the emergent Spacetime issue.
1289528	1308786	195	E	0.99999	If it does emerge from a more basic ontological object, like the Tensor network and the degrees of freedom in the tensor network, is it fair to say that life, as it grows, gets more of those degrees of freedom, but then somehow anything that happens to Spacetime is an illusion?
1308818	1311562	196	E	0.99991	In that sense, I don't even know if I'm familiar in that question.
1311616	1311834	197	E	0.99733	Right.
1311872	1315260	198	E	0.96573	But I think Chris knows what I'm talking about.
1316590	1328970	199	F	0.95917	Yeah, the comment makes the most sense in the context of the state space itself, leaving aside Spacetime.
1329050	1344340	200	F	0.99795	So if you think of a Hilbert space and draw a boundary someplace that separates what we're going to call life from what we're going to call non life.
1345350	1359880	201	F	1.0	And essentially, what life has done over the past 3 billion years is incorporate bits of the non life part of the state space into life.
1360190	1360940	202	E	0.99364	Right?
1362430	1372300	203	F	0.99998	Total biomass is increasing, so more and more of the available mass is getting incorporated into living things.
1372770	1379040	204	F	0.89	And so if we can kind of heuristically fold Spacetime in and say.
1383890	1384206	205	C	0.9	You.
1384228	1396130	206	F	0.98551	Know, in the, in the, in the locality, in the locale of Earth, and over this fairly short time period, the expansion of Spacetime is more or less negligible.
1397370	1412010	207	F	0.52082	So life is actually taking up more space now than it did certainly at the time of LUCA, when all of us weren't around.
1412080	1417500	208	F	0.99917	But there is just one probably population of cells that we're descendants of.
1420750	1439380	209	F	0.98333	But the point about the Hilbert space is just the point that if you've divided it in two and you move the boundary, then one system gets bigger at the expense of the other system, which now has less of the Hilbert space.
1441830	1447140	210	F	0.99819	So that's all that remark really is, right?
1448810	1456360	211	F	0.90054	As the system, in a sense, takes over degrees of freedom of the.
1458250	1458754	212	E	0.80261	That's.
1458802	1468502	213	F	0.99851	In that case, it becomes a different system at every time step from the point of view of it has now a different Hilbert space and different internal dynamics.
1468566	1470540	214	F	0.9953	So physically it's a different thing.
1471230	1476782	215	F	0.92891	But when we look at it, we say, oh, this thing is continuous through time.
1476916	1482400	216	F	0.99	It is expanding, it's growing, it's developing, evolving, whatever.
1483330	1484080	217	E	0.99993	Right?
1484610	1499358	218	E	0.90628	So then, I guess, comment, just a question that just occurred as you were talking, that begs the question, does that biomass come to dominate all the degrees of freedom in the universe?
1499454	1517290	219	E	0.99958	Is that presumably there's a tension with the rate at which those degrees of freedom are growing and the rate at which Spacetime is growing, does the growth of Spacetime, in terms of those degrees of freedom that may be more fundamental, amount to loss in error correction capacity?
1521070	1527310	220	E	0.65	And maybe more speculatively, how you reconcile this with loss of thermodynamics.
1529170	1535970	221	E	0.99998	Are you implying that life is going to come to dominate everything and fill up the entirety of the known universe?
1538630	1541730	222	F	0.99994	Yeah, I think that's a stretch.
1543590	1560390	223	F	0.99682	But I would say at this point that until we have a mature theory of quantum gravity that makes enough empirical predictions to be testable.
1561790	1588100	224	F	0.99905	It's not clear, at least to me, how the whole emergent Spacetime picture fits together with the inflationary picture or the expanding Spacetime picture, in some sense, taking a strict Hilbert space view.
1589510	1595890	225	F	0.99974	If the universe is an isolated system, then its Hilbert space is fixed.
1597530	1608040	226	F	0.99	And so your question, in a sense, becomes, what's the relationship between Spacetime and this silver space?
1608890	1614780	227	F	0.73107	Are what we think of as Spacetime degrees of freedom, real degrees of freedom, or not?
1616110	1624960	228	F	0.88	And seems to me that question really isn't resolved, and I'm not sure at this point how to resolve it.
1633410	1640160	229	D	0.76615	HArris yeah, just have something small to add.
1642070	1648610	230	D	0.98558	Overall, this is very interesting, and these questions are very deep.
1649670	1663430	231	D	0.99998	What I wanted to add is that I was thinking the initial question regarding Markov Blanket, and I also have some question that it's related with it.
1663500	1666200	232	D	0.9987	But I will ask Chris later.
1666830	1680000	233	D	0.98624	What I wanted to add now is that basically, Markov Blanket are a way of describing the boundaries of a system in terms of statistical mechanics or statistics, let's say.
1680370	1694610	234	D	1.0	And essentially, from what I understand, they are paramount in order to define observers and also the systems under observation.
1695110	1710310	235	D	0.9998	So any physical system that can be seen as an observer with a Markov blanket, let's say, so now, trying to tie it all up with active inference.
1710970	1731098	236	D	0.99957	Well, active inference, as I understand it, it implies that the system is actively referring to its external states from its internal states in an effort to both learn, let's say, and adapt to the environment.
1731274	1738714	237	D	0.67098	So this goes back and ties with this metaphorical link, let's say, with the skin.
1738842	1741890	238	D	0.99996	This is how I understand it.
1742040	1757400	239	D	0.99	And it actually means that a system with a Markov blanket can actually be seen as performing physics as information processing, which is the back of this series that Haris is offering to us.
1757770	1759554	240	D	0.99	And a final comment.
1759602	1761270	241	D	0.99997	In terms of non locality.
1761690	1765522	242	D	0.9869	Non locality can actually be seen as a form of information processing.
1765586	1768460	243	D	0.87375	So this is what I wanted to add.
1776160	1781500	244	F	0.93802	Did you say how non locality is a form of information processing?
1782000	1785230	245	D	0.99986	Yes, this is how I understand it.
1789930	1792950	246	D	0.99297	What do you think about that, Chris?
1800320	1833050	247	F	0.99802	If we put it in terms of entanglement, entanglement is a useful resource for information processing, but it's only a usable resource if it's combined with classical communication, either across time or across space.
1834700	1851612	248	F	0.53205	So entanglement is only useful as a resource if different observers can act locally, I.
1851666	1851932	249	F	0.99	E.
1851986	1858720	250	F	0.99998	Without interfering with each other on the quantum resource.
1860420	1878820	251	F	0.99974	So if you think of entanglement as non locality, if you embed it in Spacetime in that way, then it is useful as a computational resource.
1879880	1895848	252	F	0.63939	But the observers also have to transmit classical communications in a way that fully complies with locality.
1895944	1899192	253	F	0.94778	So in a Bell EPR type experiment.
1899256	1925300	254	F	0.99996	For example, if you have Alice in one lab and Bob in the other lab making measurements of some entangled state, then at some point to know that the state is entangled, they have to send their classical records to each other as classical communication and then deal with those records locally.
1927320	1937800	255	F	0.99994	So in a sense, non locality in that sense is useful for computation, but it's only useful if you also have locality.
1940620	1941464	256	D	0.99926	Great.
1941662	1942570	257	A	0.99999	Thank you.
1944400	1949784	258	D	0.99899	Actually, I'm working on a novel notion.
1949832	1950670	259	C	0.99452	Let's say.
1953440	1961250	260	D	0.99997	That is something like, takes the notion of entanglement and transform it in the following sense.
1961700	1969920	261	D	0.9948	I'm actually thinking of maximum tacklement as a resource for classical computation.
1970080	1974800	262	D	0.96302	So that's something I am actually exploring.
1974960	1978900	263	D	0.69	I find it to be a nice concept.
1981180	1983860	264	F	0.99849	Did you say maximum unentanglement?
1984020	1984776	265	F	0.99997	Yes.
1984958	1986404	266	F	0.99984	Maximum separability?
1986532	1986872	267	E	0.9998	Yeah.
1986926	1988632	268	F	0.9974	Okay, that makes sense.
1988686	1991000	269	F	1.0	I mean, we need maximum separability.
1993680	1998140	270	F	0.99927	We need to be able to factor a state space to talk about two different observers.
1999040	2001820	271	F	0.9492	So to talk about conditional independence.
2003200	2003950	272	D	0.9828	Yeah.
2004960	2017410	273	D	0.99776	In my head, this maximum entanglement as a resource can actually be expended to perform classical computation or even to increase the coherence of a quantum system.
2018100	2021250	274	D	0.99942	So I'm playing with that notion a bit.
2025000	2025990	275	C	0.99973	Thank you.
2030800	2033150	276	A	0.99965	Can I ask one thing really quick about.
2034800	2036750	277	A	0.51706	Yeah, okay.
2038660	2045840	278	A	0.5484	So apparently, from what I don't understand very much, but from Bohr, apparently.
2047720	2047988	279	F	0.96	The.
2047994	2063850	280	A	0.75384	Whole experimental setup was one entity that couldn't be broken down into constituent pieces that are interacting, but had to be taken as one entity, from what I understand, and apparently Einstein's view was.
2065340	2069796	281	A	0.95751	Well, I really don't know what his view was, but apparently it's not one entity.
2069828	2073400	282	A	0.67	It can be broken down into localized pieces that are interacting.
2073740	2076812	283	A	0.95	And apparently they couldn't get along.
2076866	2078380	284	A	0.98691	Like Warren Einstein.
2078960	2084460	285	A	0.99678	Apparently there was like a party or something, and then they all congregate to separate parts of the room and didn't really interact.
2085220	2093884	286	A	1.0	And apparently it was because they had these opposing views on the same thing of breaking down the interconnectedness into separate constituent subsystems.
2093932	2102096	287	A	0.93	And even like taking the partial trace, there was one universal function taking the partial trace, which Puzzley defined the subsystems.
2102128	2106164	288	A	0.88388	Whenever perfectly, it's all tied together.
2106202	2107136	289	A	1.0	But I can't really explicit.
2107168	2108070	290	C	0.68337	I'm trying to say.
2112120	2112870	291	A	0.66827	Everyone.
2115820	2118104	292	A	0.99685	These seem like two very opposed view.
2118222	2120212	293	A	0.99963	They seem like very alternative views.
2120276	2127448	294	A	0.55868	Like on one side you have kind of like an indivisible whole.
2127534	2143440	295	A	0.40042	On the other side you have locality where it's almost like there's like a sequence of measurements leading up to an ego, an eye that then measures as like a real entity, as another one is like the observer and the observed are one thing, they cannot be meaningfully separated.
2144900	2153220	296	A	0.99995	Maybe functionally they can be separated, but as actually existing subcomponents, they cannot be defined strictly.
2154600	2155508	297	A	1.0	From what I understand.
2155594	2160360	298	A	1.0	One of them is saying, yes, you can define these subsystems and they really do exist as separate entities.
2160700	2178590	299	A	1.0	The other one is saying, that's just kind of like a useful way to organize information as to operate on that information, deposit a subject and an object, and to have the subject operate on the object is a useful way for thinking to separate itself.
2179120	2182472	300	A	0.99	And it seems like this is closer to Bohr than the other one is closer.
2182536	2186290	301	A	0.96273	Well, apparently that's a distinction of, like, Boer and Einstein, from what I understand.
2186820	2190530	302	A	0.99981	From what I understand, which is, please correct me if it's.
2192420	2194112	303	A	0.51106	Yeah, I just wanted to put that out there.
2194166	2198950	304	A	0.93	And I don't know what that's going to spawn in terms of responses, but yes.
2199640	2210630	305	F	0.79323	Well, I think that's a fair characterization of the Bohr Einstein debate, actually, to.
2211160	2215492	306	B	1.0	Add a response there, whether it actually exists.
2215636	2230440	307	B	1.0	It seems like in one of those framings, you had an observer looking at something, and if we define actually existing in a relational observed setting, then to the observer the measurement actually exists.
2230520	2232440	308	B	0.82049	Prepare, measure, prepare, measure.
2232600	2241040	309	B	0.99	And then from another perspective, viewing that setup, then it's the observer of a setup.
2242820	2268600	310	B	1.0	And so it's just, again, to Chris's first point about what perspective, and this is one of the most essential pieces that the blanket screen relationality brings into play, is there isn't a view from nowhere, but there is a perspective that may have a definite answer, and yet there are multiple perspectives that have complementary answers in our scenario.
2269820	2271432	311	E	0.98275	Daniel, can I speak for a minute?
2271486	2272200	312	B	0.76	Oh, yeah.
2272350	2273188	313	E	1.0	I was muted earlier.
2273204	2273844	314	E	0.95	I didn't realize.
2273892	2274648	315	E	1.0	I meant to ask.
2274734	2280840	316	E	0.88298	David, I don't have an answer to your question, but I was wondering if you could reformulate.
2281000	2286876	317	E	0.98467	Would it be fair to reformulate your question as saying, are blankets objective or not?
2286978	2290016	318	E	0.99672	Is the Bohr Einstein debate equivalent to that?
2290118	2305040	319	E	1.0	And then second, and I guess this may be for Chris, I was skimming through the answers, and one of them was talking about how one of the big tensions between general relativity and quantum theory is the idea of object persistence.
2305120	2315130	320	E	0.89	And I don't know how to articulate it either, but I feel like it was more or less what you were getting at, David, is that correct?
2316940	2319464	321	A	0.99932	Yeah, I think that's another way to put it.
2319582	2331630	322	A	1.0	And also the thing you said about the third person looking at those systems, if there's multi agent communication, that's kind of the thing that I'm kind of stuck on in terms of trying to understand this.
2332480	2338990	323	A	0.99882	Because if there's a third agent looking okay, those two are subsumed in the information on the holographic screen.
2342020	2342576	324	A	1.0	I don't know.
2342598	2344370	325	A	0.88291	Anyways, so that's where I'm kind of.
2346980	2356500	326	F	1.0	I think a delightful thing to read here is Gene Wigner's paper where he introduces the Wigner's friend thought experiment.
2357320	2360070	327	F	1.0	And I think it's from.
2362860	2365796	328	F	0.95352	There's a book called the Scientist Speculates.
2365908	2370170	329	F	1.0	The editor is someone named Good, good.
2374860	2377356	330	F	0.43	And Wigner has a paper in this book.
2377538	2379790	331	F	0.65	I think it's 1961.
2380880	2393200	332	F	1.0	And it's also the paper where Wigner talks about consciousness being an essential concept in quantum theory.
2393540	2403300	333	F	0.99308	But the thought experiment is that Wigner's friend is doing an experiment in his laboratory and making observations.
2404840	2407300	334	F	0.99	And Wigner is outside the laboratory.
2408200	2418212	335	F	0.94	And Wigner has to regard his friend as in some sort of superposition with his instrument.
2418276	2422280	336	F	0.99972	He has to regard his friend as entangled with his friend's instruments.
2424140	2427724	337	F	0.99961	Until Vignner can actually interact locally with the friend.
2427842	2431070	338	F	1.0	And make a measurement of the friend's state.
2432480	2445070	339	F	0.92	And so it makes Wigner's friend and his apparatus look like an entangled pair.
2445570	2452370	340	F	0.99	And Wigner now looks like an experimenter who's operating on just one part of an entangled pair.
2454550	2459010	341	F	0.99624	But Wigner himself tells the story very nicely.
2460550	2475560	342	F	0.95	And that sort of historical text, I think, is always useful to have a look at and see how the people themselves were responding to this idea.
2476970	2480250	343	F	0.99	And Wigner is quite perplexed by this thought experiment.
2484110	2498862	344	F	0.63	And I think all of those people, they were quite honestly mystified with what observation actually is and what consciousness is.
2498916	2508130	345	F	0.62	And all of these other questions that people are a little bit scared to talk about in the ensuing several decades.
2513700	2515040	346	A	0.99422	Self reference.
2517480	2519030	347	E	0.99753	Yeah, you can go ahead.
2520360	2526260	348	A	0.99946	Self reference seems to be like there's this ancient symbol of the uroboros.
2527000	2528316	349	A	1.0	The output is the input.
2528368	2529770	350	A	1.0	It feeds on itself.
2530460	2532200	351	A	0.71147	Even like consciousness.
2534220	2537960	352	A	1.0	I have to contextualize, to contextualize, like it's self referential.
2538540	2540376	353	A	0.75089	Everything refers to itself.
2540558	2545176	354	A	1.0	And then at the end, self reference is where all the paradoxes are like, this sentence is false.
2545288	2547036	355	A	0.72	Or all I know is that I know nothing.
2547138	2549260	356	A	0.57289	These are all paradoxical statements.
2550800	2554000	357	A	0.99997	So there's some sort of mystery cell division of self reference.
2554740	2559170	358	A	0.9442	That ancient view is that it's like embryogenesis, cosmogenesis, same thing.
2562900	2563970	359	A	1.0	I don't know.
2564900	2567424	360	A	1.0	It seems to me that there's some sort of mystery that's so.
2567462	2568144	361	A	0.57969	It's like the mind.
2568182	2570036	362	A	0.61	It just eludes I don't know.
2570138	2573510	363	A	0.99941	Thinking tries to make these thought systems, but it just slips out.
2574680	2575876	364	A	0.26	I can't grasp it.
2575898	2585112	365	A	0.56	I don't mean, but that's already a conclusion, which I don't necessarily want to even make, because if it's self referenced, that is thinking, OK, then maybe it goes all the way to the bottom.
2585166	2587290	366	F	0.86977	But I don't know.
2588460	2591836	367	E	0.96965	Daniel, can I ask you a question before we run out of time?
2591938	2592924	368	E	0.99926	Actually, I have two.
2592962	2594188	369	E	0.99574	Maybe one is a bit longer.
2594274	2595390	370	E	1.0	The second one.
2596080	2611344	371	E	0.83479	So the first one, Chris, I was very intrigued and looking forward to hear you talk a little bit about that cycle of error correction and memory and persistence and so on.
2611462	2623876	372	E	1.0	And in particular, I was wondering if it relates at all to the main other thing you talked about in that lecture, six, the copy and diversify business.
2623978	2636810	373	E	0.99999	Because intuitively, if that cycle is something that an organism has to implement, I'm talking about that slide with the error correction and whatnot, then it pays the thermodynamic price for it.
2637260	2649624	374	E	0.86023	So presumably there is an anabolic process of trying to grow so you can feed degrees of freedom into this error correcting scheme, thinking like a physicist.
2649672	2651710	375	E	1.0	Something like that might be happening.
2652320	2659116	376	E	0.99991	So is the copy and diversify feature a necessity of having to run this cycle?
2659308	2661970	377	E	0.7537	That's my first question.
2677450	2678582	378	F	0.84339	That's a good question.
2678636	2680390	379	F	1.0	I don't know whether it's necessary.
2687720	2706380	380	F	1.0	I think one could think of a fairly small scale heat engine or metabolic system that can pull just enough free energy out of its environment to store a one bit memory.
2711040	2713964	381	F	1.0	And you can think of something like a flip flop, right?
2714002	2715352	382	F	0.99998	These things aren't alive.
2715496	2732500	383	F	0.99997	So it's not quite as complex as an organism, but it is using energy to maintain a memory, and its memory does influence its behavior.
2734040	2740870	384	F	0.60035	So I think we have these limiting cases like this that don't have to grow.
2743820	2764990	385	F	0.99966	But when you think about organisms, organisms have the problem of being made out of very delicate parts that need to be replaced.
2766450	2778530	386	F	1.0	And it's that degradation that I think is driving this need for constant copying.
2785200	2811100	387	F	1.0	And from a physics point of view, I think what that boils down to is that the organisms living right at the edge of an interaction with its environment that's too strong to maintain.
2812080	2835910	388	F	0.99975	So the environmental interaction is constantly at risk of spinning out of control and having too large an energy transfer, which basically tears the Markov blanket apart and exposes too many of the internal degrees of freedom to the outside.
2839500	2853710	389	F	0.89525	So this may be one way of saying what characterizes life, that it's interacting with its environment right on the edge of an interaction that's too strong.
2854980	2869380	390	F	0.96	And it's great to have a strong interaction because then you have big eigenvalues and so you have large bandwidth, but the risk is that the environment tears you apart.
2876610	2879630	391	B	0.99997	Close to the fire, but don't get burnt.
2880850	2895634	392	B	0.99988	Become the fire and then control the redox balance and gain that autopoietic regulative capacity, which works when it works.
2895832	2896398	393	F	0.99989	Yeah.
2896504	2899190	394	F	0.96118	Until something comes along with bigger teeth.
2903930	2920102	395	E	0.99998	Another comment, if I may, is, as the course comes to an end, two things I realized associated to classicality that we've talked a lot about in this class are object persistence and boundaries.
2920166	2920538	396	E	0.99817	Right?
2920624	2929470	397	E	0.99996	So classicality being a feature, intrinsically boundary related, and having a lot to do with object persistence.
2931170	2939410	398	E	0.63722	So artists just think completely dual from an FEP point of view, because you want to maintain the integrity of the boundary.
2941350	2944050	399	E	1.0	You want to preserve that classical information, presumably.
2944550	2945234	400	E	0.88695	I'm not sure.
2945272	2965286	401	E	1.0	I guess my question to everyone is, are object persistence in the topic of classicality, object persistence and boundaries, are these basically completely dual pictures?
2965398	2966620	402	E	0.99995	That's my question.
2968910	2970810	403	F	0.98136	Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
2972930	2976480	404	F	0.68	And we also need object persistence to define space.
2978770	2992980	405	F	0.99949	So this idea of object persistence is a very key idea that has to be dealt with.
2993830	3001190	406	F	1.0	And physics has largely ignored this idea, which is kind of objects are taken for granted.
3005880	3015976	407	F	0.68749	But I think what Carl says in that 2019 free energy principle for a particular physics paper is fairly clear on this.
3016078	3023320	408	F	0.99556	He basically says the free energy principle tells systems to persist.
3024160	3032140	409	F	0.59982	That's basically what a system has to do by maintaining the integrity of its Markov blanket.
3032800	3035020	410	F	1.0	I think that's very insightful.
3037610	3039960	411	B	0.50324	If it doesn't, it's not.
3040890	3044070	412	F	0.91755	Yeah, it's not a system anymore.
3047210	3062650	413	B	0.99998	Well, as we somewhat glide towards a local closure, of course anyone is welcome to bring up any reflections.
3063330	3075070	414	B	1.0	And also, I'd love to hear about where we go from this now measured outcome.
3075670	3086820	415	B	0.99721	How do we prepare individually at the Institute scale, ecosystem scale, and what are we going to do coming out of this?
3089130	3091080	416	E	0.81514	Are we talking about that right now.
3097520	3098780	417	B	1.0	Or any thoughts?
3099200	3101710	418	E	0.94393	Yeah, keep learning, bro.
3103300	3106160	419	A	0.87616	What do you mean by the ecosystem scale?
3106500	3114240	420	B	0.99637	Like the active inference ecosystem and our own ecosystems going on our own scale.
3114740	3126310	421	E	1.0	I guess the only thing I can comment on this is I echo the view that, or not view, or rather remark that Chris made in the lecture about quantum biology as a field.
3126920	3129190	422	E	0.99923	It's in a nascent stage, right?
3130120	3138520	423	E	0.56301	Mean, I think, you know, there will be a non trivial interaction between the active inference community and quantum biology.
3139260	3142110	424	E	0.99944	I'm making that surmise right now.
3152460	3159832	425	C	0.99007	So let's talk about quantum biology for a second, I'll open up the Pandora's box here.
3159886	3163524	426	C	0.99968	Let's think of it as a parable as opposed, or maybe even fan fiction.
3163572	3167710	427	C	0.98584	Because Chris has shared so much with us, I want to kind of build off of it.
3168320	3171500	428	C	0.99801	If you will indulge me for a second, I'll read you a little story.
3171570	3173150	429	C	0.99966	Just hear the story out.
3174320	3187830	430	C	0.61912	Quantum biology sounds like more than up or down without saying that it is more up or down as what information can be counterfactually is looking at carrying capacity as in quotes can be.
3188760	3191360	431	C	0.99	And from that carrying capacity comes orientation.
3191440	3206520	432	C	1.0	Things like direction and scale, things like the ability to plan appear to fit better in the orientation category relative to the carrying capacity category, which is noncommunativity in action.
3208780	3218430	433	C	0.99995	This is a big if we agree that orientation is to follow should our recognizing of planning affordances follow as well.
3219040	3221384	434	C	0.99703	So from the session slide, there was a quote.
3221512	3229404	435	C	0.99927	Living systems are genetic quantum systems that the FEP has driven to a high level of computational complexity.
3229532	3237776	436	C	1.0	And here the in quotes computation is baked in as something planable with this as a reference frame.
3237808	3240420	437	C	1.0	To make plans, we need carrying capacity.
3240840	3241590	438	C	0.65563	Check.
3242040	3243040	439	C	0.99406	Agreed.
3243200	3253370	440	C	0.99998	But in order to learn where does the carrying capacity plus orientation relationship insist that we start with a received plan?
3254140	3262620	441	C	0.99448	This perspective is compared to, say, actively inferring our way to the plan falls out of carrying capacity.
3263520	3286120	442	C	0.99998	Just making this explicit, we can then ask should we first apply a received plan or apply active inference that helps clarify when the strategy is one more based on exploitation versus a strategy more based and biased to exploration.
3286200	3315160	443	C	0.99999	In summary, when did information delivery things like product or package packaging begin to Trump information carrying capacity, which is essentially information processing rather than we need this paired relationship, the carrying capacity plus the orientation as a minimum of two so that we can compare, identify change and know change model patterns, et cetera.
3315820	3323400	444	C	0.99991	This is another way of asking when did subject matter expertise come to be seen as more valuable than prediction matter expertise?
3323820	3328780	445	C	0.99993	When it seems like we need both capacities if we want independency.
3329120	3330780	446	C	0.98	And here's the kicker.
3331280	3338776	447	C	0.99933	If not given time to reflect on what's being asked here, and I know Chris oftentimes has a nice long pause to reflect.
3338888	3364424	448	C	0.99919	But if not given the time to reflect, people will take their subject matter expertise strategy, which clearly is a next move perspective over one that holds up next move plus all moves, meaning that they bring prediction matter expertise in to follow, to parameterize, to unlock, to unring, to unbound what's in and what's out.
3364622	3369560	449	C	1.0	Of course, without prediction matter expertise, what is quantum biology?
3374080	3374540	450	F	0.9985	Wow.
3374610	3377612	451	F	0.99956	Can you just post that someplace so we can think about.
3377746	3379740	452	C	0.99849	I'll just email it to you, Chris.
3379900	3380610	453	F	0.9952	Cool.
3383300	3384530	454	D	0.99917	That was great.
3390330	3391080	455	E	0.96704	Yeah.
3391450	3401306	456	F	1.0	I think you're asking about the fundamental question of what does Carl call it?
3401488	3408720	457	F	0.97737	Epistemic value and the role of curiosity and that whole cluster of issues.
3411570	3415374	458	C	0.87008	Well, I think I need to give you the credit that you deserve on this.
3415412	3426194	459	C	1.0	I think it's the fact that you have allowed us to interact with you that's given us that kind of courage and confidence to be able to put things out there.
3426232	3428834	460	C	1.0	I don't know how much of it sticks or how much of it.
3428872	3433646	461	C	0.99994	I'm not sure that it requires disciples, but I do think it provides.
3433758	3436870	462	C	1.0	What you've done is provided that medium.
3437450	3440678	463	C	0.9982	So again, I guess that's my way of saying thank you.
3440844	3441798	464	F	0.98443	Well, thank.
3441964	3442870	465	F	0.91521	That's.
3447530	3447894	466	E	0.96479	Yeah.
3447932	3448950	467	E	0.9999	Thank you, Chris.
3449450	3454680	468	E	1.0	I have learned so much this year, more than ever before.
3460050	3461418	469	F	0.74952	Okay, well, great.
3461604	3474620	470	F	0.99246	This has been a great class, and hopefully various things will come out of mean.
3474690	3478508	471	F	0.76782	Certainly just from looking at the questions that have been in the question forum.
3478684	3492070	472	F	0.92913	Lots of people are thinking about these issues, and that's what I think AI needs going forward, is people thinking and talking about stuff.
3495150	3496230	473	B	0.99998	Thank you, Chris.
3496310	3496554	474	E	0.99891	Yeah.
3496592	3508000	475	B	1.0	A few outcomes that we know will transcribe the lectures, the discussions, add in screenshots, add in the Q and A, and publish those proceedings as a book.
3508370	3522450	476	B	0.99998	We will pick back up in 2024 with potentially having the recorded and written contents as part of a curriculum.
3523350	3541370	477	B	0.99998	So not just replicating, but now continuing on with another quantum flow across this now classical artifact, because it's quantum in the moment, and then once it's communicated, it becomes a classic.
3541870	3544140	478	E	0.96	And we have months to prepare that state.
3546190	3547660	479	F	0.95815	All right, great.
3548190	3552220	480	F	0.99265	I'm going to have to sign off, but thank you very much.
3552610	3553790	481	B	0.85741	Thank you, Chris.
3554290	3555150	482	A	0.99267	Thank you.
3555300	3556510	483	D	0.98802	Thank you, Chris.
3557730	3558510	484	F	0.4051	Ciao.
3558850	3559630	485	E	0.68361	Bye.
3560370	3568930	486	B	0.71907	Does anyone else, does anyone else want to make any reflection or comment?
3570950	3581954	487	C	1.0	I just thank everybody that's helped organize, participated in all of the discussions, even the people who showed up at the very end of the discussions, because I really appreciate that.
3582072	3598438	488	C	0.99988	Again, I cannot emphasize enough, when we get a chance to interact with this stuff, when we get to manipulate it, when we're able to ask questions, even though we feel vulnerable, I think that that's when a lot of the really good stuff tends to get consolidated.
3598534	3600380	489	C	0.9999	So thank you to all of you.
3601870	3612990	490	B	0.9674	I'll read some fun comments from the live chat, just the last several, just to recognize some of our great colleagues.
3613730	3619538	491	B	0.97507	Lucrative leadership wrote, yes.
3619624	3620878	492	B	1.0	More on affordances.

3636642	3641530	499	B	1.0	I don't speak this language, but I can definitely hear, understand, and feel it.
3641680	3644202	500	B	0.9959	So thank you, everybody who's watching along.
3644256	3652642	501	B	0.99996	These were all great, and we prepare and measure every day at the institute.
3652726	3678900	502	B	0.99801	So I really do hope that people from all backgrounds, all vectors, all preference and prior sets come engage and not presuppose too much about us or themselves or what can happen when we really do interact and when we take it into the kinds of spaces and timelines that we know we want to be on.
3681990	3684242	503	B	0.99876	All right, thank you.
3684376	3685170	504	B	0.99622	Bye.
