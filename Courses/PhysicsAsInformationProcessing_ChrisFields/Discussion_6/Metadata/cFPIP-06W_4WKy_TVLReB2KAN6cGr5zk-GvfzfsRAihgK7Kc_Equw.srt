1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,490
You.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,280
Hello and welcome, everybody. This is

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,852
physics as information processing.

4
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:16,656
It's October 28, 2023,

5
00:00:16,678 --> 00:00:20,668
and we're in discussion

6
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:24,784
six, so we'll see where and how

7
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:27,800
and when we go. But to begin with,

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,036
thank you for watching. If you're

9
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:33,272
watching live, please feel free to write

10
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:35,672
any questions or comments in the live

11
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:38,660
chat. As this is our last discussion,

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,304
we're going to be probably ranging

13
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:45,036
broadly, so looking forward to

14
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:47,208
people's comments there. Otherwise,

15
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:51,244
perhaps we can all go around first and

16
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:53,696
say hello or just give any thoughts or

17
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:56,930
reflections to get things going.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,824
And then we'll jump into some of the

19
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:01,776
questions and answers and look at some

20
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:05,170
of these great thoughts that have been

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,552
sent and responded to. So perhaps

22
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:12,420
Dean and then Harrison. David,

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,720
any just overall thoughts or comments

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,490
to get us going?

25
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,132
Thanks. Daniel. I guess my overall

26
00:01:22,196 --> 00:01:24,344
impression was that I think that the way

27
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:29,160
that the entire series was organized

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,256
and structured allowed for these kinds

29
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:34,476
of conversations that we're having

30
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:35,580
today, which I think are really

31
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,504
valuable. As you can see on the slide

32
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:42,632
here, I think a lot of question

33
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:46,400
and answer tends to be focused around

34
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,490
what is,

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,676
whereas the conversations that we've

36
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:54,448
had, we can sort of tease that apart a

37
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:56,064
little bit and ask questions around what

38
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:58,352
if? And get into the counterfactual

39
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,196
piece of it and interact around that.

40
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:01,552
And I've really, really appreciated

41
00:02:01,616 --> 00:02:04,884
that. So that's my overall sense that

42
00:02:04,922 --> 00:02:07,670
we haven't left it sort of on the page.

43
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,032
We've actually been able to sort of

44
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:12,936
breathe some life into it through these

45
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:13,800
conversations.

46
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,090
Cool. Haris?

47
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,942
Yeah, I just wanted to say that it was a

48
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:28,126
great series. We all learned a lot, and

49
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,086
we got the opportunity to even ask

50
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:35,780
questions to Chris and

51
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,570
get back some very insightful answers

52
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,250
that they are very helpful in order to,

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,620
let's say, push the envelope forward.

54
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,226
Overall, this has been a great series.

55
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:53,030
I've enjoyed it a lot. And while

56
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,910
conversing with some of my colleagues,

57
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,114
they also enjoyed it. So the feedback is

58
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:03,526
great. And thanks to active Inference

59
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,474
Institute for facilitating this, and to

60
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:10,362
you guys. Thank you. ThanK you

61
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:13,182
and welcome. David, if you want to just

62
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:15,786
begin with, any thoughts or what brought

63
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:17,566
you into the game in the bottom of the

64
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:18,190
9th?

65
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,522
Well, in school,

66
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:30,002
I was actually trying to use free

67
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:33,134
energy to develop some sort of a network

68
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:36,114
of agents that were deciding what

69
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:37,698
information to send and what states to

70
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:39,378
be in based on each other's

71
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:41,640
approximation of each other's states.

72
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,414
So I registered at the beginning, but

73
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:47,266
then I guess life happened and I didn't

74
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:48,920
really cross the page.

75
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,322
Now I'm just kind of opening up to

76
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:57,178
things and participating more in the

77
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:59,146
world that I exist in. And this is a

78
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:02,378
natural. This is really tied to

79
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:05,466
the work that I was doing in school. I

80
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:06,846
don't know if this is a place to ask a

81
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:08,014
question, so I'm. Not going to ask any

82
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:10,202
questions. But that's like the urgent.

83
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:13,438
Let's begin with that. Okay. Yeah, so I

84
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:16,266
was thinking about. I'm still confused

85
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,414
about like Markov Blanket and non

86
00:04:18,462 --> 00:04:19,410
localism.

87
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,074
How would those two. What about work

88
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:27,678
together? Well, like, non localism,

89
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:30,066
seems to me that an entity could be

90
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:34,834
distributed arbitrarily in

91
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:36,306
whatever is. I don't know if the

92
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:38,326
universe is like Spacetime is what is,

93
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:39,974
or if that's just a construction that we

94
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:41,346
create through the information

95
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:43,370
processing and putting relation,

96
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,826
enunciating or rendering the

97
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:50,778
information in a way where it's like all

98
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:52,742
the related components can be mutually

99
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:56,474
distinguished. But the Markov blanket

100
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:58,286
seems to be highly local. I don't know,

101
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:01,178
maybe this is what, like, I'm confused

102
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:02,862
about this. It seems to be highly local,

103
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:05,966
and it seems like everything is

104
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:09,378
connected with everything. So I'm kind

105
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:12,546
of confused about how an entity could be

106
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:15,538
defined with a Markov blanket while at

107
00:05:15,544 --> 00:05:19,046
the same time what seems to be

108
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,982
completely intertwined. Non local,

109
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:24,710
mutually defined.

110
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,382
Yes, Dean, please. So can I just.

111
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:31,878
David, just clarification. Are you

112
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:35,260
thinking that local and non local is

113
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,970
somehow similar to maybe arbitrary?

114
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,480
I'm thinking local is within a volume

115
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,676
and non local is distributed like

116
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,596
a sphere, like a small sphere, where all

117
00:05:55,618 --> 00:05:57,724
the information is within a sphere and

118
00:05:57,762 --> 00:05:58,956
everything within that sphere is

119
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:00,512
causally relevant and Everything without

120
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:05,948
is causally irrelevant. But then I'm

121
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,724
thinking of a Markov blanket as a sphere

122
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:09,264
and everything on the inside is like

123
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,484
independent statistically from

124
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:12,848
everything on the outside. I guess I'm

125
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:16,052
asking around, where do you see that

126
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:18,196
being placed? Do you see that being

127
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:20,180
placed arbitrarily?

128
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,214
When you set that up, whenever you

129
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,618
decide where that boundary exists,

130
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:33,966
are you asking because it's local or

131
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:36,682
it's non local because it's wherever

132
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:39,940
inside and outside is present?

133
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,500
Is the. What's the word I'm looking for?

134
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,106
Are you wondering about how that doesn't

135
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:55,926
seem to be consistent, that 1 minute it

136
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,766
can be here and then the next minute it

137
00:06:57,788 --> 00:07:00,246
can change and arbitrarily end up being

138
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:01,320
in a different place?

139
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,572
It doesn't seem to me that that's the

140
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:15,350
confusion. It's more like,

141
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,796
you know, David Bohm's implicate and

142
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,416
explicated order and the idea that the

143
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:25,332
explicated order is like one hologram.

144
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:27,064
There's like the hollow movement where

145
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:29,528
each layer affects each layer and the

146
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:31,872
explicated is all at once explicate

147
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,670
order, mutual relatedness. I don't know.

148
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,508
I don't know if these words are

149
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:39,630
incoherent completely,

150
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,348
like, and then,

151
00:07:46,354 --> 00:07:49,492
but then the Markov blanket, like, I'm

152
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:53,296
I'm taking the example of my skin. I

153
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:56,704
don't know if that's even good example,

154
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,036
but my skin is like a Markov blanket.

155
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:00,732
But then if everything is mutually

156
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:02,196
related and explicated order, this whole

157
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:03,796
body is submerged in the same field that

158
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:06,676
everything else is submerged in. And in

159
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:08,116
that sense, everything is linked to

160
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:09,844
everything. There's no. I don't know.

161
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:10,630
Like.

162
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,908
Let me try adding a few pieces.

163
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,930
So welcome.

164
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,984
Andrew and Chris will hopefully join,

165
00:08:23,032 --> 00:08:25,230
too. Here we go.

166
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,390
Okay, opening act.

167
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,280
Just to catch up, Chris and Ander

168
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,600
David asked about the Markov blanket

169
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,680
and about if how everything

170
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,576
is connected to everything and how we

171
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:49,076
associate Markov Blanket or the

172
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:52,224
holographic screen with localism and non

173
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:54,868
locality. Do you want to give any quick

174
00:08:54,954 --> 00:08:57,844
thoughts on this, or are you asking. Me

175
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:01,016
if you want to? Either of you could. I

176
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:03,384
don't know. Let's wait a minute for

177
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:04,570
Chris to show up.

178
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,920
Yeah, I'm here now. Yeah,

179
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,770
I'm glad you found the way.

180
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,856
Question. Did you guys go through the

181
00:09:19,878 --> 00:09:22,608
slides of last time, the lecture on.

182
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:25,856
No, no. We just began and started with a

183
00:09:25,878 --> 00:09:28,850
Markov blanket question. Yeah,

184
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,804
I think you wouldn't hurt to talk about

185
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:36,324
that, because a big part of that last

186
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:38,000
lecture was the copy and diversify

187
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,170
notion as a universal feature in

188
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,316
mean, naively, I think know the creation

189
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:50,504
of new boundaries is implicit in there.

190
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:54,456
So maybe Chris can comment, but I

191
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:56,056
also thought it was very worthy of

192
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:58,476
mentioning today. Know, the cycle of

193
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,716
error correction, memory and so on. So

194
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:03,996
those would be my only two comments in

195
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:07,216
the agenda for today. Maybe Chris can

196
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:08,896
say a few words, but I didn't mean to

197
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:11,728
interrupt. So, Markov Blanket, we can

198
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:14,530
pivot it to, I'm sure.

199
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,120
Okay, I think I'm seeing this question.

200
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,004
Is this a question about the definition

201
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,480
of Markov Blanket?

202
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,860
There's something about I can't actually

203
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,188
see the entire. No, it's not a

204
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:31,716
question on my screen. Oh, it's not a

205
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:34,904
question on your. Question on your

206
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:38,170
screen. Right.

207
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,584
But could you tell me what the question

208
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:42,332
is again? Yeah, David, just restate it

209
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:43,710
how you see it.

210
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,684
Well, the question was if

211
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:52,636
everything is mutually connected and

212
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:54,740
mutually defined and interconnected,

213
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,264
and there's non localism in the sense

214
00:10:57,302 --> 00:10:58,556
that everything is mutually connected

215
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:01,424
and mutually defined. And I'm kind of

216
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:04,864
implicitly working with the

217
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:06,524
assumption that the implicit explicit

218
00:11:06,572 --> 00:11:09,056
order makes sense. And the explicit is,

219
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:11,360
like one hologram. And it's lost audio

220
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,710
altogether now.

221
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,132
Oh, I still hear him. Oh, the audio.

222
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:19,880
Chris?

223
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,942
Chris. Yeah,

224
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:30,162
I lost at least half of that audio.

225
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:31,400
Just dropped out.

226
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,600
Try to. Sorry about that.

227
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,198
If everything is kind of explicated,

228
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:41,926
like, if it's information in the brain

229
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,122
is kind of rendering it all at once

230
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:46,538
together, I'm just confused. And the

231
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:49,658
whole body is submerged the

232
00:11:49,664 --> 00:11:52,206
whole body is submerged in it. If I look

233
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:53,486
in the mirror, the whole body is

234
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:57,520
submerged in it, and it's all non local.

235
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,914
By that, I mean it's all connected

236
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:01,506
together and mutually defined and

237
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:04,386
mutually necessary to even make sense of

238
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:07,586
any piece of it, if there is even such a

239
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:09,490
thing as a piece. And I'm wondering.

240
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,426
So thaT's one way of looking at it. And

241
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:14,982
then the other way is, like, the local

242
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:17,366
to me, it seems like there's, like, the

243
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:19,126
skin Markov blanket, and it's kind of

244
00:12:19,148 --> 00:12:23,138
local. And I'm kind of confused

245
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:25,778
as to how those things kind of worked.

246
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:27,420
Like, how those things.

247
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,186
It seems like all the information in a

248
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,878
sphere, a sphere could be a Markov

249
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:36,186
blanket. And then on the inside and the

250
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,622
outside, they're statistically

251
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:40,326
independent, is that the whole movement

252
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:42,334
on the inside and the outside, because

253
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:44,494
of the Markov blanket, separates those.

254
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:46,794
But then if this whole body is submerged

255
00:12:46,842 --> 00:12:48,858
in this thing that's mutually related.

256
00:12:48,954 --> 00:12:50,820
I'm just confused as to how.

257
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,434
I don't know. I'm confused as to how

258
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:57,780
those things work together.

259
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,222
I'm not sure I understand your question,

260
00:13:05,276 --> 00:13:07,414
but I suspect the answer has to do with

261
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:09,800
whose point of view we're talking about.

262
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,230
So, if you

263
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,498
are the system that's in. So let's fix a

264
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,290
Markov blanket someplace.

265
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,980
If you're the system on the inside,

266
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,346
then all you can see is what's encoded

267
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:32,110
on the blanket, and you have

268
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,174
no independent access to what the

269
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:36,286
dynamic says on the outside. So you

270
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:38,606
don't actually know what the dynamics is

271
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:42,926
on the outside. And similarly,

272
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,206
if you're on the outside now, if you're

273
00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:48,754
somehow able to view the whole system,

274
00:13:48,872 --> 00:13:50,850
you can see the whole system as having

275
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,430
some joint dynamics.

276
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,550
But if the whole system is

277
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,598
isolated, then there isn't anybody on

278
00:14:00,604 --> 00:14:04,246
the outside, kind of by definition. So

279
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:07,034
the idea of a whole dynamics is just a

280
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:10,362
theoretical postulate that we make to

281
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,914
make the mathematics make sense. Now,

282
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:18,606
if you move to from

283
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:20,794
the classical formulation to the quantum

284
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:24,494
formulation, then it's possible to

285
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:27,614
prove a very nice theorem, which is that

286
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:31,266
if you're inside a

287
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,660
holographic screen,

288
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,950
you can't measure the entanglement

289
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,860
entropy across the screen.

290
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,800
What that means is that you can't know

291
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,114
that your state is conditionally

292
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:50,360
independent of what's going on outside.

293
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,826
So if you're inside a holographic

294
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:57,450
screen, you can't know that you're not

295
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,140
entangled with whatever's outside.

296
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,980
So you can't even know whether you have

297
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,860
a well defined state in a sense.

298
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,840
And sort of,

299
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,350
I think the same thing would probably

300
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,590
hold true from the point of view inside

301
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,914
a Markov blanket, that you

302
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:26,034
wouldn't be able to know whether your

303
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:28,434
Markov blanket had holes in it or

304
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:30,626
something like that. The problem is, in

305
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:34,306
the classical formulation, you assume

306
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:36,790
there's no analog of entanglement.

307
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,394
So there's no analog of entanglement

308
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:42,406
entropy. So I think the strongest thing

309
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:44,422
you can say is you don't actually know

310
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,486
your statistical relationship to what's

311
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:49,322
going on outside, but you still can only

312
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:51,530
see what's encoded on the blanket.

313
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,474
Thank you, Chris. If I could add a few

314
00:15:56,512 --> 00:15:59,594
more pieces. So, David, you described

315
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:01,534
everything connected to everything. For

316
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:04,190
a system with that kind of a base graph,

317
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,326
there aren't Markov blankets, because a

318
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:09,774
Markov blanket is the set of nodes that

319
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:11,294
make two other sets of nodes

320
00:16:11,342 --> 00:16:13,806
conditionally independent. So in a fully

321
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:18,158
connected setting, again leading

322
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:19,266
to the question, what is outside of

323
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:20,942
that? But in a fully connected setting,

324
00:16:21,006 --> 00:16:23,560
you don't have a blanket as such.

325
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,650
In fact, the Bayesian Graph describes

326
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,210
the factorization, or the articulation

327
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,046
and the sparsity of the system. So it is

328
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:38,554
a connectedness that is usually much,

329
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:41,078
much sparser than everything connected

330
00:16:41,094 --> 00:16:43,194
to everything. But that's not to say

331
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:44,970
that differences can't make a difference

332
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,574
at a distance. It's just that they

333
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,906
propagate through a local causal

334
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:54,462
structure. And then Spacetime is

335
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:56,094
constructed by certain kinds of

336
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:57,646
cognitive agents. That was one of the

337
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:00,580
key aspects of this course.

338
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:05,410
And so we can take as primary

339
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,254
the topology of the active inference

340
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:12,290
agent environment relation.

341
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,026
And then Markov

342
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:20,726
Blanket is just the sensorium on

343
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,526
the inbound and the action capacity on

344
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:27,434
the outbound. One question, though, I do

345
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:30,460
have to that is, what about the non zero

346
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,154
gravitational effect, for example, of

347
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:37,606
something that's distant in space and

348
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:41,722
time? Of course, Markov Blanket

349
00:17:41,786 --> 00:17:43,726
don't have to be spatial temporal. They

350
00:17:43,748 --> 00:17:46,974
can be in arbitrary state spaces. But

351
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:50,450
how do we deal with those kinds of long

352
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,370
range influences?

353
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,840
That's my question. Yeah. Well,

354
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,366
here I think it's useful to contrast

355
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:09,742
Newtonian gravity with Einsteinian

356
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:13,742
gravity. Newtonian gravity

357
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:17,130
is infinite range and instantaneously

358
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,714
acting, whereas Einsteinian

359
00:18:21,762 --> 00:18:25,506
gravity is infinite range, but it's

360
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:31,146
locally encoded. So the

361
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:34,780
Einsteinian gravity that you feel is

362
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,226
your local measurement of the

363
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:41,706
curvature of your local bit of

364
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:44,942
Spacetime. So that is very much

365
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:47,594
happening on your Markov blanket,

366
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:50,830
right? It's a local measurement, local

367
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,278
in Spacetime. So let's assume there's a

368
00:18:53,284 --> 00:18:56,754
Spacetime that's objective and

369
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:58,260
characterizes everything,

370
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,562
then you're locally measuring it on your

371
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:04,898
blanket, and that's what you feel as

372
00:19:05,064 --> 00:19:08,500
gravitational attraction or your mass.

373
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,874
Whereas in Newtonian or Laplacian

374
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:15,750
gravity,

375
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,446
you don't have that sense of locality,

376
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:22,394
right. As soon as something changes

377
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:24,214
anywhere in the universe, it affects

378
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:28,250
you. So Einstein

379
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,482
was struggling, of course, to make

380
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:33,338
gravity consistent with

381
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:35,742
electromagnetism, where it was clear

382
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:39,002
that forces are transmitted at finite

383
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:41,978
speed, the speed of light. And he didn't

384
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:43,966
have the idea of a graviton moving at

385
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:47,582
the speed of light, but he did have this

386
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:50,790
idea of local measurement. So non

387
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,066
locality was anathema to Einstein, and

388
00:19:54,088 --> 00:19:57,074
that's basically why he spent so much

389
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,006
trouble removing it from physics. And

390
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:01,686
that's why he hated the idea of

391
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,146
entanglement so much, because it seemed

392
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:07,158
to him that from a Spacetime point of

393
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,760
view, it had to be non local.

394
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,866
Daniel, can I bring up a point at this

395
00:20:13,888 --> 00:20:17,334
point? So I think this is somewhat

396
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,666
relevant to a question I really wanted

397
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:23,178
to ask Chris, which is in lecture six.

398
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,966
I remember minute 23. I wish I had

399
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:27,594
written it down, but I can roughly

400
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:31,550
remember there was that

401
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,586
phylogenetic graph, and you see life

402
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,906
growing in a self similar way,

403
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:41,566
just like the genealogical tree

404
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:44,146
of species, same thing happens at the

405
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:46,306
individual level with growth and so on.

406
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:49,606
Anyways, I found that fascinated in the

407
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:52,742
sense that the degrees of freedom, of

408
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:56,262
life as a whole grow. Right. And around

409
00:20:56,316 --> 00:20:58,242
that minute 23, you made a comment,

410
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:00,506
well, then the environment must be

411
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:02,506
shrinking. And you tie this with

412
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:06,650
Spacetime. And something about Spacetime

413
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,420
from the physics side, we also have that

414
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,826
we have cosmological inflation and

415
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:14,782
Whatnot. Are any of those things

416
00:21:14,836 --> 00:21:18,254
related? That remark, I feel like, was

417
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:19,838
made in passing, and I think there's a

418
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:24,046
lot there to be said. It also maybe

419
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:27,826
shed some light on the

420
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:30,500
emergent Spacetime issue. If it does

421
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,614
emerge from a more basic ontological

422
00:21:33,662 --> 00:21:36,674
object, like the Tensor network and the

423
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,366
degrees of freedom in the tensor

424
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,550
network, is it fair to say that life,

425
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,106
as it grows, gets more of those degrees

426
00:21:43,138 --> 00:21:46,982
of freedom, but then somehow anything

427
00:21:47,036 --> 00:21:48,438
that happens to Spacetime is an

428
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:50,346
illusion? In that sense, I don't even

429
00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:51,562
know if I'm familiar in that question.

430
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:54,406
Right. But I think Chris knows what I'm

431
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,340
talking about. Yeah,

432
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,894
the comment makes the most sense in the

433
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:06,174
context of the state space itself,

434
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:10,160
leaving aside Spacetime. So if you

435
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,986
think of a Hilbert space and draw

436
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:19,810
a boundary someplace that separates

437
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,466
what we're going to call life from what

438
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:26,100
we're going to call non life. And

439
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,886
essentially, what life has done over the

440
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:35,810
past 3 billion years is incorporate

441
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,942
bits of the non life part of the state

442
00:22:37,996 --> 00:22:40,940
space into life. Right?

443
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,050
Total biomass is increasing,

444
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,322
so more and more of the available mass

445
00:22:49,456 --> 00:22:51,610
is getting incorporated into living

446
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,454
things. And so if we can

447
00:22:55,492 --> 00:22:58,062
kind of heuristically fold Spacetime in

448
00:22:58,116 --> 00:22:59,040
and say.

449
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,506
You. Know, in the, in the, in the

450
00:23:05,528 --> 00:23:07,746
locality, in the locale of Earth, and

451
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:09,970
over this fairly short time period,

452
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,946
the expansion of Spacetime is more or

453
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:18,582
less negligible. So life

454
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:21,720
is actually taking up more space now

455
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:26,630
than it did certainly

456
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,200
at the time of LUCA, when all of us

457
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,610
weren't around. But there is just one

458
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,294
probably population of cells that we're

459
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:37,500
descendants of.

460
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,480
But the point about the Hilbert space

461
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,246
is just the point that if

462
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:52,462
you've divided it in two and you move

463
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:55,154
the boundary, then one system gets

464
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:56,754
bigger at the expense of the other

465
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:58,338
system, which now has less of the

466
00:23:58,344 --> 00:23:59,380
Hilbert space.

467
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,258
So that's all that remark really is,

468
00:24:06,424 --> 00:24:10,040
right? As the system,

469
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,614
in a sense, takes over degrees of

470
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:16,360
freedom of the.

471
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,058
That's. In that case, it becomes a

472
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,866
different system at every time step from

473
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:25,706
the point of view of it has now a

474
00:24:25,728 --> 00:24:27,370
different Hilbert space and different

475
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,626
internal dynamics. So physically it's a

476
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:33,326
different thing. But when we

477
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,374
look at it, we say, oh, this thing is

478
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:38,126
continuous through time. It is

479
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,026
expanding, it's growing, it's

480
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:42,400
developing, evolving, whatever.

481
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,074
Right? So then, I guess,

482
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:48,706
comment, just a question that just

483
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:51,518
occurred as you were talking, that begs

484
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:54,978
the question, does that biomass come to

485
00:24:54,984 --> 00:24:58,578
dominate all the degrees of freedom in

486
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:01,666
the universe? Is that presumably there's

487
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:04,486
a tension with the rate at which those

488
00:25:04,508 --> 00:25:06,198
degrees of freedom are growing and the

489
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,066
rate at which Spacetime is growing,

490
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:10,694
does the growth of Spacetime, in terms

491
00:25:10,732 --> 00:25:12,098
of those degrees of freedom that may be

492
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:15,562
more fundamental, amount to loss in

493
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:17,290
error correction capacity?

494
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,566
And maybe more speculatively, how you

495
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,238
reconcile this with loss of

496
00:25:26,244 --> 00:25:27,310
thermodynamics.

497
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,718
Are you implying that life is going to

498
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:32,686
come to dominate everything and fill up

499
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:35,970
the entirety of the known universe?

500
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,730
Yeah, I think that's a stretch.

501
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:50,646
But I

502
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:53,174
would say at this point that until we

503
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:56,562
have a mature theory of quantum gravity

504
00:25:56,626 --> 00:25:59,154
that makes enough empirical predictions

505
00:25:59,202 --> 00:26:02,940
to be testable. It's not

506
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,786
clear, at least to me, how the

507
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:11,894
whole emergent Spacetime picture fits

508
00:26:11,942 --> 00:26:16,010
together with the inflationary

509
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,202
picture or the expanding Spacetime

510
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:18,990
picture,

511
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,006
in some sense, taking a strict Hilbert

512
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,754
space view. If the universe is

513
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:34,446
an isolated system, then its Hilbert

514
00:26:34,478 --> 00:26:35,890
space is fixed.

515
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,600
And so your question,

516
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,086
in a sense, becomes, what's the

517
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:46,966
relationship between Spacetime and this

518
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:50,474
silver space? Are what we

519
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:52,266
think of as Spacetime degrees of

520
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,186
freedom, real degrees of freedom, or

521
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:59,274
not? And seems

522
00:26:59,312 --> 00:27:00,742
to me that question really isn't

523
00:27:00,806 --> 00:27:03,646
resolved, and I'm not sure at this point

524
00:27:03,668 --> 00:27:04,960
how to resolve it.

525
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:18,430
HArris yeah, just have

526
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,160
something small to add.

527
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,714
Overall, this is very interesting, and

528
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:28,610
these questions are very deep.

529
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,740
What I wanted to add is that I was

530
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,386
thinking the initial question regarding

531
00:27:36,498 --> 00:27:39,720
Markov Blanket, and I also have some

532
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,782
question that it's related with it. But

533
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:47,258
I will ask Chris later. What I

534
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:50,298
wanted to add now is that basically,

535
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:52,934
Markov Blanket are a way of describing

536
00:27:52,982 --> 00:27:56,106
the boundaries of a system in terms of

537
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,074
statistical mechanics or statistics,

538
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:02,750
let's say. And essentially,

539
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,400
from what I understand, they are

540
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:11,158
paramount in order to define observers

541
00:28:11,354 --> 00:28:14,610
and also the systems under observation.

542
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,978
So any physical system that can be seen

543
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:22,638
as an observer with a Markov

544
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,454
blanket, let's say, so now, trying to

545
00:28:26,492 --> 00:28:30,310
tie it all up with active inference.

546
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,878
Well, active inference, as I understand

547
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,694
it, it implies that the system is

548
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:40,354
actively referring to its external

549
00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:44,326
states from its internal states in an

550
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:48,038
effort to both learn, let's say,

551
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:51,098
and adapt to the environment.

552
00:28:51,274 --> 00:28:54,382
So this goes

553
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:56,986
back and ties with this metaphorical

554
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:59,294
link, let's say, with the skin. This is

555
00:28:59,332 --> 00:29:02,946
how I understand it. And it

556
00:29:02,968 --> 00:29:05,746
actually means that a system with a

557
00:29:05,768 --> 00:29:09,202
Markov blanket can actually be seen as

558
00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:11,586
performing physics as information

559
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:13,966
processing, which is the back of this

560
00:29:14,008 --> 00:29:17,400
series that Haris is offering to us.

561
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,338
And a final comment. In terms of non

562
00:29:20,354 --> 00:29:23,366
locality. Non locality can actually be

563
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:24,774
seen as a form of information

564
00:29:24,892 --> 00:29:27,834
processing. So this is what I wanted to

565
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:28,460
add.

566
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,692
Did you say how non locality is a form

567
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:42,652
of information processing? Yes,

568
00:29:42,786 --> 00:29:45,230
this is how I understand it.

569
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,950
What do you think about that, Chris?

570
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,852
If we put it in

571
00:30:03,906 --> 00:30:06,060
terms of entanglement,

572
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,988
entanglement is a useful

573
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:16,240
resource for information processing,

574
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,564
but it's only a usable resource if

575
00:30:22,602 --> 00:30:25,840
it's combined with classical

576
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,230
communication, either across time or

577
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,050
across space.

578
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,804
So entanglement

579
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:43,210
is only useful as a resource if

580
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:49,660
different observers can act locally,

581
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,644
I. E. Without interfering with each

582
00:30:53,682 --> 00:30:57,312
other on the

583
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:58,720
quantum resource.

584
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,656
So if

585
00:31:04,678 --> 00:31:06,876
you think of entanglement as non

586
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:09,664
locality, if you embed it in Spacetime

587
00:31:09,712 --> 00:31:14,452
in that way, then it

588
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:17,920
is useful as a computational

589
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,504
resource. But the observers also

590
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:26,680
have to transmit

591
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,584
classical communications in

592
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:34,856
a way that fully complies

593
00:31:34,888 --> 00:31:38,376
with locality. So in a Bell EPR

594
00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:41,036
type experiment. For example, if you

595
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:43,868
have Alice in one lab and Bob in the

596
00:31:43,874 --> 00:31:47,632
other lab making measurements of some

597
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:52,256
entangled state, then at some point to

598
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:55,232
know that the state is entangled, they

599
00:31:55,286 --> 00:31:58,524
have to send their classical records to

600
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:02,688
each other as classical communication

601
00:32:02,784 --> 00:32:04,416
and then deal with those records

602
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:05,300
locally.

603
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,950
So in a sense,

604
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,224
non locality in that sense is useful for

605
00:32:13,262 --> 00:32:16,264
computation, but it's only useful if you

606
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:17,800
also have locality.

607
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,570
Great. Thank you.

608
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,316
Actually, I'm working on

609
00:32:28,338 --> 00:32:30,670
a novel notion. Let's say.

610
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,636
That is something like, takes the notion

611
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:40,176
of entanglement and transform it in the

612
00:32:40,198 --> 00:32:42,880
following sense. I'm actually thinking

613
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:47,024
of maximum tacklement as

614
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:49,920
a resource for classical computation.

615
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,812
So that's something I am actually

616
00:32:53,866 --> 00:32:57,716
exploring. I find it to be a

617
00:32:57,738 --> 00:32:58,900
nice concept.

618
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,860
Did you say maximum unentanglement?

619
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,872
Yes. Maximum separability? Yeah.

620
00:33:06,926 --> 00:33:09,480
Okay, that makes sense. I mean, we need

621
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,000
maximum separability.

622
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,484
We need to be able to factor a state

623
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:17,180
space to talk about two different

624
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,760
observers. So to talk about conditional

625
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,820
independence.

626
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,212
Yeah. In my head, this maximum

627
00:33:27,276 --> 00:33:29,920
entanglement as a resource can actually

628
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,732
be expended to perform classical

629
00:33:32,796 --> 00:33:34,736
computation or even to increase the

630
00:33:34,758 --> 00:33:37,410
coherence of a quantum system.

631
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,250
So I'm playing with that notion a bit.

632
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,990
Thank you.

633
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,150
Can I ask one thing really quick about.

634
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,750
Yeah, okay.

635
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,756
So apparently, from what I don't

636
00:34:01,788 --> 00:34:04,908
understand very much, but from Bohr,

637
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:08,896
apparently. The. Whole experimental

638
00:34:08,928 --> 00:34:12,020
setup was one entity

639
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,452
that couldn't be broken down into

640
00:34:16,506 --> 00:34:18,288
constituent pieces that are interacting,

641
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:19,736
but had to be taken as one entity, from

642
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,180
what I understand, and apparently

643
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,136
Einstein's view was. Well, I really

644
00:34:26,158 --> 00:34:28,216
don't know what his view was, but

645
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:30,296
apparently it's not one entity. It can

646
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:32,068
be broken down into localized pieces

647
00:34:32,084 --> 00:34:35,976
that are interacting. And apparently

648
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,416
they couldn't get along. Like Warren

649
00:34:37,448 --> 00:34:39,948
Einstein. Apparently there was like a

650
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:41,516
party or something, and then they all

651
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,084
congregate to separate parts of the room

652
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,584
and didn't really interact. And

653
00:34:45,622 --> 00:34:46,960
apparently it was because they had these

654
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,792
opposing views on the same thing of

655
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:51,884
breaking down the interconnectedness

656
00:34:51,932 --> 00:34:53,884
into separate constituent subsystems.

657
00:34:53,932 --> 00:34:56,320
And even like taking the partial trace,

658
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,524
there was one universal function taking

659
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:01,328
the partial trace, which Puzzley defined

660
00:35:01,344 --> 00:35:04,260
the subsystems. Whenever perfectly,

661
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,608
it's all tied together. But I can't

662
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,070
really explicit. I'm trying to say.

663
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,870
Everyone.

664
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,104
These seem like two very opposed view.

665
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:20,212
They seem like very alternative views.

666
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:24,344
Like on one side you have kind

667
00:35:24,382 --> 00:35:27,788
of like an indivisible whole. On the

668
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,328
other side you have locality where it's

669
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:31,548
almost like there's like a sequence of

670
00:35:31,554 --> 00:35:33,564
measurements leading up to an ego, an

671
00:35:33,602 --> 00:35:36,192
eye that then measures as like a real

672
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:39,568
entity, as another one is like the

673
00:35:39,574 --> 00:35:41,296
observer and the observed are one thing,

674
00:35:41,318 --> 00:35:43,440
they cannot be meaningfully separated.

675
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,268
Maybe functionally they can be

676
00:35:46,294 --> 00:35:50,384
separated, but as actually existing

677
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:52,336
subcomponents, they cannot be defined

678
00:35:52,368 --> 00:35:55,908
strictly. From what I understand. One of

679
00:35:55,914 --> 00:35:57,568
them is saying, yes, you can define

680
00:35:57,584 --> 00:35:58,936
these subsystems and they really do

681
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:01,128
exist as separate entities. The other

682
00:36:01,134 --> 00:36:03,130
one is saying, that's just kind of like

683
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,424
a useful way to organize information as

684
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,884
to operate on that information, deposit

685
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:14,408
a subject and an object, and to have the

686
00:36:14,414 --> 00:36:16,348
subject operate on the object is a

687
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:17,944
useful way for thinking to separate

688
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:21,128
itself. And it seems like this is closer

689
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:22,472
to Bohr than the other one is closer.

690
00:36:22,536 --> 00:36:24,456
Well, apparently that's a distinction

691
00:36:24,488 --> 00:36:25,696
of, like, Boer and Einstein, from what I

692
00:36:25,718 --> 00:36:27,904
understand. From what I understand,

693
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:30,530
which is, please correct me if it's.

694
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,856
Yeah, I just wanted to put that out

695
00:36:33,878 --> 00:36:36,236
there. And I don't know what that's

696
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:38,144
going to spawn in terms of responses,

697
00:36:38,192 --> 00:36:41,572
but yes. Well, I think that's a fair

698
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:43,744
characterization of the Bohr Einstein

699
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:44,790
debate, actually,

700
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,970
to. Add a response there,

701
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,104
whether it actually exists. It seems

702
00:36:56,142 --> 00:36:58,888
like in one of those framings, you had

703
00:36:59,054 --> 00:37:01,368
an observer looking at something, and if

704
00:37:01,374 --> 00:37:03,496
we define actually existing in a

705
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:07,436
relational observed setting, then to

706
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,964
the observer the measurement actually

707
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:11,784
exists. Prepare, measure, prepare,

708
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:14,652
measure. And then from another

709
00:37:14,786 --> 00:37:17,260
perspective, viewing that setup,

710
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,040
then it's the observer of a setup.

711
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,324
And so it's just, again, to Chris's

712
00:37:25,372 --> 00:37:27,584
first point about what perspective, and

713
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:30,340
this is one of the most essential pieces

714
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,504
that the blanket screen relationality

715
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:35,124
brings into play, is there isn't a view

716
00:37:35,162 --> 00:37:38,740
from nowhere, but there is a perspective

717
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,284
that may have a definite answer,

718
00:37:43,482 --> 00:37:45,364
and yet there are multiple perspectives

719
00:37:45,412 --> 00:37:47,704
that have complementary answers in our

720
00:37:47,742 --> 00:37:51,208
scenario. Daniel, can I speak for a

721
00:37:51,214 --> 00:37:53,188
minute? Oh, yeah. I was muted earlier.

722
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,648
I didn't realize. I meant to ask.

723
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:56,924
David, I don't have an answer to your

724
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:59,676
question, but I was wondering if you

725
00:37:59,698 --> 00:38:01,916
could reformulate. Would it be fair to

726
00:38:01,938 --> 00:38:03,900
reformulate your question as saying,

727
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,308
are blankets objective or not? Is the

728
00:38:07,314 --> 00:38:10,016
Bohr Einstein debate equivalent to that?

729
00:38:10,118 --> 00:38:12,048
And then second, and I guess this may be

730
00:38:12,134 --> 00:38:14,496
for Chris, I was skimming through the

731
00:38:14,518 --> 00:38:17,392
answers, and one of them was talking

732
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:20,252
about how one of the big tensions

733
00:38:20,316 --> 00:38:22,464
between general relativity and quantum

734
00:38:22,512 --> 00:38:24,340
theory is the idea of object

735
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,236
persistence. And I don't know how to

736
00:38:27,258 --> 00:38:30,916
articulate it either, but I feel like it

737
00:38:30,938 --> 00:38:32,404
was more or less what you were getting

738
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:35,130
at, David, is that correct?

739
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,984
Yeah, I think that's another way to put

740
00:38:39,022 --> 00:38:40,904
it. And also the thing you said about

741
00:38:40,942 --> 00:38:42,264
the third person looking at those

742
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:44,008
systems, if there's multi agent

743
00:38:44,174 --> 00:38:45,240
communication,

744
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,148
that's kind of the thing that I'm kind

745
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:50,476
of stuck on in terms of trying to

746
00:38:50,498 --> 00:38:53,388
understand this. Because if there's a

747
00:38:53,394 --> 00:38:54,924
third agent looking okay, those two are

748
00:38:54,962 --> 00:38:57,612
subsumed in the information on the

749
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:58,990
holographic screen.

750
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,456
I don't know. Anyways, so that's where

751
00:39:03,478 --> 00:39:04,370
I'm kind of.

752
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,152
I think a delightful thing to read here

753
00:39:09,206 --> 00:39:12,836
is Gene Wigner's paper

754
00:39:12,938 --> 00:39:15,220
where he introduces the Wigner's friend

755
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:19,200
thought experiment. And I think it's

756
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,416
from. There's a

757
00:39:23,438 --> 00:39:25,796
book called the Scientist Speculates.

758
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:28,330
The editor is someone named Good,

759
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,170
good.

760
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,836
And Wigner has a paper in this book. I

761
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:42,952
think it's 1961. And it's

762
00:39:43,016 --> 00:39:46,616
also the paper where Wigner

763
00:39:46,648 --> 00:39:49,980
talks about consciousness

764
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,476
being an essential concept in quantum

765
00:39:52,508 --> 00:39:55,970
theory. But the thought experiment is

766
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,548
that Wigner's friend is doing an

767
00:39:59,574 --> 00:40:02,292
experiment in his laboratory and making

768
00:40:02,346 --> 00:40:05,796
observations. And Wigner is

769
00:40:05,818 --> 00:40:07,300
outside the laboratory.

770
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,604
And Wigner has

771
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,984
to regard his friend as in some sort of

772
00:40:15,022 --> 00:40:18,456
superposition with his instrument. He

773
00:40:18,478 --> 00:40:20,644
has to regard his friend as entangled

774
00:40:20,692 --> 00:40:22,280
with his friend's instruments.

775
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,312
Until Vignner can actually interact

776
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:28,428
locally with the friend. And make a

777
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:31,070
measurement of the friend's state.

778
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:40,346
And so it makes Wigner's

779
00:40:40,378 --> 00:40:43,694
friend and his apparatus look like an

780
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:47,150
entangled pair. And Wigner now

781
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,354
looks like an experimenter who's

782
00:40:49,402 --> 00:40:51,186
operating on just one part of an

783
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,370
entangled pair.

784
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:58,162
But Wigner himself tells the story very

785
00:40:58,216 --> 00:41:02,962
nicely. And that

786
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:06,390
sort of historical text,

787
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,646
I think, is always useful to have a look

788
00:41:08,668 --> 00:41:11,320
at and see how the people themselves

789
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,560
were responding to this idea.

790
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,114
And Wigner is quite perplexed by this

791
00:41:19,152 --> 00:41:20,250
thought experiment.

792
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,540
And I think all of those people,

793
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,742
they were quite honestly mystified with

794
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:35,280
what observation actually is and what

795
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,142
consciousness is. And all of these other

796
00:41:40,196 --> 00:41:42,914
questions that people are a little bit

797
00:41:42,952 --> 00:41:46,830
scared to talk about in the ensuing

798
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,130
several decades.

799
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,040
Self reference.

800
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,312
Yeah, you can go ahead. Self reference

801
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:04,416
seems to be like there's this ancient

802
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:07,796
symbol of the uroboros. The output is

803
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:11,192
the input. It feeds on itself. Even like

804
00:42:11,246 --> 00:42:15,364
consciousness. I have to contextualize,

805
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:17,064
to contextualize, like it's self

806
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:19,704
referential. Everything refers to

807
00:42:19,742 --> 00:42:21,784
itself. And then at the end, self

808
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:23,564
reference is where all the paradoxes are

809
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:25,948
like, this sentence is false. Or all I

810
00:42:25,954 --> 00:42:27,596
know is that I know nothing. These are

811
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:31,368
all paradoxical statements. So there's

812
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:32,908
some sort of mystery cell division of

813
00:42:32,914 --> 00:42:35,888
self reference. That ancient view is

814
00:42:35,894 --> 00:42:37,244
that it's like embryogenesis,

815
00:42:37,292 --> 00:42:39,170
cosmogenesis, same thing.

816
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,808
I don't know. It seems to me that

817
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,424
there's some sort of mystery that's so.

818
00:42:47,462 --> 00:42:49,508
It's like the mind. It just eludes I

819
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:51,396
don't know. Thinking tries to make these

820
00:42:51,418 --> 00:42:53,510
thought systems, but it just slips out.

821
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,116
I can't grasp it. I don't mean,

822
00:42:58,138 --> 00:43:00,036
but that's already a conclusion, which I

823
00:43:00,058 --> 00:43:01,556
don't necessarily want to even make,

824
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:02,856
because if it's self referenced, that is

825
00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:04,488
thinking, OK, then maybe it goes all the

826
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:07,290
way to the bottom. But I don't know.

827
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,580
Daniel, can I ask you a question before

828
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,652
we run out of time? Actually, I have

829
00:43:12,706 --> 00:43:14,476
two. Maybe one is a bit longer. The

830
00:43:14,498 --> 00:43:17,804
second one. So the

831
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:20,940
first one, Chris, I was very

832
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,824
intrigued and looking forward to hear

833
00:43:23,942 --> 00:43:26,640
you talk a little bit about that cycle

834
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,792
of error correction and memory and

835
00:43:29,926 --> 00:43:32,176
persistence and so on. And in

836
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:35,376
particular, I was wondering if it

837
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:37,876
relates at all to the main other thing

838
00:43:37,898 --> 00:43:40,100
you talked about in that lecture, six,

839
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,876
the copy and diversify business.

840
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:47,204
Because intuitively, if that cycle is

841
00:43:47,242 --> 00:43:49,256
something that an organism has to

842
00:43:49,278 --> 00:43:52,036
implement, I'm talking about that slide

843
00:43:52,068 --> 00:43:54,180
with the error correction and whatnot,

844
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,216
then it pays the thermodynamic price for

845
00:43:56,238 --> 00:44:00,052
it. So presumably

846
00:44:00,116 --> 00:44:02,764
there is an anabolic process of trying

847
00:44:02,802 --> 00:44:04,316
to grow so you can feed degrees of

848
00:44:04,338 --> 00:44:06,424
freedom into this error correcting

849
00:44:06,472 --> 00:44:09,624
scheme, thinking like a physicist.

850
00:44:09,672 --> 00:44:11,710
Something like that might be happening.

851
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,708
So is the copy and diversify feature

852
00:44:15,804 --> 00:44:19,116
a necessity of having to run this cycle?

853
00:44:19,308 --> 00:44:21,970
That's my first question.

854
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,126
That's a good question. I don't know

855
00:44:39,148 --> 00:44:40,390
whether it's necessary.

856
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,396
I think one could think of a

857
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:54,456
fairly small scale heat engine or

858
00:44:54,478 --> 00:44:57,720
metabolic system that can pull

859
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,352
just enough free energy out of its

860
00:45:01,406 --> 00:45:05,196
environment to store a

861
00:45:05,218 --> 00:45:06,380
one bit memory.

862
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,068
And you can think of something like a

863
00:45:13,074 --> 00:45:14,696
flip flop, right? These things aren't

864
00:45:14,728 --> 00:45:18,610
alive. So it's not quite as

865
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:24,512
complex as an organism, but it

866
00:45:24,566 --> 00:45:27,600
is using energy to maintain a memory,

867
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,652
and its memory does influence its

868
00:45:31,706 --> 00:45:35,284
behavior. So I think we have

869
00:45:35,322 --> 00:45:37,796
these limiting cases like this that

870
00:45:37,898 --> 00:45:40,870
don't have to grow.

871
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,936
But when

872
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:49,240
you think about organisms,

873
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,414
organisms have the

874
00:46:00,452 --> 00:46:02,222
problem of being made out of very

875
00:46:02,276 --> 00:46:04,990
delicate parts that need to be replaced.

876
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,998
And it's that degradation

877
00:46:11,114 --> 00:46:15,230
that I think is driving

878
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,530
this need for constant copying.

879
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,944
And from

880
00:46:31,982 --> 00:46:35,064
a physics point of view, I think

881
00:46:35,102 --> 00:46:38,490
what that boils down to is that

882
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,940
the organisms living right at the edge

883
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,744
of an interaction with its environment

884
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:51,100
that's too strong to maintain.

885
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,236
So the environmental

886
00:46:55,288 --> 00:46:59,964
interaction is constantly

887
00:47:00,012 --> 00:47:02,992
at risk of spinning out of control and

888
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:06,130
having too large an energy transfer,

889
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,696
which basically tears the Markov blanket

890
00:47:09,728 --> 00:47:13,268
apart and exposes too many of

891
00:47:13,274 --> 00:47:15,284
the internal degrees of freedom to the

892
00:47:15,322 --> 00:47:15,910
outside.

893
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,292
So this may be

894
00:47:23,346 --> 00:47:25,880
one way of saying what characterizes

895
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,972
life, that it's interacting with its

896
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:31,964
environment right on the edge of an

897
00:47:32,002 --> 00:47:33,710
interaction that's too strong.

898
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,192
And it's great to have a strong

899
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:40,992
interaction because then you have big

900
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:42,992
eigenvalues and so you have large

901
00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:44,000
bandwidth,

902
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,064
but the risk is that the environment

903
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:49,380
tears you apart.

904
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:59,630
Close to the fire, but don't get burnt.

905
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,694
Become the fire and then control the

906
00:48:03,732 --> 00:48:07,374
redox balance and

907
00:48:07,412 --> 00:48:10,398
gain that autopoietic regulative

908
00:48:10,494 --> 00:48:11,490
capacity,

909
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:16,870
which works when it works. Yeah. Until

910
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,190
something comes along with bigger teeth.

911
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:26,920
Another comment, if I may, is,

912
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:31,354
as the course comes to an end, two

913
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:33,114
things I realized associated to

914
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:35,546
classicality that we've talked a lot

915
00:48:35,568 --> 00:48:38,378
about in this class are object

916
00:48:38,464 --> 00:48:40,874
persistence and boundaries. Right? So

917
00:48:40,912 --> 00:48:42,590
classicality being a feature,

918
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,494
intrinsically boundary related, and

919
00:48:46,612 --> 00:48:48,366
having a lot to do with object

920
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:52,206
persistence. So artists just

921
00:48:52,228 --> 00:48:55,506
think completely dual from an FEP point

922
00:48:55,528 --> 00:48:57,646
of view, because you want to maintain

923
00:48:57,678 --> 00:48:59,410
the integrity of the boundary.

924
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:02,734
You want to preserve that classical

925
00:49:02,782 --> 00:49:05,234
information, presumably. I'm not sure.

926
00:49:05,272 --> 00:49:08,262
I guess my question to everyone is, are

927
00:49:08,396 --> 00:49:15,526
object persistence in

928
00:49:15,548 --> 00:49:18,022
the topic of classicality, object

929
00:49:18,076 --> 00:49:19,510
persistence and boundaries,

930
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:24,582
are these basically completely dual

931
00:49:24,646 --> 00:49:26,620
pictures? That's my question.

932
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,810
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

933
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:35,294
And we also need object persistence to

934
00:49:35,332 --> 00:49:36,480
define space.

935
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:43,262
So this

936
00:49:43,316 --> 00:49:49,666
idea of object persistence is a

937
00:49:49,688 --> 00:49:52,980
very key idea that has to be dealt with.

938
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,034
And physics has largely ignored this

939
00:49:56,072 --> 00:50:00,182
idea, which is kind of objects are taken

940
00:50:00,236 --> 00:50:01,190
for granted.

941
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,620
But I think what Carl says in that 2019

942
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,728
free energy principle for a particular

943
00:50:12,814 --> 00:50:15,976
physics paper is fairly clear on this.

944
00:50:16,078 --> 00:50:19,352
He basically says the free energy

945
00:50:19,406 --> 00:50:23,320
principle tells systems to persist.

946
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,670
That's basically what a system has to do

947
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,876
by maintaining the integrity of its

948
00:50:30,898 --> 00:50:34,012
Markov blanket. I think that's very

949
00:50:34,066 --> 00:50:35,020
insightful.

950
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,960
If it doesn't, it's not.

951
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:44,070
Yeah, it's not a system anymore.

952
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,610
Well, as we somewhat

953
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:55,450
glide towards a local closure,

954
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:00,154
of course anyone is welcome to bring

955
00:51:00,192 --> 00:51:02,650
up any reflections.

956
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:08,558
And also, I'd love to hear about where

957
00:51:08,644 --> 00:51:12,990
we go from this now measured

958
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:17,438
outcome. How do we prepare

959
00:51:17,614 --> 00:51:19,902
individually at the Institute scale,

960
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:23,540
ecosystem scale, and what are we

961
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,820
going to do coming out of this?

962
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,080
Are we talking about that right now.

963
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,950
Or any thoughts? Yeah,

964
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,728
keep learning, bro. What do you

965
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:46,976
mean by the ecosystem scale? Like the

966
00:51:46,998 --> 00:51:49,104
active inference ecosystem and our own

967
00:51:49,142 --> 00:51:53,104
ecosystems going on our

968
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:55,936
own scale. I guess the only thing I can

969
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:59,788
comment on this is I echo the view that,

970
00:51:59,894 --> 00:52:02,544
or not view, or rather remark that Chris

971
00:52:02,592 --> 00:52:04,656
made in the lecture about quantum

972
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:08,064
biology as a field. It's in a nascent

973
00:52:08,112 --> 00:52:12,468
stage, right? Mean, I think, you know,

974
00:52:12,634 --> 00:52:14,564
there will be a non trivial interaction

975
00:52:14,612 --> 00:52:16,330
between the active inference community

976
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:20,440
and quantum biology. I'm making that

977
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,110
surmise right now.

978
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,776
So let's talk about quantum biology for

979
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:35,450
a second,

980
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,832
I'll open up the Pandora's box here.

981
00:52:39,886 --> 00:52:41,336
Let's think of it as a parable as

982
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:43,524
opposed, or maybe even fan fiction.

983
00:52:43,572 --> 00:52:45,356
Because Chris has shared so much with

984
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:47,710
us, I want to kind of build off of it.

985
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,412
If you will indulge me for a second,

986
00:52:50,466 --> 00:52:51,996
I'll read you a little story. Just hear

987
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:55,984
the story out. Quantum biology sounds

988
00:52:56,102 --> 00:52:58,352
like more than up or down without saying

989
00:52:58,406 --> 00:53:01,824
that it is more up or down as

990
00:53:01,862 --> 00:53:04,060
what information can be counterfactually

991
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,496
is looking at carrying capacity as in

992
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:09,776
quotes can be. And from that carrying

993
00:53:09,808 --> 00:53:11,924
capacity comes orientation. Things like

994
00:53:11,962 --> 00:53:14,676
direction and scale, things like the

995
00:53:14,698 --> 00:53:17,508
ability to plan appear to fit better in

996
00:53:17,514 --> 00:53:20,600
the orientation category relative

997
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,348
to the carrying capacity category,

998
00:53:23,444 --> 00:53:26,520
which is noncommunativity in action.

999
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,240
This is a big if we agree that

1000
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:34,524
orientation is to follow should

1001
00:53:34,562 --> 00:53:37,112
our recognizing of planning affordances

1002
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:40,104
follow as well. So from the session

1003
00:53:40,152 --> 00:53:42,504
slide, there was a quote. Living systems

1004
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,644
are genetic quantum systems that the FEP

1005
00:53:45,692 --> 00:53:47,792
has driven to a high level of

1006
00:53:47,846 --> 00:53:50,912
computational complexity. And here the

1007
00:53:50,966 --> 00:53:54,016
in quotes computation is baked in as

1008
00:53:54,038 --> 00:53:57,028
something planable with this as a

1009
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:59,124
reference frame. To make plans, we need

1010
00:53:59,162 --> 00:54:01,590
carrying capacity. Check.

1011
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:06,404
Agreed. But in order to learn where

1012
00:54:06,442 --> 00:54:08,052
does the carrying capacity plus

1013
00:54:08,106 --> 00:54:11,624
orientation relationship insist that we

1014
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:14,552
start with a received plan? This

1015
00:54:14,606 --> 00:54:16,392
perspective is compared to, say,

1016
00:54:16,446 --> 00:54:19,944
actively inferring our way to the

1017
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:22,620
plan falls out of carrying capacity.

1018
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,612
Just making this explicit, we can then

1019
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:28,264
ask should we first apply a received

1020
00:54:28,312 --> 00:54:35,624
plan or apply active inference that

1021
00:54:35,662 --> 00:54:38,908
helps clarify when the strategy is one

1022
00:54:38,994 --> 00:54:42,076
more based on exploitation versus a

1023
00:54:42,098 --> 00:54:45,356
strategy more based and biased to

1024
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:48,200
exploration. In summary, when did

1025
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:51,328
information delivery things like product

1026
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:55,136
or package packaging begin to

1027
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:57,468
Trump information carrying capacity,

1028
00:54:57,644 --> 00:54:59,136
which is essentially information

1029
00:54:59,238 --> 00:55:02,676
processing rather than we need this

1030
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:04,416
paired relationship, the carrying

1031
00:55:04,448 --> 00:55:07,316
capacity plus the orientation as a

1032
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:09,700
minimum of two so that we can compare,

1033
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,668
identify change and know change model

1034
00:55:13,754 --> 00:55:16,696
patterns, et cetera. This is another way

1035
00:55:16,718 --> 00:55:18,232
of asking when did subject matter

1036
00:55:18,286 --> 00:55:20,904
expertise come to be seen as more

1037
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,392
valuable than prediction matter

1038
00:55:22,446 --> 00:55:25,272
expertise? When it seems like we need

1039
00:55:25,326 --> 00:55:28,780
both capacities if we want independency.

1040
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,284
And here's the kicker. If not given time

1041
00:55:32,322 --> 00:55:34,316
to reflect on what's being asked here,

1042
00:55:34,338 --> 00:55:36,652
and I know Chris oftentimes has a nice

1043
00:55:36,706 --> 00:55:39,744
long pause to reflect. But if not given

1044
00:55:39,782 --> 00:55:42,064
the time to reflect, people will take

1045
00:55:42,102 --> 00:55:44,480
their subject matter expertise strategy,

1046
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,284
which clearly is a next move perspective

1047
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:50,592
over one that holds up next move plus

1048
00:55:50,646 --> 00:55:52,932
all moves, meaning that they bring

1049
00:55:52,986 --> 00:55:54,756
prediction matter expertise in to

1050
00:55:54,778 --> 00:55:58,832
follow, to parameterize, to unlock,

1051
00:55:58,976 --> 00:56:02,304
to unring, to unbound what's

1052
00:56:02,352 --> 00:56:05,592
in and what's out. Of course, without

1053
00:56:05,646 --> 00:56:08,344
prediction matter expertise, what is

1054
00:56:08,382 --> 00:56:09,560
quantum biology?

1055
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,524
Wow. Can you just post that someplace so

1056
00:56:16,562 --> 00:56:18,848
we can think about. I'll just email it

1057
00:56:18,854 --> 00:56:20,610
to you, Chris. Cool.

1058
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,530
That was great.

1059
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:34,360
Yeah. I think you're asking about the

1060
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:40,294
fundamental question of what does Carl

1061
00:56:40,342 --> 00:56:44,074
call it? Epistemic value and

1062
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:47,402
the role of curiosity and that whole

1063
00:56:47,456 --> 00:56:48,720
cluster of issues.

1064
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:53,774
Well, I think I need to give you the

1065
00:56:53,812 --> 00:56:55,726
credit that you deserve on this. I think

1066
00:56:55,748 --> 00:56:58,366
it's the fact that you have allowed us

1067
00:56:58,388 --> 00:57:01,822
to interact with you that's given us

1068
00:57:01,956 --> 00:57:04,866
that kind of courage and confidence to

1069
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:06,478
be able to put things out there. I don't

1070
00:57:06,494 --> 00:57:08,466
know how much of it sticks or how much

1071
00:57:08,488 --> 00:57:11,054
of it. I'm not sure that it requires

1072
00:57:11,102 --> 00:57:13,646
disciples, but I do think it provides.

1073
00:57:13,758 --> 00:57:16,102
What you've done is provided that

1074
00:57:16,156 --> 00:57:19,446
medium. So again, I guess that's my way

1075
00:57:19,468 --> 00:57:21,798
of saying thank you. Well, thank.

1076
00:57:21,964 --> 00:57:22,870
That's.

1077
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:30,306
Yeah. Thank you, Chris. I have learned

1078
00:57:30,338 --> 00:57:34,054
so much this year, more than ever

1079
00:57:34,092 --> 00:57:34,680
before.

1080
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,978
Okay, well, great. This has been a great

1081
00:57:43,144 --> 00:57:51,512
class, and hopefully

1082
00:57:51,576 --> 00:57:54,620
various things will come out of mean.

1083
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:56,284
Certainly just from looking at the

1084
00:57:56,322 --> 00:57:57,680
questions that have been in the question

1085
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:00,368
forum. Lots of people are thinking about

1086
00:58:00,454 --> 00:58:05,836
these issues, and that's

1087
00:58:05,868 --> 00:58:09,588
what I think AI needs going forward, is

1088
00:58:09,754 --> 00:58:12,070
people thinking and talking about stuff.

1089
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:17,686
Thank you, Chris. Yeah. A few outcomes

1090
00:58:17,718 --> 00:58:20,666
that we know will transcribe the

1091
00:58:20,688 --> 00:58:22,646
lectures, the discussions, add in

1092
00:58:22,688 --> 00:58:25,054
screenshots, add in the Q and A, and

1093
00:58:25,092 --> 00:58:28,000
publish those proceedings as a book.

1094
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:32,800
We will pick back up in 2024

1095
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:37,314
with potentially having the recorded

1096
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:40,802
and written contents as part

1097
00:58:40,856 --> 00:58:44,660
of a curriculum. So not just

1098
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:49,126
replicating, but now continuing on

1099
00:58:49,228 --> 00:58:52,454
with another quantum flow across this

1100
00:58:52,492 --> 00:58:56,066
now classical artifact, because it's

1101
00:58:56,098 --> 00:58:57,862
quantum in the moment, and then once

1102
00:58:57,916 --> 00:59:01,370
it's communicated, it becomes a classic.

1103
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,514
And we have months to prepare that

1104
00:59:03,552 --> 00:59:06,906
state. All right,

1105
00:59:07,008 --> 00:59:10,140
great. I'm going to have to sign off,

1106
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:13,086
but thank you very much. Thank you,

1107
00:59:13,108 --> 00:59:16,510
Chris. Thank you. Thank you, Chris.

1108
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:21,680
Ciao. Bye. Does anyone else,

1109
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:27,214
does anyone else want to make any

1110
00:59:27,332 --> 00:59:28,930
reflection or comment?

1111
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,974
I just thank everybody that's helped

1112
00:59:33,022 --> 00:59:36,066
organize, participated in all of the

1113
00:59:36,088 --> 00:59:38,126
discussions, even the people who showed

1114
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:40,142
up at the very end of the discussions,

1115
00:59:40,206 --> 00:59:41,954
because I really appreciate that.

1116
00:59:42,072 --> 00:59:44,566
Again, I cannot emphasize enough, when

1117
00:59:44,588 --> 00:59:46,246
we get a chance to interact with this

1118
00:59:46,268 --> 00:59:48,086
stuff, when we get to manipulate it,

1119
00:59:48,108 --> 00:59:50,146
when we're able to ask questions, even

1120
00:59:50,188 --> 00:59:53,194
though we feel vulnerable, I think that

1121
00:59:53,232 --> 00:59:54,794
that's when a lot of the really good

1122
00:59:54,832 --> 00:59:58,438
stuff tends to get consolidated.

1123
00:59:58,534 --> 01:00:00,380
So thank you to all of you.

1124
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:05,278
I'll read some fun comments from the

1125
01:00:05,284 --> 01:00:08,954
live chat, just the last several,

1126
01:00:09,002 --> 01:00:11,200
just to recognize some of our great

1127
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:17,390
colleagues. Lucrative leadership wrote,

1128
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:21,982
yes. More on affordances. Ian wrote,

1129
01:00:22,046 --> 01:00:23,746
would love for this series to continue.

1130
01:00:23,848 --> 01:00:25,426
Joanne wrote, thank you. This was a

1131
01:00:25,448 --> 01:00:28,402
wonderful learning experience. Mills 81

1132
01:00:28,456 --> 01:00:31,240
Two wrote the probable and the possible.

1133
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:33,958
There are some emojis. Pablo sent a

1134
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:37,254
heart pow wow dao. I don't speak

1135
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:39,478
this language, but I can definitely

1136
01:00:39,564 --> 01:00:42,554
hear, understand, and feel it. So thank

1137
01:00:42,592 --> 01:00:44,202
you, everybody who's watching along.

1138
01:00:44,256 --> 01:00:49,674
These were all great, and we

1139
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:51,994
prepare and measure every day at the

1140
01:00:52,032 --> 01:00:54,302
institute. So I really do hope that

1141
01:00:54,356 --> 01:00:56,718
people from all backgrounds, all

1142
01:00:56,804 --> 01:00:59,950
vectors, all preference and prior sets

1143
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:03,914
come engage and not presuppose

1144
01:01:03,962 --> 01:01:07,922
too much about us or themselves

1145
01:01:08,056 --> 01:01:10,210
or what can happen when we really do

1146
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,394
interact and when we take it into the

1147
01:01:15,432 --> 01:01:17,506
kinds of spaces and timelines that we

1148
01:01:17,528 --> 01:01:18,900
know we want to be on.

1149
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:25,170
All right, thank you. Bye.

1150
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,754
Thank you, everyone.
