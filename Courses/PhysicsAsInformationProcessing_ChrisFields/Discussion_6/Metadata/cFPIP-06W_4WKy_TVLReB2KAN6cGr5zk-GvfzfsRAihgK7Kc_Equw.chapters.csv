2940	191450	00:02	If you're watching live, please feel free to write any questions or comments in the live chat. Overall, this has been a great series. We all learned a lot. Thanks to active Inference Institute for facilitating this.	This is our last Physics As Information Processing discussion. It's October 28, 2023	Post-Part 6: Physics as Information Processing
191600	250202	03:11	In school, I was trying to use free energy to develop some sort of a network of agents. Now I'm just kind of opening up to things and participating more in the world that I exist in. This is a natural.	David, what brought you into the game in the bottom of 9th	In the Elevator With David
250346	503630	04:10	Dean Obeidallah: I'm still confused about like Markov Blanket and non localism. It seems to be highly local, and it seems like everything is connected with everything. Can I just clarification? Andrew and Chris will hopefully join, too.	Dean: I'm confused about Markov Blanket and non localism	Markov Blanket and Non-Localism
504160	551770	08:24	Chris and Ander David asked about the Markov blanket and about if how everything is connected to everything. Do you want to give any quick thoughts on this, or are you asking. Me? Either of you could.	Chris and Ander David asked about the Markov blanket	Markov Blanket and the Holographic Screen
558420	614530	09:18	Markov Blanket, we can pivot it to, I'm sure. Know, the cycle of error correction, memory and so on. Those would be my only two comments in the agenda for today. Maybe Chris can say a few words, but I didn't mean to interrupt.	Question. We just began and started with a Markov blanket question	Markov and the cycle of error correction
614900	951530	10:14	David Wheeler: Question was if everything is mutually connected and mutually defined and interconnected. He says if you're inside a holographic screen, you can't know that you're not entangled with whatever's outside. Wheeler: The answer has to do with whose point of view we're talking about.	Question was if everything is mutually connected and mutually defined and interconnected	John Feist on the Markov Blanket
953870	1044550	15:53	For a system with that kind of a base graph, there aren't Markov blankets. In fact, the Bayesian Graph describes the factorization, or the articulation and the sparsity of the system. But that's not to say that differences can't make a difference at a distance.	David: In a fully connected setting, there aren't Markov blankets	Bayesian Networks: Everything Connected to Everything
1046190	1208760	17:26	Einsteinian gravity is infinite range, but it's locally encoded. So the Einsteinian gravity that you feel is your local measurement of the curvature of your local bit of Spacetime. As soon as something changes anywhere in the universe, it affects you. Non locality was anathema to Einstein.	What about the non zero gravitational effect of something distant in space and time	John Feith on Einsteinian Gravity
1211470	2025990	20:11	Daniel: Is it fair to say that life, as it grows, gets more of those degrees of freedom, but then somehow anything that happens to Spacetime is an illusion? Do the growth of Spacetime amount to loss in error correction capacity? And maybe more speculatively, how you reconcile this with loss of thermodynamics?	Daniel Blank: I'm fascinated by how life's degrees of freedom grow	Does Life Dominate the Dimensions of Spacetime?
2030800	2344370	33:50	David: From what I understand, Bohr and Einstein had opposing views on breaking down the interconnectedness into separate constituent subsystems. Would it be fair to reformulate your question as saying, are blankets objective or not?	Daniel: Bohr and Einstein had opposing views on interconnectedness	The Blanket Screen Relationality Debate
2346980	2587290	39:06	Gene Wigner talks about consciousness being an essential concept in quantum theory. He describes his friend's entangled state in a thought experiment. People were quite honestly mystified with what observation actually is and what consciousness is. There's some sort of mystery cell division of self reference.	Gene Wigner's famous thought experiment explores self reference in quantum theory	The Wigner's Friend Thought Experiment
2588460	2899190	43:08	Chris: Is the copy and diversify feature a necessity of having to run this cycle? Daniel: I don't know whether it's necessary. The environmental interaction is constantly at risk of spinning out of control. And it's that degradation that I think is driving this need for constant copying.	Daniel: I have two questions about error correction and memory in organisms	Daniel Feuerstein
2903930	3044070	48:23	Two things associated to classicality are object persistence and boundaries. Are these basically completely dual pictures? And we also need object persistence to define space.	Object persistence and boundaries have a lot to do with classicality	Exploring Classicality and Object persistence
3047210	3142110	50:47	There will be a non trivial interaction between the active inference community and quantum biology. How do we prepare individually at the Institute scale, ecosystem scale, and what are we going to do coming out of this?	I'd love to hear about where we go from this now measured outcome	In the Light of Quantum Inference
3152460	3559630	52:32	So let's talk about quantum biology for a second. When did subject matter expertise come to be seen as more valuable than prediction matter expertise? This has been a great class, and hopefully various things will come out of mean.	To make plans, we need carrying capacity and orientation	A Lesson on Quantum Biology
3560370	3687730	59:20	I just thank everybody that's helped organize, participated in all of the discussions. I think that that's when a lot of the really good stuff tends to get consolidated. I'll read some fun comments from the live chat, just the last several. Thank you, everyone. Bye.	I just want to thank everybody who participated in this live chat	A Celebration of the Presentation
