2940	3490	1	A	0.64	00:02	1	You.
7700	36276	2	B	0.96841	00:07	54	Hello and welcome, everybody. This is physics as information processing. It's October 28, 2023, and we're in discussion six, so we'll see where and how and when we go. But to begin with, thank you for watching. If you're watching live, please feel free to write any questions or comments in the live chat.
36388	78490	3	B	0.99998	00:36	85	As this is our last discussion, we're going to be probably ranging broadly, so looking forward to people's comments there. Otherwise, perhaps we can all go around first and say hello or just give any thoughts or reflections to get things going. And then we'll jump into some of the questions and answers and look at some of these great thoughts that have been sent and responded to. So perhaps Dean and then Harrison. David, any just overall thoughts or comments to get us going?
80060	120196	4	C	0.99981	01:20	95	Thanks. Daniel. I guess my overall impression was that I think that the way that the entire series was organized and structured allowed for these kinds of conversations that we're having today, which I think are really valuable. As you can see on the slide here, I think a lot of question and answer tends to be focused around what is, whereas the conversations that we've had, we can sort of tease that apart a little bit and ask questions around what if? And get into the counterfactual piece of it and interact around that.
120218	133800	5	C	0.99	02:00	36	And I've really, really appreciated that. So that's my overall sense that we haven't left it sort of on the page. We've actually been able to sort of breathe some life into it through these conversations.
138270	170226	6	B	0.83268	02:18	58	Cool. Haris? Yeah, I just wanted to say that it was a great series. We all learned a lot, and we got the opportunity to even ask questions to Chris and get back some very insightful answers that they are very helpful in order to, let's say, push the envelope forward. Overall, this has been a great series.
170338	189466	7	D	0.9971	02:50	37	I've enjoyed it a lot. And while conversing with some of my colleagues, they also enjoyed it. So the feedback is great. And thanks to active Inference Institute for facilitating this, and to you guys. Thank you.
189568	198190	8	B	0.99952	03:09	27	ThanK you and welcome. David, if you want to just begin with, any thoughts or what brought you into the game in the bottom of the 9th?
202050	228920	9	A	0.99972	03:22	61	Well, in school, I was actually trying to use free energy to develop some sort of a network of agents that were deciding what information to send and what states to be in based on each other's approximation of each other's states. So I registered at the beginning, but then I guess life happened and I didn't really cross the page.
233630	248254	10	A	1.0	03:53	57	Now I'm just kind of opening up to things and participating more in the world that I exist in. And this is a natural. This is really tied to the work that I was doing in school. I don't know if this is a place to ask a question, so I'm. Not going to ask any questions.
248292	259410	11	A	0.70747	04:08	26	But that's like the urgent. Let's begin with that. Okay. Yeah, so I was thinking about. I'm still confused about like Markov Blanket and non localism.
263430	297662	12	A	0.70927	04:23	81	How would those two. What about work together? Well, like, non localism, seems to me that an entity could be distributed arbitrarily in whatever is. I don't know if the universe is like Spacetime is what is, or if that's just a construction that we create through the information processing and putting relation, enunciating or rendering the information in a way where it's like all the related components can be mutually distinguished. But the Markov blanket seems to be highly local.
297796	327480	13	A	0.5	04:57	61	I don't know, maybe this is what, like, I'm confused about this. It seems to be highly local, and it seems like everything is connected with everything. So I'm kind of confused about how an entity could be defined with a Markov blanket while at the same time what seems to be completely intertwined. Non local, mutually defined. Yes, Dean, please.
328090	340970	14	C	0.98425	05:28	21	So can I just. David, just clarification. Are you thinking that local and non local is somehow similar to maybe arbitrary?
346240	380180	15	A	0.98124	05:46	85	I'm thinking local is within a volume and non local is distributed like a sphere, like a small sphere, where all the information is within a sphere and everything within that sphere is causally relevant and Everything without is causally irrelevant. But then I'm thinking of a Markov blanket as a sphere and everything on the inside is like independent statistically from everything on the outside. I guess I'm asking around, where do you see that being placed? Do you see that being placed arbitrarily?
384610	399940	16	C	0.9064	06:24	30	When you set that up, whenever you decide where that boundary exists, are you asking because it's local or it's non local because it's wherever inside and outside is present?
404710	421320	17	C	0.99107	06:44	43	Is the. What's the word I'm looking for? Are you wondering about how that doesn't seem to be consistent, that 1 minute it can be here and then the next minute it can change and arbitrarily end up being in a different place?
431160	454670	18	A	0.76	07:11	56	It doesn't seem to me that that's the confusion. It's more like, you know, David Bohm's implicate and explicated order and the idea that the explicated order is like one hologram. There's like the hollow movement where each layer affects each layer and the explicated is all at once explicate order, mutual relatedness. I don't know.
457440	489060	19	A	1.0	07:37	78	I don't know if these words are incoherent completely, like, and then, but then the Markov blanket, like, I'm I'm taking the example of my skin. I don't know if that's even good example, but my skin is like a Markov blanket. But then if everything is mutually related and explicated order, this whole body is submerged in the same field that everything else is submerged in. And in that sense, everything is linked to everything. There's no.
489130	490630	20	A	1.0	08:09	4	I don't know. Like.
495500	509390	21	B	0.76224	08:15	22	Let me try adding a few pieces. So welcome. Andrew and Chris will hopefully join, too. Here we go. Okay, opening act.
511440	541720	22	B	0.52154	08:31	63	Just to catch up, Chris and Ander David asked about the Markov blanket and about if how everything is connected to everything and how we associate Markov Blanket or the holographic screen with localism and non locality. Do you want to give any quick thoughts on this, or are you asking. Me if you want to? Either of you could. I don't know.
541870	551770	23	E	0.98519	09:01	20	Let's wait a minute for Chris to show up. Yeah, I'm here now. Yeah, I'm glad you found the way.
558420	590504	24	E	0.8068	09:18	69	Question. Did you guys go through the slides of last time, the lecture on. No, no. We just began and started with a Markov blanket question. Yeah, I think you wouldn't hurt to talk about that, because a big part of that last lecture was the copy and diversify notion as a universal feature in mean, naively, I think know the creation of new boundaries is implicit in there.
590542	614530	25	E	0.97738	09:50	62	So maybe Chris can comment, but I also thought it was very worthy of mentioning today. Know, the cycle of error correction, memory and so on. So those would be my only two comments in the agenda for today. Maybe Chris can say a few words, but I didn't mean to interrupt. So, Markov Blanket, we can pivot it to, I'm sure.
614900	632710	26	F	0.4443	10:14	41	Okay, I think I'm seeing this question. Is this a question about the definition of Markov Blanket? There's something about I can't actually see the entire. No, it's not a question on my screen. Oh, it's not a question on your.
634060	659804	27	B	0.99364	10:34	53	Question on your screen. Right. But could you tell me what the question is again? Yeah, David, just restate it how you see it. Well, the question was if everything is mutually connected and mutually defined and interconnected, and there's non localism in the sense that everything is mutually connected and mutually defined.
659932	672710	28	A	1.0	10:59	29	And I'm kind of implicitly working with the assumption that the implicit explicit order makes sense. And the explicit is, like one hologram. And it's lost audio altogether now.
675320	679880	29	B	0.83	11:15	9	Oh, I still hear him. Oh, the audio. Chris?
684730	691400	30	E	0.99402	11:24	13	Chris. Yeah, I lost at least half of that audio. Just dropped out.
694330	717520	31	A	0.77493	11:34	61	Try to. Sorry about that. If everything is kind of explicated, like, if it's information in the brain is kind of rendering it all at once together, I'm just confused. And the whole body is submerged the whole body is submerged in it. If I look in the mirror, the whole body is submerged in it, and it's all non local.
718130	745778	32	A	0.99998	11:58	82	By that, I mean it's all connected together and mutually defined and mutually necessary to even make sense of any piece of it, if there is even such a thing as a piece. And I'm wondering. So thaT's one way of looking at it. And then the other way is, like, the local to me, it seems like there's, like, the skin Markov blanket, and it's kind of local. And I'm kind of confused as to how those things kind of worked.
745884	747420	33	A	0.40986	12:25	4	Like, how those things.
750350	770820	34	A	1.0	12:30	65	It seems like all the information in a sphere, a sphere could be a Markov blanket. And then on the inside and the outside, they're statistically independent, is that the whole movement on the inside and the outside, because of the Markov blanket, separates those. But then if this whole body is submerged in this thing that's mutually related. I'm just confused as to how.
774630	777780	35	A	0.66	12:54	12	I don't know. I'm confused as to how those things work together.
783370	799290	36	F	0.77699	13:03	38	I'm not sure I understand your question, but I suspect the answer has to do with whose point of view we're talking about. So, if you are the system that's in. So let's fix a Markov blanket someplace.
801630	819600	37	F	0.99985	13:21	44	If you're the system on the inside, then all you can see is what's encoded on the blanket, and you have no independent access to what the dynamic says on the outside. So you don't actually know what the dynamics is on the outside.
821830	879860	38	F	0.72	13:41	107	And similarly, if you're on the outside now, if you're somehow able to view the whole system, you can see the whole system as having some joint dynamics. But if the whole system is isolated, then there isn't anybody on the outside, kind of by definition. So the idea of a whole dynamics is just a theoretical postulate that we make to make the mathematics make sense. Now, if you move to from the classical formulation to the quantum formulation, then it's possible to prove a very nice theorem, which is that if you're inside a holographic screen, you can't measure the entanglement entropy across the screen.
881910	936790	39	F	0.9992	14:41	105	What that means is that you can't know that your state is conditionally independent of what's going on outside. So if you're inside a holographic screen, you can't know that you're not entangled with whatever's outside. So you can't even know whether you have a well defined state in a sense. And sort of, I think the same thing would probably hold true from the point of view inside a Markov blanket, that you wouldn't be able to know whether your Markov blanket had holes in it or something like that. The problem is, in the classical formulation, you assume there's no analog of entanglement.
937530	951530	40	F	0.99738	15:37	40	So there's no analog of entanglement entropy. So I think the strongest thing you can say is you don't actually know your statistical relationship to what's going on outside, but you still can only see what's encoded on the blanket.
953870	979426	41	B	0.99962	15:53	67	Thank you, Chris. If I could add a few more pieces. So, David, you described everything connected to everything. For a system with that kind of a base graph, there aren't Markov blankets, because a Markov blanket is the set of nodes that make two other sets of nodes conditionally independent. So in a fully connected setting, again leading to the question, what is outside of that?
979448	1011690	42	B	0.99949	16:19	70	But in a fully connected setting, you don't have a blanket as such. In fact, the Bayesian Graph describes the factorization, or the articulation and the sparsity of the system. So it is a connectedness that is usually much, much sparser than everything connected to everything. But that's not to say that differences can't make a difference at a distance. It's just that they propagate through a local causal structure.
1011850	1058240	43	B	1.0	16:51	81	And then Spacetime is constructed by certain kinds of cognitive agents. That was one of the key aspects of this course. And so we can take as primary the topology of the active inference agent environment relation. And then Markov Blanket is just the sensorium on the inbound and the action capacity on the outbound. One question, though, I do have to that is, what about the non zero gravitational effect, for example, of something that's distant in space and time?
1060130	1074370	44	B	1.0	17:40	29	Of course, Markov Blanket don't have to be spatial temporal. They can be in arbitrary state spaces. But how do we deal with those kinds of long range influences?
1079010	1122650	45	A	0.9994	17:59	55	That's my question. Yeah. Well, here I think it's useful to contrast Newtonian gravity with Einsteinian gravity. Newtonian gravity is infinite range and instantaneously acting, whereas Einsteinian gravity is infinite range, but it's locally encoded. So the Einsteinian gravity that you feel is your local measurement of the curvature of your local bit of Spacetime.
1123570	1148500	46	F	0.99725	18:43	48	So that is very much happening on your Markov blanket, right? It's a local measurement, local in Spacetime. So let's assume there's a Spacetime that's objective and characterizes everything, then you're locally measuring it on your blanket, and that's what you feel as gravitational attraction or your mass.
1150630	1199010	47	F	0.97916	19:10	97	Whereas in Newtonian or Laplacian gravity, you don't have that sense of locality, right. As soon as something changes anywhere in the universe, it affects you. So Einstein was struggling, of course, to make gravity consistent with electromagnetism, where it was clear that forces are transmitted at finite speed, the speed of light. And he didn't have the idea of a graviton moving at the speed of light, but he did have this idea of local measurement. So non locality was anathema to Einstein, and that's basically why he spent so much trouble removing it from physics.
1199690	1208760	48	F	0.99	19:59	29	And that's why he hated the idea of entanglement so much, because it seemed to him that from a Spacetime point of view, it had to be non local.
1211470	1254646	49	E	0.62711	20:11	100	Daniel, can I bring up a point at this point? So I think this is somewhat relevant to a question I really wanted to ask Chris, which is in lecture six. I remember minute 23. I wish I had written it down, but I can roughly remember there was that phylogenetic graph, and you see life growing in a self similar way, just like the genealogical tree of species, same thing happens at the individual level with growth and so on. Anyways, I found that fascinated in the sense that the degrees of freedom, of life as a whole grow.
1254748	1275434	50	E	0.99993	20:54	47	Right. And around that minute 23, you made a comment, well, then the environment must be shrinking. And you tie this with Spacetime. And something about Spacetime from the physics side, we also have that we have cosmological inflation and Whatnot. Are any of those things related?
1275562	1311834	51	E	0.99988	21:15	95	That remark, I feel like, was made in passing, and I think there's a lot there to be said. It also maybe shed some light on the emergent Spacetime issue. If it does emerge from a more basic ontological object, like the Tensor network and the degrees of freedom in the tensor network, is it fair to say that life, as it grows, gets more of those degrees of freedom, but then somehow anything that happens to Spacetime is an illusion? In that sense, I don't even know if I'm familiar in that question. Right.
1311872	1360940	52	E	0.96573	21:51	83	But I think Chris knows what I'm talking about. Yeah, the comment makes the most sense in the context of the state space itself, leaving aside Spacetime. So if you think of a Hilbert space and draw a boundary someplace that separates what we're going to call life from what we're going to call non life. And essentially, what life has done over the past 3 billion years is incorporate bits of the non life part of the state space into life. Right?
1362430	1379040	53	F	0.99998	22:42	31	Total biomass is increasing, so more and more of the available mass is getting incorporated into living things. And so if we can kind of heuristically fold Spacetime in and say.
1383890	1417500	54	C	0.9	23:03	67	You. Know, in the, in the, in the locality, in the locale of Earth, and over this fairly short time period, the expansion of Spacetime is more or less negligible. So life is actually taking up more space now than it did certainly at the time of LUCA, when all of us weren't around. But there is just one probably population of cells that we're descendants of.
1420750	1439380	55	F	0.98333	23:40	43	But the point about the Hilbert space is just the point that if you've divided it in two and you move the boundary, then one system gets bigger at the expense of the other system, which now has less of the Hilbert space.
1441830	1470540	56	F	0.99819	24:01	57	So that's all that remark really is, right? As the system, in a sense, takes over degrees of freedom of the. That's. In that case, it becomes a different system at every time step from the point of view of it has now a different Hilbert space and different internal dynamics. So physically it's a different thing.
1471230	1517290	57	F	0.92891	24:31	107	But when we look at it, we say, oh, this thing is continuous through time. It is expanding, it's growing, it's developing, evolving, whatever. Right? So then, I guess, comment, just a question that just occurred as you were talking, that begs the question, does that biomass come to dominate all the degrees of freedom in the universe? Is that presumably there's a tension with the rate at which those degrees of freedom are growing and the rate at which Spacetime is growing, does the growth of Spacetime, in terms of those degrees of freedom that may be more fundamental, amount to loss in error correction capacity?
1521070	1535970	58	E	0.65	25:21	33	And maybe more speculatively, how you reconcile this with loss of thermodynamics. Are you implying that life is going to come to dominate everything and fill up the entirety of the known universe?
1538630	1608040	59	F	0.99994	25:38	94	Yeah, I think that's a stretch. But I would say at this point that until we have a mature theory of quantum gravity that makes enough empirical predictions to be testable. It's not clear, at least to me, how the whole emergent Spacetime picture fits together with the inflationary picture or the expanding Spacetime picture, in some sense, taking a strict Hilbert space view. If the universe is an isolated system, then its Hilbert space is fixed. And so your question, in a sense, becomes, what's the relationship between Spacetime and this silver space?
1608890	1624960	60	F	0.73107	26:48	36	Are what we think of as Spacetime degrees of freedom, real degrees of freedom, or not? And seems to me that question really isn't resolved, and I'm not sure at this point how to resolve it.
1633410	1680000	61	D	0.76615	27:13	82	HArris yeah, just have something small to add. Overall, this is very interesting, and these questions are very deep. What I wanted to add is that I was thinking the initial question regarding Markov Blanket, and I also have some question that it's related with it. But I will ask Chris later. What I wanted to add now is that basically, Markov Blanket are a way of describing the boundaries of a system in terms of statistical mechanics or statistics, let's say.
1680370	1741890	62	D	1.0	28:00	105	And essentially, from what I understand, they are paramount in order to define observers and also the systems under observation. So any physical system that can be seen as an observer with a Markov blanket, let's say, so now, trying to tie it all up with active inference. Well, active inference, as I understand it, it implies that the system is actively referring to its external states from its internal states in an effort to both learn, let's say, and adapt to the environment. So this goes back and ties with this metaphorical link, let's say, with the skin. This is how I understand it.
1742040	1768460	63	D	0.99	29:02	63	And it actually means that a system with a Markov blanket can actually be seen as performing physics as information processing, which is the back of this series that Haris is offering to us. And a final comment. In terms of non locality. Non locality can actually be seen as a form of information processing. So this is what I wanted to add.
1776160	1785230	64	F	0.93802	29:36	19	Did you say how non locality is a form of information processing? Yes, this is how I understand it.
1789930	1792950	65	D	0.99297	29:49	7	What do you think about that, Chris?
1800320	1878820	66	F	0.99802	30:00	85	If we put it in terms of entanglement, entanglement is a useful resource for information processing, but it's only a usable resource if it's combined with classical communication, either across time or across space. So entanglement is only useful as a resource if different observers can act locally, I. E. Without interfering with each other on the quantum resource. So if you think of entanglement as non locality, if you embed it in Spacetime in that way, then it is useful as a computational resource.
1879880	1925300	67	F	0.63939	31:19	76	But the observers also have to transmit classical communications in a way that fully complies with locality. So in a Bell EPR type experiment. For example, if you have Alice in one lab and Bob in the other lab making measurements of some entangled state, then at some point to know that the state is entangled, they have to send their classical records to each other as classical communication and then deal with those records locally.
1927320	1937800	68	F	0.99994	32:07	22	So in a sense, non locality in that sense is useful for computation, but it's only useful if you also have locality.
1940620	1950670	69	D	0.99926	32:20	12	Great. Thank you. Actually, I'm working on a novel notion. Let's say.
1953440	1978900	70	D	0.99997	32:33	43	That is something like, takes the notion of entanglement and transform it in the following sense. I'm actually thinking of maximum tacklement as a resource for classical computation. So that's something I am actually exploring. I find it to be a nice concept.
1981180	1988632	71	F	0.99849	33:01	13	Did you say maximum unentanglement? Yes. Maximum separability? Yeah. Okay, that makes sense.
1988686	1991000	72	F	1.0	33:08	6	I mean, we need maximum separability.
1993680	2021250	73	F	0.99927	33:13	58	We need to be able to factor a state space to talk about two different observers. So to talk about conditional independence. Yeah. In my head, this maximum entanglement as a resource can actually be expended to perform classical computation or even to increase the coherence of a quantum system. So I'm playing with that notion a bit.
2025000	2025990	74	C	0.99973	33:45	2	Thank you.
2030800	2063850	75	A	0.99965	33:50	58	Can I ask one thing really quick about. Yeah, okay. So apparently, from what I don't understand very much, but from Bohr, apparently. The. Whole experimental setup was one entity that couldn't be broken down into constituent pieces that are interacting, but had to be taken as one entity, from what I understand, and apparently Einstein's view was.
2065340	2084460	76	A	0.95751	34:25	58	Well, I really don't know what his view was, but apparently it's not one entity. It can be broken down into localized pieces that are interacting. And apparently they couldn't get along. Like Warren Einstein. Apparently there was like a party or something, and then they all congregate to separate parts of the room and didn't really interact.
2085220	2108070	77	A	1.0	34:45	59	And apparently it was because they had these opposing views on the same thing of breaking down the interconnectedness into separate constituent subsystems. And even like taking the partial trace, there was one universal function taking the partial trace, which Puzzley defined the subsystems. Whenever perfectly, it's all tied together. But I can't really explicit. I'm trying to say.
2112120	2112870	78	A	0.66827	35:12	1	Everyone.
2115820	2153220	79	A	0.99685	35:15	91	These seem like two very opposed view. They seem like very alternative views. Like on one side you have kind of like an indivisible whole. On the other side you have locality where it's almost like there's like a sequence of measurements leading up to an ego, an eye that then measures as like a real entity, as another one is like the observer and the observed are one thing, they cannot be meaningfully separated. Maybe functionally they can be separated, but as actually existing subcomponents, they cannot be defined strictly.
2154600	2186290	80	A	1.0	35:54	98	From what I understand. One of them is saying, yes, you can define these subsystems and they really do exist as separate entities. The other one is saying, that's just kind of like a useful way to organize information as to operate on that information, deposit a subject and an object, and to have the subject operate on the object is a useful way for thinking to separate itself. And it seems like this is closer to Bohr than the other one is closer. Well, apparently that's a distinction of, like, Boer and Einstein, from what I understand.
2186820	2215492	81	A	0.99981	36:26	57	From what I understand, which is, please correct me if it's. Yeah, I just wanted to put that out there. And I don't know what that's going to spawn in terms of responses, but yes. Well, I think that's a fair characterization of the Bohr Einstein debate, actually, to. Add a response there, whether it actually exists.
2215636	2271432	82	B	1.0	36:55	120	It seems like in one of those framings, you had an observer looking at something, and if we define actually existing in a relational observed setting, then to the observer the measurement actually exists. Prepare, measure, prepare, measure. And then from another perspective, viewing that setup, then it's the observer of a setup. And so it's just, again, to Chris's first point about what perspective, and this is one of the most essential pieces that the blanket screen relationality brings into play, is there isn't a view from nowhere, but there is a perspective that may have a definite answer, and yet there are multiple perspectives that have complementary answers in our scenario. Daniel, can I speak for a minute?
2271486	2280840	83	B	0.76	37:51	30	Oh, yeah. I was muted earlier. I didn't realize. I meant to ask. David, I don't have an answer to your question, but I was wondering if you could reformulate.
2281000	2319464	84	E	0.98467	38:01	101	Would it be fair to reformulate your question as saying, are blankets objective or not? Is the Bohr Einstein debate equivalent to that? And then second, and I guess this may be for Chris, I was skimming through the answers, and one of them was talking about how one of the big tensions between general relativity and quantum theory is the idea of object persistence. And I don't know how to articulate it either, but I feel like it was more or less what you were getting at, David, is that correct? Yeah, I think that's another way to put it.
2319582	2338990	85	A	1.0	38:39	56	And also the thing you said about the third person looking at those systems, if there's multi agent communication, that's kind of the thing that I'm kind of stuck on in terms of trying to understand this. Because if there's a third agent looking okay, those two are subsumed in the information on the holographic screen.
2342020	2344370	86	A	1.0	39:02	10	I don't know. Anyways, so that's where I'm kind of.
2346980	2360070	87	F	1.0	39:06	25	I think a delightful thing to read here is Gene Wigner's paper where he introduces the Wigner's friend thought experiment. And I think it's from.
2362860	2370170	88	F	0.95352	39:22	14	There's a book called the Scientist Speculates. The editor is someone named Good, good.
2374860	2407300	89	F	0.43	39:34	53	And Wigner has a paper in this book. I think it's 1961. And it's also the paper where Wigner talks about consciousness being an essential concept in quantum theory. But the thought experiment is that Wigner's friend is doing an experiment in his laboratory and making observations. And Wigner is outside the laboratory.
2408200	2445070	90	F	0.94	40:08	59	And Wigner has to regard his friend as in some sort of superposition with his instrument. He has to regard his friend as entangled with his friend's instruments. Until Vignner can actually interact locally with the friend. And make a measurement of the friend's state. And so it makes Wigner's friend and his apparatus look like an entangled pair.
2445570	2452370	91	F	0.99	40:45	17	And Wigner now looks like an experimenter who's operating on just one part of an entangled pair.
2454550	2480250	92	F	0.99624	40:54	44	But Wigner himself tells the story very nicely. And that sort of historical text, I think, is always useful to have a look at and see how the people themselves were responding to this idea. And Wigner is quite perplexed by this thought experiment.
2484110	2508130	93	F	0.63	41:24	42	And I think all of those people, they were quite honestly mystified with what observation actually is and what consciousness is. And all of these other questions that people are a little bit scared to talk about in the ensuing several decades.
2513700	2515040	94	A	0.99422	41:53	2	Self reference.
2517480	2532200	95	E	0.99753	41:57	30	Yeah, you can go ahead. Self reference seems to be like there's this ancient symbol of the uroboros. The output is the input. It feeds on itself. Even like consciousness.
2534220	2549260	96	A	1.0	42:14	46	I have to contextualize, to contextualize, like it's self referential. Everything refers to itself. And then at the end, self reference is where all the paradoxes are like, this sentence is false. Or all I know is that I know nothing. These are all paradoxical statements.
2550800	2559170	97	A	0.99997	42:30	22	So there's some sort of mystery cell division of self reference. That ancient view is that it's like embryogenesis, cosmogenesis, same thing.
2562900	2573510	98	A	1.0	42:42	37	I don't know. It seems to me that there's some sort of mystery that's so. It's like the mind. It just eludes I don't know. Thinking tries to make these thought systems, but it just slips out.
2574680	2592924	99	A	0.26	42:54	60	I can't grasp it. I don't mean, but that's already a conclusion, which I don't necessarily want to even make, because if it's self referenced, that is thinking, OK, then maybe it goes all the way to the bottom. But I don't know. Daniel, can I ask you a question before we run out of time? Actually, I have two.
2592962	2636810	100	E	0.99574	43:12	101	Maybe one is a bit longer. The second one. So the first one, Chris, I was very intrigued and looking forward to hear you talk a little bit about that cycle of error correction and memory and persistence and so on. And in particular, I was wondering if it relates at all to the main other thing you talked about in that lecture, six, the copy and diversify business. Because intuitively, if that cycle is something that an organism has to implement, I'm talking about that slide with the error correction and whatnot, then it pays the thermodynamic price for it.
2637260	2661970	101	E	0.86023	43:57	52	So presumably there is an anabolic process of trying to grow so you can feed degrees of freedom into this error correcting scheme, thinking like a physicist. Something like that might be happening. So is the copy and diversify feature a necessity of having to run this cycle? That's my first question.
2677450	2680390	102	F	0.84339	44:37	10	That's a good question. I don't know whether it's necessary.
2687720	2706380	103	F	1.0	44:47	32	I think one could think of a fairly small scale heat engine or metabolic system that can pull just enough free energy out of its environment to store a one bit memory.
2711040	2740870	104	F	1.0	45:11	55	And you can think of something like a flip flop, right? These things aren't alive. So it's not quite as complex as an organism, but it is using energy to maintain a memory, and its memory does influence its behavior. So I think we have these limiting cases like this that don't have to grow.
2743820	2778530	105	F	0.99966	45:43	37	But when you think about organisms, organisms have the problem of being made out of very delicate parts that need to be replaced. And it's that degradation that I think is driving this need for constant copying.
2785200	2835910	106	F	1.0	46:25	74	And from a physics point of view, I think what that boils down to is that the organisms living right at the edge of an interaction with its environment that's too strong to maintain. So the environmental interaction is constantly at risk of spinning out of control and having too large an energy transfer, which basically tears the Markov blanket apart and exposes too many of the internal degrees of freedom to the outside.
2839500	2869380	107	F	0.89525	47:19	57	So this may be one way of saying what characterizes life, that it's interacting with its environment right on the edge of an interaction that's too strong. And it's great to have a strong interaction because then you have big eigenvalues and so you have large bandwidth, but the risk is that the environment tears you apart.
2876610	2899190	108	B	0.99997	47:56	36	Close to the fire, but don't get burnt. Become the fire and then control the redox balance and gain that autopoietic regulative capacity, which works when it works. Yeah. Until something comes along with bigger teeth.
2903930	2944050	109	E	0.99998	48:23	82	Another comment, if I may, is, as the course comes to an end, two things I realized associated to classicality that we've talked a lot about in this class are object persistence and boundaries. Right? So classicality being a feature, intrinsically boundary related, and having a lot to do with object persistence. So artists just think completely dual from an FEP point of view, because you want to maintain the integrity of the boundary. You want to preserve that classical information, presumably.
2944550	2966620	110	E	0.88695	49:04	31	I'm not sure. I guess my question to everyone is, are object persistence in the topic of classicality, object persistence and boundaries, are these basically completely dual pictures? That's my question.
2968910	2970810	111	F	0.98136	49:28	5	Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
2972930	2976480	112	F	0.68	49:32	9	And we also need object persistence to define space.
2978770	3001190	113	F	0.99949	49:38	33	So this idea of object persistence is a very key idea that has to be dealt with. And physics has largely ignored this idea, which is kind of objects are taken for granted.
3005880	3035020	114	F	0.68749	50:05	54	But I think what Carl says in that 2019 free energy principle for a particular physics paper is fairly clear on this. He basically says the free energy principle tells systems to persist. That's basically what a system has to do by maintaining the integrity of its Markov blanket. I think that's very insightful.
3037610	3044070	115	B	0.50324	50:37	11	If it doesn't, it's not. Yeah, it's not a system anymore.
3047210	3086820	116	B	0.99998	50:47	56	Well, as we somewhat glide towards a local closure, of course anyone is welcome to bring up any reflections. And also, I'd love to hear about where we go from this now measured outcome. How do we prepare individually at the Institute scale, ecosystem scale, and what are we going to do coming out of this?
3089130	3091080	117	E	0.81514	51:29	7	Are we talking about that right now.
3097520	3126310	118	B	1.0	51:37	63	Or any thoughts? Yeah, keep learning, bro. What do you mean by the ecosystem scale? Like the active inference ecosystem and our own ecosystems going on our own scale. I guess the only thing I can comment on this is I echo the view that, or not view, or rather remark that Chris made in the lecture about quantum biology as a field.
3126920	3142110	119	E	0.99923	52:06	32	It's in a nascent stage, right? Mean, I think, you know, there will be a non trivial interaction between the active inference community and quantum biology. I'm making that surmise right now.
3152460	3173150	120	C	0.99007	52:32	66	So let's talk about quantum biology for a second, I'll open up the Pandora's box here. Let's think of it as a parable as opposed, or maybe even fan fiction. Because Chris has shared so much with us, I want to kind of build off of it. If you will indulge me for a second, I'll read you a little story. Just hear the story out.
3174320	3206520	121	C	0.61912	52:54	71	Quantum biology sounds like more than up or down without saying that it is more up or down as what information can be counterfactually is looking at carrying capacity as in quotes can be. And from that carrying capacity comes orientation. Things like direction and scale, things like the ability to plan appear to fit better in the orientation category relative to the carrying capacity category, which is noncommunativity in action.
3208780	3240420	122	C	0.99995	53:28	73	This is a big if we agree that orientation is to follow should our recognizing of planning affordances follow as well. So from the session slide, there was a quote. Living systems are genetic quantum systems that the FEP has driven to a high level of computational complexity. And here the in quotes computation is baked in as something planable with this as a reference frame. To make plans, we need carrying capacity.
3240840	3286120	123	C	0.65563	54:00	81	Check. Agreed. But in order to learn where does the carrying capacity plus orientation relationship insist that we start with a received plan? This perspective is compared to, say, actively inferring our way to the plan falls out of carrying capacity. Just making this explicit, we can then ask should we first apply a received plan or apply active inference that helps clarify when the strategy is one more based on exploitation versus a strategy more based and biased to exploration.
3286200	3338776	124	C	0.99999	54:46	116	In summary, when did information delivery things like product or package packaging begin to Trump information carrying capacity, which is essentially information processing rather than we need this paired relationship, the carrying capacity plus the orientation as a minimum of two so that we can compare, identify change and know change model patterns, et cetera. This is another way of asking when did subject matter expertise come to be seen as more valuable than prediction matter expertise? When it seems like we need both capacities if we want independency. And here's the kicker. If not given time to reflect on what's being asked here, and I know Chris oftentimes has a nice long pause to reflect.
3338888	3369560	125	C	0.99919	55:38	66	But if not given the time to reflect, people will take their subject matter expertise strategy, which clearly is a next move perspective over one that holds up next move plus all moves, meaning that they bring prediction matter expertise in to follow, to parameterize, to unlock, to unring, to unbound what's in and what's out. Of course, without prediction matter expertise, what is quantum biology?
3374080	3380610	126	F	0.9985	56:14	20	Wow. Can you just post that someplace so we can think about. I'll just email it to you, Chris. Cool.
3383300	3384530	127	D	0.99917	56:23	3	That was great.
3390330	3408720	128	E	0.96704	56:30	28	Yeah. I think you're asking about the fundamental question of what does Carl call it? Epistemic value and the role of curiosity and that whole cluster of issues.
3411570	3436870	129	C	0.87008	56:51	79	Well, I think I need to give you the credit that you deserve on this. I think it's the fact that you have allowed us to interact with you that's given us that kind of courage and confidence to be able to put things out there. I don't know how much of it sticks or how much of it. I'm not sure that it requires disciples, but I do think it provides. What you've done is provided that medium.
3437450	3442870	130	C	0.9982	57:17	14	So again, I guess that's my way of saying thank you. Well, thank. That's.
3447530	3454680	131	E	0.96479	57:27	15	Yeah. Thank you, Chris. I have learned so much this year, more than ever before.
3460050	3492070	132	F	0.74952	57:40	56	Okay, well, great. This has been a great class, and hopefully various things will come out of mean. Certainly just from looking at the questions that have been in the question forum. Lots of people are thinking about these issues, and that's what I think AI needs going forward, is people thinking and talking about stuff.
3495150	3541370	133	B	0.99998	58:15	84	Thank you, Chris. Yeah. A few outcomes that we know will transcribe the lectures, the discussions, add in screenshots, add in the Q and A, and publish those proceedings as a book. We will pick back up in 2024 with potentially having the recorded and written contents as part of a curriculum. So not just replicating, but now continuing on with another quantum flow across this now classical artifact, because it's quantum in the moment, and then once it's communicated, it becomes a classic.
3541870	3544140	134	E	0.96	59:01	8	And we have months to prepare that state.
3546190	3556510	135	F	0.95815	59:06	23	All right, great. I'm going to have to sign off, but thank you very much. Thank you, Chris. Thank you. Thank you, Chris.
3557730	3568930	136	F	0.4051	59:17	15	Ciao. Bye. Does anyone else, does anyone else want to make any reflection or comment?
3570950	3619538	137	C	1.0	59:30	111	I just thank everybody that's helped organize, participated in all of the discussions, even the people who showed up at the very end of the discussions, because I really appreciate that. Again, I cannot emphasize enough, when we get a chance to interact with this stuff, when we get to manipulate it, when we're able to ask questions, even though we feel vulnerable, I think that that's when a lot of the really good stuff tends to get consolidated. So thank you to all of you. I'll read some fun comments from the live chat, just the last several, just to recognize some of our great colleagues. Lucrative leadership wrote, yes.
3619624	3631240	138	B	1.0	1:00:19	31	More on affordances. Ian wrote, would love for this series to continue. Joanne wrote, thank you. This was a wonderful learning experience. Mills 81 Two wrote the probable and the possible.
3632010	3652642	139	B	0.99994	1:00:32	46	There are some emojis. Pablo sent a heart pow wow dao. I don't speak this language, but I can definitely hear, understand, and feel it. So thank you, everybody who's watching along. These were all great, and we prepare and measure every day at the institute.
3652726	3678900	140	B	0.99801	1:00:52	57	So I really do hope that people from all backgrounds, all vectors, all preference and prior sets come engage and not presuppose too much about us or themselves or what can happen when we really do interact and when we take it into the kinds of spaces and timelines that we know we want to be on.
3681990	3687730	141	B	0.99876	1:01:21	9	All right, thank you. Bye. Thank you, everyone. Bye.
