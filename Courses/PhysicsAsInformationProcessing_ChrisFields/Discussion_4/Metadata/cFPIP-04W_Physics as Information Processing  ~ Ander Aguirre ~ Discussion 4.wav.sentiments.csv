8730	9390	A	0.4896698594093323	All right.
9540	11070	A	0.915437638759613	Hello and welcome everyone.
11220	20570	A	0.8795886635780334	It is Saturday, August 26, 2023 and we're here in Physics as information processing in the fourth discussion.
20730	21470	A	0.9428777694702148	Thank you everybody.
21540	23550	A	0.9083883762359619	Who's joining live or watching?
23620	25266	A	0.8188358545303345	Live or watching in replay.
25418	28530	A	0.9810308218002319	This should be a really fun discussion as usual.
28690	43290	A	0.9069299697875977	So we're going to have Ander provide some slides and some initial clarifying questions for Chris and then we're going to open it up for our guests to ask some questions and check in a live chat, see what people are talking about.
43360	47050	A	0.8165078163146973	So Ander, to you for some slides and overview.
48030	48394	B	0.584351658821106	Okay.
48432	49222	B	0.8880262970924377	Thank you, Daniel.
49286	57614	B	0.9004517197608948	So last time we were starting to talk about multi agent communication and lock protocols and all of that.
57732	64430	B	0.851614773273468	So let's quickly go through the slides and sort of try to recall the main concepts.
66630	71170	B	0.8703791499137878	I guess just to go back to session three for a second.
71320	81350	B	0.8182343244552612	One takeaway was that when you have non committing sectors in a boundary, that's necessarily going to require classical communication between them.
81500	90170	B	0.7623616456985474	So that is more or less the whole point of today, how noncommittan sectors may communicate, have to communicate classically.
96110	108474	B	0.8522717356681824	Another introduction in this last lecture was this new graphical notation, TQFT, if you wish to call it that way for any of these clock ticks.
108522	134470	B	0.8241754770278931	Okay, so let's recall the whole process of measuring a sector environment and writing it into a memory environment can be simplified to this sort of tick that connects two portions of the boundary and everything we talk about lock protocols will be written in this graphical notation.
137550	142300	B	0.5326173901557922	So let's keep going a little bit.
143790	149562	B	0.9374104738235474	This slide is on the paper on sequential measurements from 2022.
149696	156858	B	0.8982859253883362	These are basically the formal mapping between QRFs and topological quantum field theories.
156954	157214	B	0.584351658821106	Okay.
157252	162714	B	0.8637181520462036	So we're more used to the picture here on the left hand side of this slide, right with the QRF sectors.
162762	167490	B	0.8167691826820374	But Pictorically speaking, this is at least how they map.
169110	169714	B	0.7123860716819763	Okay?
169832	178418	B	0.8656027913093567	And then from then we started talking about entanglement and classical communications using this notation.
178514	182120	B	0.8046813011169434	And this is probably where my questions to Chris will start.
182650	193770	B	0.9041363596916199	So in section Three, we saw this idea of the FEP asymptotically being the principle of unitarity, aka.
194830	216610	B	0.5702522397041321	Driving the system, the joint system, Alice and Bob to entanglement, which in this graphical notation, amounts to them sort of completing a cycle here where the QRFs are perfectly aligned, so that the S sector of one becomes the memory sector of the other.
216760	223490	B	0.7770322561264038	And vice I actually at this point already, I have a question for Chris.
223830	225220	B	0.6816273331642151	I have it written down.
230330	230886	B	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
230988	232790	B	0.8567050099372864	Two things here, Chris.
233530	246826	B	0.9078763127326965	Number one is in the log protocol picture we do have a distinguishing between a quantum channel and a classical channel.
247008	257962	B	0.873344361782074	And if I understood that part correctly, we said that passage of time or expenditure of energy, free energy only corresponds to the classical tick.
258106	270738	B	0.6590827107429504	So in this quantum entanglement picture where you don't quite have that, is it fair to say that there's no such thing as a classical take no passage of time, no expenditure of free energy.
270904	282582	B	0.5396977663040161	Is this a degenerate picture of the locked protocol where the sectors were aligned the right way and boom, you got rid of that classical thing and that's it.
282636	295020	B	0.8885940909385681	And secondly, I guess, what does it mean for these two parts, quote unquote from the paper, to implement a joint quantum process?
299860	311860	C	0.5330374240875244	So, yeah, this is not a lock protocol, clearly, because there is no classical communication.
312280	321012	C	0.8328295946121216	And in fact, Alice is not divided into multiple compartments.
321076	328410	C	0.8991024494171143	Here Alice is just implementing this single quantum process, Q.
329360	376308	C	0.5718116164207458	And because these sectors are because these QRFs are perfectly aligned, we can think of, remember from probably the second session the picture that you were very interested in under of the Wick rotation reversing time between Alice and Bob.
376484	388860	C	0.7138304114341736	So Alice's clock in fact ticks in the opposite direction from Bob's clock because both of their internal clocks are counting incoming bits, not outgoing.
390640	398930	C	0.8241111040115356	In this, in the right side of this picture, there is no overall time.
399620	410980	C	0.831493616104126	You can think of Alice's clock ticking forward one unit and then Bob's clock ticking backward one unit.
411720	422388	C	0.8379778265953064	So that the information flow is completely time symmetric between Alice and Bob.
422564	431550	C	0.874348521232605	So we can think of both of these processes, q and Q prime, as bi directional in time.
432480	435710	C	0.6573135852813721	That's what it means to have a pure unitary process.
438320	439784	B	0.7441754341125488	So no time asymmetry.
439832	440760	B	0.6558305621147156	That's what it is.
440850	441152	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
441206	444108	C	0.8235671520233154	So there is no time asymmetry in this picture.
444284	450300	C	0.7558692097663879	And when you introduce classical communication, of course you have to have a time asymmetry.
450460	450880	B	0.5664746165275574	Right.
450950	457700	C	0.8156395554542542	Because you have this I mean, classicality is defined by this notion of irreversibility.
458440	459060	B	0.5826064348220825	I see.
459130	462656	C	0.5575312376022339	Which is just the same as time asymmetry.
462848	465976	C	0.7313268184661865	And it's the irreversibility that burns energy.
466078	496970	C	0.8617444038391113	So there has to be energy flow between Alice and Bob to drive what is from a global point of view and only an apparent asymmetry, but from the point of view of Alice One and Alice Two as components of Alice, they're the ones who see the asymmetry.
501390	516026	B	0.9123203754425049	So I guess just to tie back to the question of the week rotation, once this joint process is implemented naively, one can say is this cycle going clockwise or counterclockwise?
516058	525700	B	0.7874156832695007	And is that going to define on originally whenever these guys ended up being lined up where the weak sign was coming from?
531770	532520	C	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
533530	539190	C	0.8703464269638062	Whenever Alice sees information flowing in, Bob sees information flowing out.
539260	544810	C	0.5569683909416199	So their WIC rotations are going in opposite directions.
546110	546860	B	0.584351658821106	Okay.
548990	551020	B	0.9279866814613342	Yeah, very good.
552830	585590	C	0.6197896599769592	The other thing to think of in this picture, Rich, it's impossible to draw all of these simultaneously, is that if you think of the FEP as fully aligning Alice and Bob, then not only do these processes perfectly couple, but the area that's green in this right hand side kind of expands to fill the whole boundary.
586250	599480	C	0.777336835861206	So that in the complete limit of Alice being able to perfectly predict Bob and vice versa, then the whole boundary is green.
600490	611870	C	0.6821271777153015	So there's no this distinction between the S sector and the Y sector disappears.
612930	615294	B	0.7882381677627563	Yes, that makes sense, actually.
615412	631138	B	0.8629118204116821	And just to conclude with this slide, back in the session two, we saw something about agents requiring a free choice of reference frame for their QRFs, which amounts to being able to choose how to measure a spin.
631234	632806	B	0.6017550230026245	Right, right.
632908	642150	B	0.8087482452392578	So is part of this entanglement picture, do they just have to align the sectors or also the way they are measuring a spin on those sectors?
643790	648598	C	0.8761452436447144	Yes, they have to align the way they're measuring the spin in those sectors.
648774	662990	C	0.6389793157577515	It's that lack of remember the point that free choice of local reference frame is required for separability.
663890	677300	C	0.8571042418479919	So as the systems become fully entangled, then their local reference frames for each qubit become the same.
678230	680500	C	0.5934682488441467	Become necessarily the same.
685170	686078	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
686244	686622	B	0.584351658821106	Okay.
686676	688880	B	0.7592599987983704	And then let's continue a little bit.
689250	695250	B	0.6497634649276733	So in this talk, we're mainly interested on QRFs that do not commute.
695990	706754	B	0.5860245227813721	Now, maybe, Chris, you can tie this back to what you were saying earlier about if you're perfectly entangled, then the sector is going to grow.
706792	708166	B	0.8296701908111572	Does it have anything to do with this?
708188	717720	B	0.8541702628135681	So if Q one and Q two here do commute, then how do you reduce this to the picture on the right hand side?
718490	725130	B	0.8953173756599426	At the first glance, it looks like the picture on the left hand side encompasses more sectors of the boundary.
727390	728090	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
728240	776710	C	0.845991313457489	The point here is just that if we go back and go back to the notation where what we're representing by this simplified notation is a collection of cocon diagrams, and if these reference frames commute, then one can take these two diagrams and find a think of it in the information inflow direction.
778490	795330	C	0.789495587348938	There will always be a common cocon over the two sets of input classifiers if the two QRFs commute.
796070	819534	C	0.8615309596061707	So what that means is that I go from a diagram with two sets of classifiers, each going up to some apex, to a diagram with the merged set of classifiers going up to some farther up the hierarchy apex because they commute.
819602	828570	C	0.5063441395759583	I can find that sort of yet more abstract coconut that covers all of the classifiers in both QRS.
830270	839034	C	0.8080300688743591	So that just collapses these pairs of green segments down to one green segment.
839082	840830	C	0.8345217704772949	And I've drawn it the same size.
840900	845154	C	0.6378830671310425	I mean, it would make more sense graphically, I suppose, to draw it.
845272	845842	B	0.5664746165275574	Right.
845976	850740	C	0.788250744342804	Each one is twice as big or twice the area.
851270	865800	C	0.7008168697357178	But keeping to this kind of very topological representation where the area isn't actually meaningful, it is convenient to draw it this way.
866330	866982	B	0.5664746165275574	Right.
867116	872810	B	0.7631040811538696	So in short, commutative the fact that they commute means that you will have that higher apex anyway.
872880	875670	B	0.8188201189041138	So you can bypass that first nesting.
875830	876202	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
876256	879530	B	0.8277477622032166	But it comes to the number of degrees of freedom at the boundary.
879950	881098	B	0.5424507856369019	They're still the same.
881184	884170	B	0.5366833209991455	And in terms of area right, okay.
884240	884630	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
884720	891600	C	0.575768768787384	We're not getting rid of any of the degrees of freedom of the boundary that these QRFs are looking at.
893170	894750	B	0.9279866814613342	Yeah, very good.
894820	898706	B	0.9603403210639954	So the next slide I found a very interesting one.
898728	912070	B	0.6280737519264221	So these are no Go theorems things that Alice and Bob cannot do, and it's mainly having to do about measuring their own entanglement entropy and counting degrees of freedom.
913850	922554	B	0.8249027132987976	I guess this has a very holographic feel to it, and also maybe even a bit of a Goddess theorem feel to it.
922592	925420	B	0.5859840512275696	So I don't know if Chris wants to comment on that.
927950	951250	C	0.5016899704933167	Well, I'll just say that I think this does have a kind of girdle undecidability feel to it, in that there are a large number of questions that Alice can't answer, which certainly suggests a formulation in terms of incompleteness.
952310	968150	C	0.8166576027870178	And the connection to Gertle's theorem is actually something that Jim Glazberg and I are currently working on, and hopefully we'll be able to make that connection more precise.
968730	990090	C	0.6025323867797852	But the point of these statements is just to emphasize that a single observer that's uncompartmentalized cannot determine anything about the entanglement entropy of the environment.
990250	999214	C	0.5627107620239258	And this is just the result that to measure entanglement, you have to employ a lock protocol.
999262	1001730	C	0.8263822793960571	So you have to have classical communication.
1002710	1028700	C	0.49659764766693115	And this raises a fundamental issue in the theory, and that classical communication is an exchange of information that cannot be represented as a single quantum process.
1029390	1051570	C	0.8454137444496155	Hence, you have language like the collapse of the wave function or these various other decoherence, et cetera, et cetera, these various ways of trying to capture this idea that something different and irreversible is happening as soon as you talk about classical communication.
1052950	1065030	C	0.7875576615333557	So the point is, for Alice to measure anything about the entanglement entropy of Bob, she has to be sectored.
1066250	1074122	C	0.5208630561828613	So her entanglement entropy has to decrease, but she can't know that.
1074256	1080700	C	0.6651972532272339	She can't actually know that she has sectored compartments when we think of Alice as an entire system.
1081470	1094030	C	0.8258898854255676	So from now on, we're going to be talking about the very limited points of view of particular observers.
1094870	1099218	C	0.8001972436904907	And to talk about that.
1099384	1121414	C	0.7167391777038574	I think it's very important to keep these various limitations in mind, because there's a real distinction between what we can say effectively from this kind of God's eye point of view that we're adopting.
1121462	1143838	C	0.9271610975265503	As theorists where we say Alice has sectors that are communicating classically and what Alice's system can do from her point of view or her sectors can do from their points of view.
1144004	1150420	C	0.7067202925682068	And this is a distinction that's often ignored, but it's important to keep it in mind.
1157190	1157940	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
1158310	1161330	A	0.9245922565460205	Thanks for this line ender.
1161690	1162198	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1162284	1164280	B	0.8745568990707397	So should we continue?
1165130	1188350	B	0.791878342628479	Yeah, then I guess we get to the proper material of the last lecture, which is what happens when you have sectors that are commutative, such as two portions of Alice involved that have to communicate classically.
1189010	1191950	B	0.8121498227119446	This is what requires the classical communication tick.
1195330	1196400	B	0.6551274657249451	Let me see.
1197910	1211074	B	0.821425199508667	So would it be fair to say, Chris, this only such a classical channel, such as the one shown in this slide requires free energy.
1211272	1212178	B	0.7965733408927917	Is that right?
1212264	1215750	B	0.8931207656860352	Because there's some writing into a memory involved in here.
1215900	1223114	B	0.7419313192367554	Compared to the earlier slide where we had that closed loop in the entangled picture, there was no expenditure of energy.
1223152	1223900	B	0.6270087361335754	Is that.
1227390	1239040	C	0.8692901134490967	The the example to keep in mind here is exactly the process that we're executing right now.
1241570	1249730	C	0.90302973985672	Alice has two components, and we are currently in the position of those components.
1250470	1260870	C	0.6839907765388489	And we're communicating classically with each other by employing a channel that's part of our shared environment.
1261690	1268390	C	0.7527972459793091	So we are acting irreversibly on our shared environment.
1269770	1279020	C	0.7568285465240479	And it's that irreversible action on the environment that has the free energy cost for each of us.
1281070	1293520	C	0.759432315826416	We actually have to make noise to communicate, and our laptops are actually consuming power.
1294130	1296118	C	0.7693016529083252	All of this is classical.
1296314	1302850	C	0.5922088027000427	It's this irreversibility that defines classicality.
1304710	1305362	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
1305496	1312194	B	0.8893517255783081	And to continue with this question, I guess it will come ensure in later slides.
1312242	1315334	B	0.8688997030258179	But the other side of this lock protocol is the quantum channel.
1315452	1334810	B	0.579590380191803	And my question to you, Chris, is just like there is an expenditure of time and energy involved in this classical channel, is the quantum channel basically the opposite of that meaning its action is instantaneous entanglement, presumably.
1334970	1343680	B	0.6234602928161621	And also, again, back to that loop picture of entangled cycle, is there just no passage of time, no expenditure of energy?
1344690	1346740	B	0.5856549739837646	Does any of that make sense?
1348150	1348610	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1348680	1356820	C	0.5751058459281921	And I think it's worth actually going to the next slide here where we complete the loop and add the quantum channel.
1359450	1360662	B	0.8593581914901733	Is it this one?
1360796	1361480	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1364090	1394030	C	0.6157275438308716	I think to understand what's going on here, I think it's very useful to think of it in terms of a Belly PR experiment, right, where Bob, in this case, the shared environment includes the source that's creating the entangled pair, which a one and a two observe simultaneously.
1394930	1403502	C	0.8306442499160767	They interact simultaneously with their two detectors, which are interacting with the entangled pair.
1403566	1414760	C	0.8392260074615479	So you can think of their two detectors are entangled, and it's only later that they exchange this classical information.
1415690	1452450	C	0.8067184090614319	And in a Belly PR experiment, the elapsed time between the source emitting the entangled pair and the entangled pair interacting with the detectors deployed by a one and a two is designed as part of the experimental protocol to be less than the time that it is required for a one and a two to communicate classically.
1453670	1461800	C	0.6860939860343933	And notice that from the point of view of the entangled pair itself, no time has passed at all.
1462330	1463080	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
1463850	1474010	C	0.8622280359268188	The entangled pair is, from a special relativity point of view, moving along a light like trajectory.
1474830	1481770	C	0.7558256387710571	So there's no distance being traversed and no time is elapsing.
1482270	1493470	C	0.895126461982727	From the point of view of the entangled pair, there's only an elapsed time and a traverse distance in the coordinates of the observers.
1495330	1503490	C	0.8785029053688049	And it's those coordinates that define the parameters for the observer's eventual classical communication.
1506870	1520390	C	0.9196129441261292	So this is why I characterized the assumption of classical communication as a stipulation and also why I characterized it as a fine tuning assumption.
1522350	1548930	C	0.7041387557983398	We are assuming something very specific about this communication channel, and we're assuming that the part of Bob, the part of the shared environment that implements this classical communication channel, behaves differently from the rest of the shared environment.
1550470	1559350	C	0.6643422245979309	It behaves in a way that is classical, but the rest of the shared environment doesn't.
1559930	1560390	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
1560460	1564550	C	0.8401387333869934	The rest of the world is described using quantum theory.
1564890	1579260	C	0.7443235516548157	So we're making this assumption that part of the shared environment is special, and the specialness is that it behaves in this classical way.
1582270	1584666	B	0.7866641283035278	So let me finish with this slide.
1584698	1596850	B	0.5224620699882507	I suppose to go back to my earlier question about that Entangled loop being at least Pictorically appears to be like a degenerate version of this log picture.
1597510	1616322	B	0.7003800868988037	If in this log picture I have the quantum channel on the right, that hypothetical entanglement to complete the cycle on the left was only broken when a one and a two chose to write that into their memories at different sectors.
1616386	1616758	B	0.5664746165275574	Right.
1616844	1621346	B	0.8830937147140503	And then that eventually necessitated the classical communication between them.
1621468	1622460	B	0.8415143489837646	Is that correct?
1623630	1624380	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1628270	1642190	C	0.845943808555603	One could always take the point of view of, if you will, the observer who's outside the entire universe and just sees the entire universe evolving unitarily.
1643650	1649650	C	0.566034734249115	And from that point of view, there's no such thing as classical communication.
1650230	1658370	C	0.8061854839324951	So the communication is classical only relative to this division between the Observers.
1659610	1670310	C	0.78282231092453	And that division between the observers corresponds to their measurement procedures, not commuting.
1671230	1693390	C	0.888278603553772	So it corresponds to what we think of classically as Alice acting on her half of the entangled state, determining what Bob will, then that all of that causal language is classical.
1694050	1694800	B	0.5664746165275574	Right.
1698070	1700450	B	0.8446594476699829	We're like at 1130.
1700520	1712200	B	0.8974817991256714	So halfway, more or less, let's say a few words on the later slide process and all of that.
1714410	1724774	B	0.8140643835067749	I guess before we start talking about this, which will take us like five to ten minutes at most, could you say a few words again about the fine tuning assumption?
1724822	1734010	B	0.6362272500991821	So I still can't quite understand what is meant here, that this whole classical communication stuff requires fine tuning.
1743020	1743720	C	0.584351658821106	Okay.
1743870	1758140	C	0.8088376522064209	I think a way to think about it is to think about what it means to say that Alice and Bob are able to communicate classically.
1760960	1766068	C	0.8928727507591248	What we're saying is that Alice and Bob share some sort of language.
1766184	1773570	C	0.86786288022995	So when they exchange their data, we can think of their data as written in some binary code in a data.
1775460	1784240	C	0.8984649777412415	Alice says, I set my instrument this way and I saw this spin.
1784820	1789596	C	0.8859152793884277	I then set my instrument this other way, and I made this observation.
1789788	1802360	C	0.8839704394340515	So Alice, his data table, or a one's data table, is just a long table with two entries in each row.
1802940	1811180	C	0.87184077501297	One entry is how the detector was adjusted, and the other entry is what the value of the spin was observed.
1811920	1814270	C	0.7425169944763184	And Bob's data table looks the same.
1814640	1822480	C	0.8688427209854126	And so they share this information, or they share it with some third party, they communicate it classically.
1823220	1826780	C	0.8552220463752747	And there are two aspects to that classical communication.
1826860	1841690	C	0.7174099087715149	One is that up to classical noise, their data tables don't change when they share them.
1842380	1847610	C	0.7310664057731628	So they really are irreversibly recorded.
1847980	1854860	C	0.49964439868927	They're not evolving in time along with the rest of the universe.
1856720	1881540	C	0.7366612553596497	The other aspect is that we have to assume that Alice and Bob mean the same thing by their notations in these data tables so that they can actually compare them, so that they can actually do the statistics and see if they've violated Bell's inequality.
1882280	1909196	C	0.8333693742752075	So what that means is we have to assume that they actually share a definition of up, and that when they talk about changing the settings on their instruments, they're talking about changing those settings with respect to some shared definition of, you know, in a real experiment, that shared definition of up is provided by the Earth's gravitational field or something like that.
1909378	1914300	C	0.8673879504203796	Earth's magnetic field, some shared environmental variable.
1915940	1941540	C	0.6379485726356506	So now it seems like we have a situation in which Alice One and Alice Two should be entangled because they share this reference frame that enables them to communicate classically, but they can't be entangled if they're going to communicate classically.
1945500	1956220	C	0.8260987997055054	So we make an assumption that in just this case, they share a reference frame, but they're not entangled.
1957840	1962380	C	0.6888566017150879	They're able to communicate classically while sharing the reference frame.
1963040	1974450	C	0.894712507724762	And we can sort of wave our hands and say they only share the reference frame up to some measurement resolution or something like that.
1975220	1993012	C	0.6180868744850159	But despite the hand waving, we're making a very specific assumption that violates the fact that reference frame sharing induces entanglement.
1993156	1995800	C	0.8041430711746216	So that's the fine tuning assumption.
1996540	2008620	C	0.7141372561454773	We assume that the universe is such that in this very specific kind of case, we can have reference frame sharing without entanglement.
2013200	2013950	B	0.84200119972229	Cool.
2015760	2026370	A	0.8969719409942627	Let's keep it here and just open it up a little bit if Harris or Dean want to just give any thought or reflection on what we've gotten to so far.
2028440	2030870	A	0.8275075554847717	Harris, if you want to, please.
2031880	2032724	D	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
2032922	2034470	D	0.9752874374389648	Everything is very interesting.
2035880	2041270	D	0.7893138527870178	Basically, I was listening with great, let's say focus.
2041660	2049608	D	0.8986185789108276	It reminded me this, let's say, elaboration on the previous talk that Chris gave two weeks ago.
2049774	2054350	D	0.8201507925987244	It reminded me something that Michael Levin said some time ago.
2055600	2061630	D	0.8791589140892029	It is regarding this amazing ability of cognition to scale up.
2062000	2072556	D	0.8582525849342346	So it's not only this understanding, let's say, of the scattering of cognition, but also the scaling up of cognition.
2072748	2091424	D	0.670379638671875	And when I tried to get inside my head, actually, that as Chris said in one of his talks, that if a system is a tag wall, one cannot draw a meaningful boundary across it.
2091562	2104940	D	0.9112941026687622	So this fine tuning, let's say elaboration that was made right now actually helps me understand that even better.
2105010	2109390	D	0.9607256650924683	So thank you, Chris, for that and thank you Ander for this.
2114320	2114924	C	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
2114962	2115500	C	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
2115570	2117040	C	0.9327327013015747	I'm glad that helped.
2119060	2141960	C	0.7085486054420471	Yeah, I think this is intimately related to the question of what cognition is since if we have a purely quantum system, there really is a deep sense in which nothing is happening because of the time symmetry.
2142620	2151000	C	0.8554044961929321	So to talk about cognition as something that actually occurs, we have to think of it classically.
2155440	2156344	D	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
2156482	2169860	D	0.8963079452514648	Also, if you allow me another comment on that, basically one of the comments posted during your last talk in the chat had to do with classical memories.
2170200	2177940	D	0.7874870300292969	And I was thinking about that and I came to the conclusion that classical memories presupposes a gestation period.
2178520	2183240	D	0.7578290700912476	And when I think about it, that actually makes sense.
2183390	2189812	D	0.7907592058181763	And it is true, let's say, for both physical and psychological reasons.
2189956	2202744	D	0.8512495160102844	So, for example, a hard disk needs to write data on its magnetic surface and a human brain needs to consolidate all those neural connections through synaptic plasticity.
2202792	2203580	D	0.7387031316757202	Let's say.
2203730	2227360	D	0.8370662927627563	However, when we start thinking about quantum information and quantum memories, let's say we realize that such memories will be such quantum memories basically will be stored in qubits or in those entagle states that you describe.
2227520	2231540	D	0.7560324668884277	So they do not necessarily have the same limitations.
2231980	2250312	D	0.7534640431404114	And of course, quantum information theory suggests, as I understand it, that quantum memories can be created and accessed instantaneously without any form of ingestation, let's say without any ingestation period.
2250456	2268508	D	0.7356135845184326	And of course this goes back and it has the potential, as I see, to revolutionize computation in terms of quantum computation, but also, and most importantly, communication and quantum cryptography even.
2268694	2274550	D	0.9535384774208069	And this is something that I am truly interested in.
2275240	2279350	D	0.7979074120521545	So yeah, I just wanted to share also that.
2283740	2286570	C	0.958389937877655	Yeah, that's a very good point.
2288540	2314960	C	0.7743390202522278	And the flip side is the issue of stability which again gets to the notion of environmental decoherence which is just the process of observation of the quantum state by some environment or some observer, some component of its environment.
2316020	2330150	C	0.7694802284240723	And the reason this is a problem in practice is that we don't have complete control of all components of the environment, right?
2331580	2352780	C	0.7487248182296753	So we have to use things like liquid helium to try to keep the environment at bay to prevent decoherence because any other components of the environment interacting with our quantum memory will alter the state of the memory.
2356660	2366160	D	0.9021686911582947	Yeah, that is a great answer and basically the reason why I typed that question.
2366230	2375720	D	0.8663253784179688	Regarding super selection rules, and namely me, I propose something called fuzzy super selection rules.
2376700	2403280	D	0.7124274373054504	Basically, as I understand it, those super selection rules, the classical ones, let's say they are based on symmetries or on all those conversation laws that actually limit the accessibility or our capacity to measure, let's say, certain quantum properties, let's say, maybe it's parity, maybe it's angular momentum, maybe it's even charge.
2403940	2426740	D	0.8152623176574707	But if we start thinking like these fuzzy super selection rules in an effort to relax these restrictions by allowing some degree of coherence or interference between the different super selected sectors, which can be quantified, let's say, by a parameter called fuzziness.
2426900	2446496	D	0.79292893409729	I know that in other fields, like in my field, that is fuzzy cognitive mapping, the introduction of fuzziness from as it was propounded by Professor Lotfield Zadek, it actually helped a lot of our models to become more accurate, let's say.
2446598	2449484	D	0.8428937792778015	So this is what I am proposing.
2449532	2464672	D	0.5670201778411865	Maybe of course, I don't expect it to revolutionize quantum information, but maybe it can help us understand a bit better what is going on and the role of the coherence that comes out of the environment.
2464736	2474650	D	0.6540992259979248	So if we incorporate it as a parameter of fuzziness, a priority, then maybe we can understand and even what we are dealing with.
2478510	2479260	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2481150	2487450	C	0.9058476686477661	I would refer you to the paper by Bartlett.
2489730	2500478	C	0.8186143636703491	There are two other co authors in 2007, a lovely review of quantum reference frames in reviews of modern Physics.
2500654	2512950	C	0.8154768347740173	And a point that they make that I think is relevant here is that a super selection rule can always be interpreted.
2514410	2515480	C	0.6551274657249451	Let me see.
2516250	2532330	C	0.5657138824462891	I'm not sure I'll be able to completely reproduce their argument, but they show that a super selection rule can always be interpreted as the absence of a reference frame or the lack of a reference frame.
2532750	2546270	C	0.6357697248458862	And one of the examples that they give is charge conservation, that we never see superpositions of different electric charges.
2547750	2555234	C	0.7013680934906006	And their point is we never see this because we have no way of measuring it.
2555272	2569030	C	0.5424013137817383	We have no reference frame that we could use that would allow us to see a state of superposed charges.
2570490	2587150	C	0.7581696510314941	And effectively what they're saying is our reference frames are all made of matter that is composed of stuff that has well defined electric charges.
2587570	2592906	C	0.5175334811210632	So we can't see things that are superpositions of charge.
2593018	2598160	C	0.6106313467025757	And it's very difficult for us to see things that are superpositions of position.
2599910	2623658	C	0.6426978707313538	So this question of what is a super selection rule, why do we have these rules, at least in their reasoning, boils down to the question of why do we have some reference frames or some measurement capabilities and not others?
2623744	2632970	C	0.6368849277496338	What is it about us that limits in some fundamental way our ability to make measurements?
2634190	2663160	C	0.7822064757347107	And I suspect that when you talk about fuzziness, which is a sense of classical uncertainty, that you may be sort of pointing in that direction, but I think it would be worth looking at that paper, which is largely written in English, right?
2663690	2667590	C	0.7960687875747681	The formalism is kept in the background.
2669690	2671880	C	0.9787763953208923	So it's a very nice paper.
2675150	2676140	D	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
2678270	2679260	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
2679870	2680502	A	0.6135209202766418	Andrew.
2680566	2682010	A	0.741931676864624	Maybe mute a little bit.
2682160	2687520	A	0.49309802055358887	Dean on the Mountaintop, what can you throw down on us?
2691910	2695778	E	0.6455201506614685	I don't have anything super special throw down.
2695944	2709218	E	0.6741863489151001	I have a question, though, and because I am very comfortable in that fuzzy space, I kind of see relationships and their lack of definability as a feature.
2709314	2712040	E	0.8500169515609741	So here's kind of my question.
2713450	2717594	E	0.8403564691543579	So you talked about a minimum sort of two different memories to encode something in time.
2717632	2726122	E	0.821568489074707	And I think it was one of the slides just after the one that's up here right now, which sounds to me like somewhere processing capacity.
2726186	2739234	E	0.8072947859764099	It sounds like we are kind of stepping back and trying to look at this instantaneous thing from the relative position of even the things that are classical can be seen as all.
2739432	2743940	E	0.9066595435142517	So that when you mentioned that earlier, Chris, that helped me quite a bit.
2744950	2749182	E	0.8772829174995422	Which then manifests itself as a classical ability to process somewhere.
2749326	2754390	E	0.6160683035850525	I spent a lot of my career self labeling as a wayfinder.
2755210	2758200	E	0.518541157245636	So not capacity realization, relationship.
2760810	2762358	E	0.6403509974479675	Just as a relationship.
2762524	2772746	E	0.8205408453941345	It means that wayfinding is not just an orienting or a processing where I am and being gripped by sort of the thing that I'm enveloped by.
2772768	2779450	E	0.6880497932434082	It's also the channel, the screen, the bound, the divide, the gap, the unentangled potentiator.
2779610	2784960	E	0.8733457326889038	It's the thing upon which traction can exist as being a gripper as well.
2787810	2799758	E	0.6229151487350464	I was already hung up on I wanted to go back like Colombo in that old 70s TV show and talk about Z spin because I think Z spin is an energy way of describing.
2799934	2815290	E	0.6617235541343689	But I honestly think when I went back and watched your presentation a couple of times, I'm starting to get a sense that Z spin is also relationship it's that affordance, that allows us to be able to see up and down.
2815440	2836798	E	0.8356667757034302	But I'm just curious, Chris, are we really talking about processing somewhere in the classical sense, but because we have these two ways of encoding different memories, we're also talking about somewhere processing just that state that allows for that's.
2836894	2843460	E	0.83160799741745	My question is that what we're really getting, are we trying to open that up, that possibility up?
2848230	2853400	C	0.9351227283477783	Yeah, I think that's a nice way to think about it.
2856170	2871180	C	0.8723394274711609	I think we're trying to, at some deep level come up with a way of describing what it means to be an agent.
2873810	2892180	C	0.8740683794021606	And I'll say in our case, a self conscious agent with a sense of time that's embedded in an environment that we depend on to store memories for us.
2893030	2918250	C	0.82242351770401	And what I mean by that is that we depend on the environment to change very slowly, at least from our point of view, so that we can keep some sense of our orientation within the environment.
2919310	2919770	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2919840	2934720	C	0.7100982069969177	We're using everything we see as a memory that allows us to keep ourselves fixed, which allows us to have a point of view.
2935990	2948500	C	0.7806624174118042	So we're using the entire visible environment as, if you will, a reference frame against which we can see small changes.
2949610	2964060	C	0.6232341527938843	But if the environment was constantly and rapidly changing, we wouldn't be able to do that and we wouldn't be able to use it as a memory and so we would have no point of view.
2965070	2978960	C	0.659228503704071	So in a sense, I think what we're talking about here is the miracle of having a point of view that gives us a sense of time.
2984320	2985980	C	0.6590262651443481	That's very philosophical.
2988980	2989856	A	0.9510914087295532	It's amazing.
2989958	2997936	A	0.8990172743797302	And I wonder if along with the perspectival visual advancements which you and.
2997958	2999564	A	0.9097978472709656	Shannon Dobson have explored.
2999612	3001940	A	0.8180820345878601	In the math art settings.
3002520	3023572	A	0.7264859080314636	You're almost bringing that kind of a transformative re understanding or re quantum reference framing into a temporal setting where it's not just a static spatial parallax that we are aesthetically and formally re understanding.
3023636	3048320	A	0.8364225625991821	But also a temporal one, which, in an agent environment system, necessitates these questions of communication, which, in the quantum information formalism, are approached topologically rather than geometrically, which is what we needed for the kind of vanishing point type math art in the spatial setting.
3050900	3059908	C	0.7999886870384216	Well, I think they're approached geometrically eventually and that's really what the session in September will be about.
3060074	3084190	C	0.828781247138977	It's how to start with this very topological picture where we're only talking about interactions in a sense, interactions in time, but outside of space and layer a spatial structure on top of that.
3085360	3115690	C	0.7932169437408447	And I think this is particularly interesting in this active inference context because it immediately raises biological questions about the ability of different organisms to layer space on their experience and hence locate themselves, if you will, within some sort of perceived world.
3120060	3120664	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
3120782	3124170	A	0.9013099670410156	Dean and then back to Ander for the last minutes.
3129180	3130056	A	0.5700177550315857	Oh, wait, unmute.
3130088	3131710	A	0.8004792332649231	Dean and then please continue.
3133440	3134190	E	0.5092127919197083	Sorry.
3134640	3154790	E	0.8007591366767883	So, Chris, is it from the pure neophyte perspective that I have, is it OK to say that it's not just a flipping of position of words, that somewhere processing, that availability and processing somewhere in the classical sense, where am I?
3155160	3164630	E	0.5699409246444702	It's our ability to fuse those, as you mentioned, we can slow down, we can stabilize, we can see that relationship.
3165100	3175050	E	0.8835160732269287	Or is it about spinning?
3179230	3182140	C	0.7914022207260132	I think the former, right.
3182610	3190350	C	0.7498679757118225	Spin is a very convenient abstraction for talking about binary encoding.
3193840	3203324	C	0.8632023930549622	And we have this felt sense of spin, but its use in physics is very much an abstraction.
3203452	3207840	C	0.8558700084686279	I mean, the difference between a proton and neutron is a spin variable.
3212810	3213560	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
3214170	3224360	A	0.8856232762336731	Ander you can in the last minutes take it where you need also unmute and then continue.
3226110	3227660	B	0.8314754962921143	Can you guys hear me now?
3228430	3232714	B	0.7007206082344055	So let's hope that I have time for Chris to address a couple of things.
3232832	3239690	B	0.742861270904541	So just to conclude the slides and then hopefully we get to say a few words on quantum Darwinism.
3239850	3248640	B	0.8753768801689148	So towards the end, the slides appear to start pivoting towards the next subject, which is space and time.
3249030	3264870	B	0.7203040719032288	And here in particular, we see the earlier slide showcasing the Lock protocol where you can notice that half of it has been cut and has been moved to the future.
3264940	3270840	B	0.8130553960800171	So here we don't have two sectors of Alice communicating, but rather Alice communicating with its future.
3271450	3274098	B	0.8228897452354431	Still, you have the classical and the quantum channel.
3274284	3289520	B	0.8923386335372925	Now, one question that I brought up, I remember and in the lecture, and maybe we can expand on a little more, was exactly what is the difference between this quantum and the classical channel part?
3290450	3295610	B	0.8870208859443665	Something I heard Chris say is that it is crucial for the quantum channel to be recohered.
3295690	3305060	B	0.8515374660491943	So this is going to be some sort of unitary scattering evolution that is completely independent of everything else going on.
3305750	3307938	B	0.8355593085289001	Is that correct or should be?
3307944	3308770	B	0.753897488117218	In theory.
3313120	3313870	C	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
3315540	3324988	B	0.7147653698921204	And I suppose, just like earlier, the classical channel is the part that takes time and free energy expenditure.
3325164	3340490	B	0.7773509621620178	Now, my question to you, Chris, is not the channels in the middle, but the ticks on either side of the boundaries that have been broken down and separated in terms of an external time.
3341180	3344964	B	0.6307811141014099	What's up with those ticks from one sector to the other of the boundary?
3345092	3352984	B	0.8921073079109192	So in Q one, for example, the lower TRF sector, that's that amount to a state was prepared.
3353112	3357004	B	0.8847347497940063	The upper one was I made a memory record of that state.
3357122	3358670	B	0.7333572506904602	That's what it is, right?
3359680	3360430	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3360800	3370610	B	0.8815870881080627	Okay, so in the lower sector, we both had a preparation and a measurement, and a measurement was recorded classically here.
3371540	3372850	B	0.6673710942268372	That's all there is.
3374020	3374816	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3374998	3379750	C	0.8685749173164368	So preparation and measurement are effectively the same process.
3381960	3409890	C	0.8599170446395874	And you can think of in a one of T, what a one is doing is, from an operational point of view, she's preparing an instrument and turning it on.
3410820	3443260	C	0.8644591569900513	She's creating an initial state, and she's simultaneously encoding a memory someplace in her head or on a piece of paper of what those preparation conditions were, because it's only with respect to the memory of what the preparation conditions were that the later measurement is meaningful.
3448560	3451980	C	0.8182885646820068	Let's go back to just preparing a spin.
3453780	3454624	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
3454822	3468420	C	0.9132504463195801	At T, she may set the angle of some polarization filter that defines a propagating beam of photons.
3469320	3475812	C	0.8948847651481628	And at T plus delta T, she measures something about what those photons are doing.
3475946	3487210	C	0.8798601031303406	But the measurement is only meaningful with respect to her memory of what the polarization setting that prepared the photons was.
3489260	3512720	C	0.7356781363487244	So effectively, what's going on in the quantum channel is an experiment, and it's the classical information that's preserved in this classical channel that makes the experiment meaningful or interpretable or informative.
3513060	3514320	B	0.5614707469940186	Yeah, for sure.
3514470	3517904	B	0.6968091726303101	Yeah, that makes perfect sense in preparation of measurement.
3517952	3532630	B	0.9161911010742188	This ties back to an earlier question we had both happen simultaneously at the same degree of freedom at the boundary, or do we have preparation at the lower bound measurement at the top of one?
3536140	3548424	C	0.8562136888504028	Yeah, one can think of that operator, Mi, if you remember the decomposition of the Hamiltonian as preparing or measuring.
3548552	3553144	C	0.7736010551452637	It's just a matter of interpretation effectively.
3553192	3556050	C	0.777949333190918	Is it acting to the left or acting to the right?
3558260	3558912	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3559046	3559344	B	0.584351658821106	Okay.
3559382	3559968	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3560134	3561072	B	0.8747984170913696	Makes perfect.
3561206	3572230	B	0.8306410908699036	And then before we get to quantum error correction as more of a special instead of a time thing, I wanted to ask about yet another question between this one.
3573400	3588170	B	0.8928747177124023	So the quantum channels does involve some sort of time evolutionary portion, that is, this portion that is evolving unitarily with no interference from the outside.
3589100	3603640	B	0.717540979385376	However, as you said, for this experiment to make sense, you need to have a classical memory of how that experiment was prepared so that means that that classical guy on top is static.
3603720	3605470	B	0.6621694564819336	There's no time flow in it.
3607140	3617030	C	0.7282689213752747	Well, this actually gets back to the talk by Suskin that we were talking about before we started here that you kindly referred me to.
3620360	3631800	C	0.8947889804840088	Part of this classical memory is memory for what counts as a classical clock.
3632620	3636516	C	0.7334701418876648	And we'll actually get to this again in the September session.
3636708	3662400	C	0.87360018491745	But if you think again about doing an experiment in which a state is prepared and then it's measured, this quantum process is a process through time with respect to some classical clock that actually provides the time coordinate for the experiment.
3663700	3683620	C	0.91239333152771	So this classical clock is some external reference frame that a one here in this notation is using as part of her classical memory.
3685480	3685904	B	0.5664746165275574	Right.
3685962	3692090	C	0.6183558106422424	Again, it's a memory because it's something that's assumed not to change.
3695600	3710130	C	0.7598214149475098	This will be kind of the heart of the discussion in September that time and memory and object persistence are all different names for this same assumption that we make about the world.
3717160	3718420	A	0.8918594717979431	Thank you, Chris.
3719000	3719796	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3719898	3722310	C	0.7615041732788086	I am going to have to so.
3723480	3725110	A	0.7840880155563354	Only for now though.
3725800	3727510	C	0.7552651762962341	Yeah, only for now.
3728220	3730760	C	0.8480693697929382	I will nonetheless persist someplace.
3731820	3734660	B	0.9779640436172485	Thank you, Chris, so much, Chris.
3734820	3736410	C	0.9497865438461304	Okay, awesome.
3737100	3737816	C	0.639849066734314	See you.
3737918	3739050	C	0.9063448905944824	Thanks very much.
3739580	3740890	A	0.6410980820655823	Measure you later.
3745500	3761490	A	0.9278661012649536	Andrew, if you wanted to drop any other cues or clues or bring us a little bit of a preparation for where we're going to be heading in lecture five, that would be pretty cool.
3763300	3763712	B	0.4753468334674835	Sure.
3763766	3768150	B	0.8569384217262268	So, I mean, I'm a little aware of what's coming in lecture five.
3769560	3786244	B	0.8454016447067261	It's about space and time and how space may be sorry, time may be a little more fundamental than space for reasons that Chris will show has a lot to do with the notion of how you define a clock.
3786372	3796696	B	0.6465840339660645	As in we need to think hard about what are the bare minimum ingredients for you to talk about the existence of a clock.
3796888	3801528	B	0.6250479817390442	These are deep, fundamental, almost philosophical questions that are overlooked.
3801704	3815004	B	0.964901328086853	And the good news, and that's the Saskin talk that Chris and I were referring to is that other people, especially in the high energy community, are also looking into these questions, which is very reassuring.
3815052	3830570	B	0.9093056917190552	So I'm talking at Wheaton, Suskin, Harlow, Et are there is a recent talk on YouTube where they talk about what does it mean for something to be a does, how long does a clock last?
3830940	3833770	B	0.8985714912414551	And then Chris will also talk about space.
3834300	3847324	B	0.7130246758460999	And the punchline of it will be that there's obviously a physics approach to emergent space time, which is very technical and so on.
3847522	3862600	B	0.8688738942146301	But from what I understood, I have yet to see the talk myself first is that there is a parallel biological approach as to how we learn out spacetime.
3862760	3875712	B	0.6509054899215698	So from developmental psychology point of you infants, and I suppose all kinds of animals are not Born fully equipped to perceive spacetime.
3875856	3879208	B	0.8559873700141907	Hence the necessity of things like play and so on.
3879294	3885784	B	0.8667179942131042	So they can find correlations between motor inputs and visual inputs, right?
3885902	3889880	B	0.8125296235084534	And eventually things like the mirror test, which is nontrivial.
3890620	3895070	B	0.5248661041259766	No human is Born passing the mirror test already.
3895840	3899832	B	0.7960617542266846	So that implies that at least biologically, it is nontrivial.
3899896	3906632	B	0.8380018472671509	And it takes a few steps until you get to have that sort of spatial awareness.
3906776	3907470	B	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3907920	3913520	B	0.7483881115913391	Now, the interesting part, at least for me personally, is what the physics side of it is.
3913670	3924950	B	0.7960581183433533	And I'm no expert by any means, but I think the gist of it might have to do something with quantum error correction adseft and so on.
3925720	3930170	B	0.813033401966095	There was a bit of a teaser about quantum error correction here in these.
3931340	3933850	B	0.765277087688446	Yeah, I mean, that's that's about all I can say.
3934460	3937130	B	0.937901496887207	But very looking forward to the biology also.
