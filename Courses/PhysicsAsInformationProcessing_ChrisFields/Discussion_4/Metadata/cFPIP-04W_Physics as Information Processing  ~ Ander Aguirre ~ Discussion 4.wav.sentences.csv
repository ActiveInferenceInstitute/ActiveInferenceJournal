8730	9390	1	A	0.95969	All right.
9540	11070	2	A	0.99993	Hello and welcome everyone.
11220	20570	3	A	0.52175	It is Saturday, August 26, 2023 and we're here in “Physics as information processing,” in the fourth discussion.
20730	21470	4	A	0.99998	Thank you everybody.
21540	23550	5	A	0.72261	Who's joining live or watching?
23620	25266	6	A	1	Live or watching in replay.
25418	28530	7	A	0.98317	This should be a really fun discussion as usual.
28690	43290	8	A	0.99138	So we're going to have Ander provide some slides and some initial clarifying questions for Chris and then we're going to open it up for our guests to ask some questions and check in a live chat, see what people are talking about.
43360	47050	9	A	0.90979	So Ander, to you for some slides and overview.
48030	48394	10	B	0.59455	Okay.
48432	49222	11	B	0.99993	Thank you, Daniel.
49286	57614	12	B	0.94865	So last time we were starting to talk about multi agent communication and lock protocols and all of that.
57732	64430	13	B	0.99989	So let's quickly go through the slides and sort of try to recall the main concepts.
66630	71170	14	B	0.99	I guess just to go back to session three for a second.
71320	81350	15	B	0.7	One takeaway was that when you have non committing sectors in a boundary, that's necessarily going to require classical communication between them.
81500	90170	16	B	0.99996	So that is more or less the whole point of today, how noncommittan sectors may communicate, have to communicate classically.
96110	108474	17	B	0.99473	Another introduction in this last lecture was this new graphical notation, TQFT, if you wish to call it that way for any of these clock ticks.
108522	134470	18	B	0.79482	Okay, so let's recall the whole process of measuring a sector environment and writing it into a memory environment can be simplified to this sort of tick that connects two portions of the boundary and everything we talk about lock protocols will be written in this graphical notation.
137550	142300	19	B	0.99874	So let's keep going a little bit.
143790	149562	20	B	0.99866	This slide is on the paper on sequential measurements from 2022.
149696	156858	21	B	0.99799	These are basically the formal mapping between QRFs and topological quantum field theories.
156954	157214	22	B	0.8066	Okay.
157252	162714	23	B	0.99981	So we're more used to the picture here on the left hand side of this slide, right with the QRF sectors.
162762	167490	24	B	0.98711	But pictorically speaking, this is at least how they map.
169110	169714	25	B	0.63531	Okay?
169832	178418	26	B	1	And then from then we started talking about entanglement and classical communications using this notation.
178514	182120	27	B	0.69	And this is probably where my questions to Chris will start.
182650	193770	28	B	0.97744	So in section Three, we saw this idea of the FEP asymptotically being the principle of unitarity, aka.
194830	216610	29	B	0.67492	Driving the system, the joint system, Alice and Bob to entanglement, which in this graphical notation, amounts to them sort of completing a cycle here where the QRFs are perfectly aligned, so that the S sector of one becomes the memory sector of the other.
216760	223490	30	B	0.99	And vice I actually at this point already, I have a question for Chris.
223830	225220	31	B	1	I have it written down.
230330	230886	32	B	0.6358	Yes.
230988	232790	33	B	1	Two things here, Chris.
233530	246826	34	B	0.99854	Number one is in the log protocol picture we do have a distinguishing between a quantum channel and a classical channel.
247008	257962	35	B	1	And if I understood that part correctly, we said that passage of time or expenditure of energy, free energy only corresponds to the classical tick.
258106	270738	36	B	0.99582	So in this quantum entanglement picture where you don't quite have that, is it fair to say that there's no such thing as a classical take no passage of time, no expenditure of free energy.
270904	282582	37	B	0.99327	Is this a degenerate picture of the locked protocol where the sectors were aligned the right way and boom, you got rid of that classical thing and that's it.
282636	295020	38	B	0.92	And secondly, I guess, what does it mean for these two parts, quote unquote from the paper, to implement a joint quantum process?
299860	311860	39	C	0.85188	So, yeah, this is not a lock protocol, clearly, because there is no classical communication.
312280	321012	40	C	0.9	And in fact, Alice is not divided into multiple compartments.
321076	328410	41	C	0.98597	Here Alice is just implementing this single quantum process, Q.
329360	376308	42	C	0.99	And because these sectors are because these QRFs are perfectly aligned, we can think of, remember from probably the second session the picture that you were very interested in under of the Wick rotation reversing time between Alice and Bob.
376484	388860	43	C	0.65748	So Alice's clock in fact ticks in the opposite direction from Bob's clock because both of their internal clocks are counting incoming bits, not outgoing.
390640	398930	44	C	0.77257	In this, in the right side of this picture, there is no overall time.
399620	410980	45	C	0.99904	You can think of Alice's clock ticking forward one unit and then Bob's clock ticking backward one unit.
411720	422388	46	C	0.99812	So that the information flow is completely time symmetric between Alice and Bob.
422564	431550	47	C	0.99435	So we can think of both of these processes, q and Q prime, as bi directional in time.
432480	435710	48	C	0.99858	That's what it means to have a pure unitary process.
438320	439784	49	B	0.99997	So no time asymmetry.
439832	440760	50	B	0.73046	That's what it is.
440850	441152	51	C	0.99994	Right.
441206	444108	52	C	0.99993	So there is no time asymmetry in this picture.
444284	450300	53	C	0.99	And when you introduce classical communication, of course you have to have a time asymmetry.
450460	450880	54	B	0.99625	Right.
450950	457700	55	C	0.99987	Because you have this I mean, classicality is defined by this notion of irreversibility.
458440	459060	56	B	0.84	I see.
459130	462656	57	C	0.99911	Which is just the same as time asymmetry.
462848	465976	58	C	0.99	And it's the irreversibility that burns energy.
466078	496970	59	C	0.97076	So there has to be energy flow between Alice and Bob to drive what is from a global point of view and only an apparent asymmetry, but from the point of view of Alice One and Alice Two as components of Alice, they're the ones who see the asymmetry.
501390	516026	60	B	0.99967	So I guess just to tie back to the question of the week rotation, once this joint process is implemented naively, one can say is this cycle going clockwise or counterclockwise?
516058	525700	61	B	0.91	And is that going to define on originally whenever these guys ended up being lined up where the weak sign was coming from?
531770	532520	62	C	0.73477	Yes.
533530	539190	63	C	0.99741	Whenever Alice sees information flowing in, Bob sees information flowing out.
539260	544810	64	C	0.99427	So their WIC rotations are going in opposite directions.
546110	546860	65	B	0.52373	Okay.
548990	551020	66	B	0.83337	Yeah, very good.
552830	585590	67	C	1	The other thing to think of in this picture, Rich, it's impossible to draw all of these simultaneously, is that if you think of the FEP as fully aligning Alice and Bob, then not only do these processes perfectly couple, but the area that's green in this right hand side kind of expands to fill the whole boundary.
586250	599480	68	C	0.99244	So that in the complete limit of Alice being able to perfectly predict Bob and vice versa, then the whole boundary is green.
600490	611870	69	C	0.78757	So there's no this distinction between the S sector and the Y sector disappears.
612930	615294	70	B	0.63504	Yes, that makes sense, actually.
615412	631138	71	B	1	And just to conclude with this slide, back in the session two, we saw something about agents requiring a free choice of reference frame for their QRFs, which amounts to being able to choose how to measure a spin.
631234	632806	72	B	0.99343	Right, right.
632908	642150	73	B	0.99501	So is part of this entanglement picture, do they just have to align the sectors or also the way they are measuring a spin on those sectors?
643790	648598	74	C	0.99915	Yes, they have to align the way they're measuring the spin in those sectors.
648774	662990	75	C	0.66127	It's that lack of remember the point that free choice of local reference frame is required for separability.
663890	677300	76	C	0.98599	So as the systems become fully entangled, then their local reference frames for each qubit become the same.
678230	680500	77	C	0.98704	Become necessarily the same.
685170	686078	78	B	0.98047	Thank you.
686244	686622	79	B	0.5856	Okay.
686676	688880	80	B	1	And then let's continue a little bit.
689250	695250	81	B	0.97673	So in this talk, we're mainly interested on QRFs that do not commute.
695990	706754	82	B	1	Now, maybe, Chris, you can tie this back to what you were saying earlier about if you're perfectly entangled, then the sector is going to grow.
706792	708166	83	B	0.99904	Does it have anything to do with this?
708188	717720	84	B	0.99887	So if Q one and Q two here do commute, then how do you reduce this to the picture on the right hand side?
718490	725130	85	B	1	At the first glance, it looks like the picture on the left hand side encompasses more sectors of the boundary.
727390	728090	86	C	0.99991	Yeah.
728240	776710	87	C	1	The point here is just that if we go back and go back to the notation where what we're representing by this simplified notation is a collection of cocon diagrams, and if these reference frames commute, then one can take these two diagrams and find a think of it in the information inflow direction.
778490	795330	88	C	0.99995	There will always be a common cocon over the two sets of input classifiers if the two QRFs commute.
796070	819534	89	C	0.99878	So what that means is that I go from a diagram with two sets of classifiers, each going up to some apex, to a diagram with the merged set of classifiers going up to some farther up the hierarchy apex because they commute.
819602	828570	90	C	0.62	I can find that sort of yet more abstract coconut that covers all of the classifiers in both QRS.
830270	839034	91	C	0.99421	So that just collapses these pairs of green segments down to one green segment.
839082	840830	92	C	1	And I've drawn it the same size.
840900	845154	93	C	0.9	I mean, it would make more sense graphically, I suppose, to draw it.
845272	845842	94	B	0.42673	Right.
845976	850740	95	C	0.99995	Each one is twice as big or twice the area.
851270	865800	96	C	0.84288	But keeping to this kind of very topological representation where the area isn't actually meaningful, it is convenient to draw it this way.
866330	866982	97	B	0.99956	Right.
867116	872810	98	B	0.81277	So in short, commutative the fact that they commute means that you will have that higher apex anyway.
872880	875670	99	B	0.99986	So you can bypass that first nesting.
875830	876202	100	C	0.82321	Right.
876256	879530	101	B	0.99896	But it comes to the number of degrees of freedom at the boundary.
879950	881098	102	B	0.99845	They're still the same.
881184	884170	103	B	0.51	And in terms of area right, okay.
884240	884630	104	C	0.98906	Yeah.
884720	891600	105	C	0.95396	We're not getting rid of any of the degrees of freedom of the boundary that these QRFs are looking at.
893170	894750	106	B	0.98736	Yeah, very good.
894820	898706	107	B	0.94311	So the next slide I found a very interesting one.
898728	912070	108	B	0.98626	So these are no Go theorems things that Alice and Bob cannot do, and it's mainly having to do about measuring their own entanglement entropy and counting degrees of freedom.
913850	922554	109	B	1	I guess this has a very holographic feel to it, and also maybe even a bit of a Goddess theorem feel to it.
922592	925420	110	B	0.9959	So I don't know if Chris wants to comment on that.
927950	951250	111	C	0.9985	Well, I'll just say that I think this does have a kind of girdle undecidability feel to it, in that there are a large number of questions that Alice can't answer, which certainly suggests a formulation in terms of incompleteness.
952310	968150	112	C	0.91	And the connection to Gertle's theorem is actually something that Jim Glazberg and I are currently working on, and hopefully we'll be able to make that connection more precise.
968730	990090	113	C	0.98874	But the point of these statements is just to emphasize that a single observer that's uncompartmentalized cannot determine anything about the entanglement entropy of the environment.
990250	999214	114	C	1	And this is just the result that to measure entanglement, you have to employ a lock protocol.
999262	1001730	115	C	0.58551	So you have to have classical communication.
1002710	1028700	116	C	1	And this raises a fundamental issue in the theory, and that classical communication is an exchange of information that cannot be represented as a single quantum process.
1029390	1051570	117	C	0.30628	Hence, you have language like the collapse of the wave function or these various other decoherence, et cetera, et cetera, these various ways of trying to capture this idea that something different and irreversible is happening as soon as you talk about classical communication.
1052950	1065030	118	C	0.84154	So the point is, for Alice to measure anything about the entanglement entropy of Bob, she has to be sectored.
1066250	1074122	119	C	0.99787	So her entanglement entropy has to decrease, but she can't know that.
1074256	1080700	120	C	0.99962	She can't actually know that she has sectored compartments when we think of Alice as an entire system.
1081470	1094030	121	C	0.96691	So from now on, we're going to be talking about the very limited points of view of particular observers.
1094870	1099218	122	C	1	And to talk about that.
1099384	1121414	123	C	1	I think it's very important to keep these various limitations in mind, because there's a real distinction between what we can say effectively from this kind of God's eye point of view that we're adopting.
1121462	1143838	124	C	0.97983	As theorists where we say Alice has sectors that are communicating classically and what Alice's system can do from her point of view or her sectors can do from their points of view.
1144004	1150420	125	C	0.99	And this is a distinction that's often ignored, but it's important to keep it in mind.
1157190	1157940	126	A	0.99996	Awesome.
1158310	1161330	127	A	0.98683	Thanks for this line ender.
1161690	1162198	128	B	0.99587	Yeah.
1162284	1164280	129	B	0.9416	So should we continue?
1165130	1188350	130	B	0.9988	Yeah, then I guess we get to the proper material of the last lecture, which is what happens when you have sectors that are commutative, such as two portions of Alice involved that have to communicate classically.
1189010	1191950	131	B	0.52012	This is what requires the classical communication tick.
1195330	1196400	132	B	0.97881	Let me see.
1197910	1211074	133	B	0.87992	So would it be fair to say, Chris, this only such a classical channel, such as the one shown in this slide requires free energy.
1211272	1212178	134	B	0.73148	Is that right?
1212264	1215750	135	B	0.90198	Because there's some writing into a memory involved in here.
1215900	1223114	136	B	0.99983	Compared to the earlier slide where we had that closed loop in the entangled picture, there was no expenditure of energy.
1223152	1223900	137	B	0.89979	Is that.
1227390	1239040	138	C	0.64	The the example to keep in mind here is exactly the process that we're executing right now.
1241570	1249730	139	C	0.71385	Alice has two components, and we are currently in the position of those components.
1250470	1260870	140	C	1	And we're communicating classically with each other by employing a channel that's part of our shared environment.
1261690	1268390	141	C	0.99965	So we are acting irreversibly on our shared environment.
1269770	1279020	142	C	1	And it's that irreversible action on the environment that has the free energy cost for each of us.
1281070	1293520	143	C	0.99999	We actually have to make noise to communicate, and our laptops are actually consuming power.
1294130	1296118	144	C	0.99999	All of this is classical.
1296314	1302850	145	C	0.97792	It's this irreversibility that defines classicality.
1304710	1305362	146	C	0.98359	Right.
1305496	1312194	147	B	0.98	And to continue with this question, I guess it will come ensure in later slides.
1312242	1315334	148	B	0.99926	But the other side of this lock protocol is the quantum channel.
1315452	1334810	149	B	0.92	And my question to you, Chris, is just like there is an expenditure of time and energy involved in this classical channel, is the quantum channel basically the opposite of that meaning its action is instantaneous entanglement, presumably.
1334970	1343680	150	B	1	And also, again, back to that loop picture of entangled cycle, is there just no passage of time, no expenditure of energy?
1344690	1346740	151	B	0.99845	Does any of that make sense?
1348150	1348610	152	C	0.9357	Yeah.
1348680	1356820	153	C	1	And I think it's worth actually going to the next slide here where we complete the loop and add the quantum channel.
1359450	1360662	154	B	0.95952	Is it this one?
1360796	1361480	155	C	0.9844	Yeah.
1364090	1394030	156	C	1	I think to understand what's going on here, I think it's very useful to think of it in terms of a Belly PR experiment, right, where Bob, in this case, the shared environment includes the source that's creating the entangled pair, which a one and a two observe simultaneously.
1394930	1403502	157	C	0.94466	They interact simultaneously with their two detectors, which are interacting with the entangled pair.
1403566	1414760	158	C	0.99878	So you can think of their two detectors are entangled, and it's only later that they exchange this classical information.
1415690	1452450	159	C	0.99	And in a Belly PR experiment, the elapsed time between the source emitting the entangled pair and the entangled pair interacting with the detectors deployed by a one and a two is designed as part of the experimental protocol to be less than the time that it is required for a one and a two to communicate classically.
1453670	1461800	160	C	1	And notice that from the point of view of the entangled pair itself, no time has passed at all.
1462330	1463080	161	C	0.97414	Right?
1463850	1474010	162	C	1	The entangled pair is, from a special relativity point of view, moving along a light like trajectory.
1474830	1481770	163	C	0.99922	So there's no distance being traversed and no time is elapsing.
1482270	1493470	164	C	1	From the point of view of the entangled pair, there's only an elapsed time and a traverse distance in the coordinates of the observers.
1495330	1503490	165	C	1	And it's those coordinates that define the parameters for the observer's eventual classical communication.
1506870	1520390	166	C	0.99919	So this is why I characterized the assumption of classical communication as a stipulation and also why I characterized it as a fine tuning assumption.
1522350	1548930	167	C	0.53522	We are assuming something very specific about this communication channel, and we're assuming that the part of Bob, the part of the shared environment that implements this classical communication channel, behaves differently from the rest of the shared environment.
1550470	1559350	168	C	0.99997	It behaves in a way that is classical, but the rest of the shared environment doesn't.
1559930	1560390	169	C	0.9962	Right.
1560460	1564550	170	C	1	The rest of the world is described using quantum theory.
1564890	1579260	171	C	0.99987	So we're making this assumption that part of the shared environment is special, and the specialness is that it behaves in this classical way.
1582270	1584666	172	B	0.99731	So let me finish with this slide.
1584698	1596850	173	B	1	I suppose to go back to my earlier question about that Entangled loop being at least Pictorically appears to be like a degenerate version of this log picture.
1597510	1616322	174	B	0.93517	If in this log picture I have the quantum channel on the right, that hypothetical entanglement to complete the cycle on the left was only broken when a one and a two chose to write that into their memories at different sectors.
1616386	1616758	175	B	0.99987	Right.
1616844	1621346	176	B	1	And then that eventually necessitated the classical communication between them.
1621468	1622460	177	B	0.99831	Is that correct?
1623630	1624380	178	C	0.99987	Yeah.
1628270	1642190	179	C	1	One could always take the point of view of, if you will, the observer who's outside the entire universe and just sees the entire universe evolving unitarily.
1643650	1649650	180	C	1	And from that point of view, there's no such thing as classical communication.
1650230	1658370	181	C	0.99984	So the communication is classical only relative to this division between the Observers.
1659610	1670310	182	C	0.95	And that division between the observers corresponds to their measurement procedures, not commuting.
1671230	1693390	183	C	0.94617	So it corresponds to what we think of classically as Alice acting on her half of the entangled state, determining what Bob will, then that all of that causal language is classical.
1694050	1694800	184	B	0.52668	Right.
1698070	1700450	185	B	0.73294	We're like at 1130.
1700520	1712200	186	B	0.99991	So halfway, more or less, let's say a few words on the later slide process and all of that.
1714410	1724774	187	B	1	I guess before we start talking about this, which will take us like five to ten minutes at most, could you say a few words again about the fine tuning assumption?
1724822	1734010	188	B	0.7101	So I still can't quite understand what is meant here, that this whole classical communication stuff requires fine tuning.
1743020	1743720	189	C	0.64516	Okay.
1743870	1758140	190	C	1	I think a way to think about it is to think about what it means to say that Alice and Bob are able to communicate classically.
1760960	1766068	191	C	0.96317	What we're saying is that Alice and Bob share some sort of language.
1766184	1773570	192	C	0.99361	So when they exchange their data, we can think of their data as written in some binary code in a data.
1775460	1784240	193	C	0.38208	Alice says, I set my instrument this way and I saw this spin.
1784820	1789596	194	C	1	I then set my instrument this other way, and I made this observation.
1789788	1802360	195	C	0.97978	So Alice, his data table, or a one's data table, is just a long table with two entries in each row.
1802940	1811180	196	C	1	One entry is how the detector was adjusted, and the other entry is what the value of the spin was observed.
1811920	1814270	197	C	0.99	And Bob's data table looks the same.
1814640	1822480	198	C	0.53	And so they share this information, or they share it with some third party, they communicate it classically.
1823220	1826780	199	C	1	And there are two aspects to that classical communication.
1826860	1841690	200	C	0.73	One is that up to classical noise, their data tables don't change when they share them.
1842380	1847610	201	C	0.97669	So they really are irreversibly recorded.
1847980	1854860	202	C	0.97419	They're not evolving in time along with the rest of the universe.
1856720	1881540	203	C	1	The other aspect is that we have to assume that Alice and Bob mean the same thing by their notations in these data tables so that they can actually compare them, so that they can actually do the statistics and see if they've violated Bell's inequality.
1882280	1909196	204	C	0.99422	So what that means is we have to assume that they actually share a definition of up, and that when they talk about changing the settings on their instruments, they're talking about changing those settings with respect to some shared definition of, you know, in a real experiment, that shared definition of up is provided by the Earth's gravitational field or something like that.
1909378	1914300	205	C	0.98568	Earth's magnetic field, some shared environmental variable.
1915940	1941540	206	C	0.4542	So now it seems like we have a situation in which Alice One and Alice Two should be entangled because they share this reference frame that enables them to communicate classically, but they can't be entangled if they're going to communicate classically.
1945500	1956220	207	C	0.87042	So we make an assumption that in just this case, they share a reference frame, but they're not entangled.
1957840	1962380	208	C	0.81633	They're able to communicate classically while sharing the reference frame.
1963040	1974450	209	C	1	And we can sort of wave our hands and say they only share the reference frame up to some measurement resolution or something like that.
1975220	1993012	210	C	0.99977	But despite the hand waving, we're making a very specific assumption that violates the fact that reference frame sharing induces entanglement.
1993156	1995800	211	C	0.98134	So that's the fine tuning assumption.
1996540	2008620	212	C	0.99999	We assume that the universe is such that in this very specific kind of case, we can have reference frame sharing without entanglement.
2013200	2013950	213	B	0.89954	Cool.
2015760	2026370	214	A	0.99945	Let's keep it here and just open it up a little bit if Haris or Dean want to just give any thought or reflection on what we've gotten to so far.
2028440	2030870	215	A	0.81261	Haris, if you want to, please.
2031880	2032724	216	D	0.99953	Yes.
2032922	2034470	217	D	0.99996	Everything is very interesting.
2035880	2041270	218	D	0.99978	Basically, I was listening with great, let's say focus.
2041660	2049608	219	D	0.99918	It reminded me this, let's say, elaboration on the previous talk that Chris gave two weeks ago.
2049774	2054350	220	D	0.99895	It reminded me something that Michael Levin said some time ago.
2055600	2061630	221	D	0.99996	It is regarding this amazing ability of cognition to scale up.
2062000	2072556	222	D	0.99989	So it's not only this understanding, let's say, of the scattering of cognition, but also the scaling up of cognition.
2072748	2091424	223	D	0.55	And when I tried to get inside my head, actually, that as Chris said in one of his talks, that if a system is a tag wall, one cannot draw a meaningful boundary across it.
2091562	2104940	224	D	0.90569	So this fine tuning, let's say elaboration that was made right now actually helps me understand that even better.
2105010	2109390	225	D	0.98648	So thank you, Chris, for that and thank you Ander for this.
2114320	2114924	226	C	0.9554	Thank you.
2114962	2115500	227	C	0.66059	Thank you.
2115570	2117040	228	C	0.99961	I'm glad that helped.
2119060	2141960	229	C	0.99985	Yeah, I think this is intimately related to the question of what cognition is since if we have a purely quantum system, there really is a deep sense in which nothing is happening because of the time symmetry.
2142620	2151000	230	C	0.99989	So to talk about cognition as something that actually occurs, we have to think of it classically.
2155440	2156344	231	D	0.99999	Thank you.
2156482	2169860	232	D	0.99952	Also, if you allow me another comment on that, basically one of the comments posted during your last talk in the chat had to do with classical memories.
2170200	2177940	233	D	1	And I was thinking about that and I came to the conclusion that classical memories presupposes a gestation period.
2178520	2183240	234	D	0.95	And when I think about it, that actually makes sense.
2183390	2189812	235	D	0.98	And it is true, let's say, for both physical and psychological reasons.
2189956	2202744	236	D	0.99721	So, for example, a hard disk needs to write data on its magnetic surface and a human brain needs to consolidate all those neural connections through synaptic plasticity.
2202792	2203580	237	D	0.9919	Let's say.
2203730	2227360	238	D	0.99999	However, when we start thinking about quantum information and quantum memories, let's say we realize that such memories will be such quantum memories basically will be stored in qubits or in those entagle states that you describe.
2227520	2231540	239	D	0.9998	So they do not necessarily have the same limitations.
2231980	2250312	240	D	0.88	And of course, quantum information theory suggests, as I understand it, that quantum memories can be created and accessed instantaneously without any form of ingestation, let's say without any ingestation period.
2250456	2268508	241	D	0.62	And of course this goes back and it has the potential, as I see, to revolutionize computation in terms of quantum computation, but also, and most importantly, communication and quantum cryptography even.
2268694	2274550	242	D	0.78	And this is something that I am truly interested in.
2275240	2279350	243	D	0.99992	So yeah, I just wanted to share also that.
2283740	2286570	244	C	0.99901	Yeah, that's a very good point.
2288540	2314960	245	C	1	And the flip side is the issue of stability which again gets to the notion of environmental decoherence which is just the process of observation of the quantum state by some environment or some observer, some component of its environment.
2316020	2330150	246	C	1	And the reason this is a problem in practice is that we don't have complete control of all components of the environment, right?
2331580	2352780	247	C	0.99903	So we have to use things like liquid helium to try to keep the environment at bay to prevent decoherence because any other components of the environment interacting with our quantum memory will alter the state of the memory.
2356660	2366160	248	D	0.99969	Yeah, that is a great answer and basically the reason why I typed that question.
2366230	2375720	249	D	0.99382	Regarding super selection rules, and namely me, I propose something called fuzzy super selection rules.
2376700	2403280	250	D	0.99991	Basically, as I understand it, those super selection rules, the classical ones, let's say they are based on symmetries or on all those conversation laws that actually limit the accessibility or our capacity to measure, let's say, certain quantum properties, let's say, maybe it's parity, maybe it's angular momentum, maybe it's even charge.
2403940	2426740	251	D	0.99994	But if we start thinking like these fuzzy super selection rules in an effort to relax these restrictions by allowing some degree of coherence or interference between the different super selected sectors, which can be quantified, let's say, by a parameter called fuzziness.
2426900	2446496	252	D	1	I know that in other fields, like in my field, that is fuzzy cognitive mapping, the introduction of fuzziness from as it was propounded by Professor Lotfield Zadek, it actually helped a lot of our models to become more accurate, let's say.
2446598	2449484	253	D	0.99982	So this is what I am proposing.
2449532	2464672	254	D	0.99817	Maybe of course, I don't expect it to revolutionize quantum information, but maybe it can help us understand a bit better what is going on and the role of the coherence that comes out of the environment.
2464736	2474650	255	D	0.99971	So if we incorporate it as a parameter of fuzziness, a priority, then maybe we can understand and even what we are dealing with.
2478510	2479260	256	C	0.91225	Yeah.
2481150	2487450	257	C	1	I would refer you to the paper by Bartlett.
2489730	2500478	258	C	0.56373	There are two other co authors in 2007, a lovely review of quantum reference frames in reviews of modern Physics.
2500654	2512950	259	C	0.57	And a point that they make that I think is relevant here is that a super selection rule can always be interpreted.
2514410	2515480	260	C	0.9999	Let me see.
2516250	2532330	261	C	0.79628	I'm not sure I'll be able to completely reproduce their argument, but they show that a super selection rule can always be interpreted as the absence of a reference frame or the lack of a reference frame.
2532750	2546270	262	C	1	And one of the examples that they give is charge conservation, that we never see superpositions of different electric charges.
2547750	2555234	263	C	1	And their point is we never see this because we have no way of measuring it.
2555272	2569030	264	C	1	We have no reference frame that we could use that would allow us to see a state of superposed charges.
2570490	2587150	265	C	1	And effectively what they're saying is our reference frames are all made of matter that is composed of stuff that has well defined electric charges.
2587570	2592906	266	C	0.99989	So we can't see things that are superpositions of charge.
2593018	2598160	267	C	0.65	And it's very difficult for us to see things that are superpositions of position.
2599910	2623658	268	C	0.99915	So this question of what is a super selection rule, why do we have these rules, at least in their reasoning, boils down to the question of why do we have some reference frames or some measurement capabilities and not others?
2623744	2632970	269	C	0.99999	What is it about us that limits in some fundamental way our ability to make measurements?
2634190	2663160	270	C	1	And I suspect that when you talk about fuzziness, which is a sense of classical uncertainty, that you may be sort of pointing in that direction, but I think it would be worth looking at that paper, which is largely written in English, right?
2663690	2667590	271	C	1	The formalism is kept in the background.
2669690	2671880	272	C	0.99133	So it's a very nice paper.
2675150	2676140	273	D	0.69886	Thank you.
2678270	2679260	274	A	0.99684	Thank you.
2679870	2680502	275	A	0.62562	Andrew.
2680566	2682010	276	A	0.96987	Maybe mute a little bit.
2682160	2687520	277	A	0.99566	Dean on the Mountaintop, what can you throw down on us?
2691910	2695778	278	E	1	I don't have anything super special throw down.
2695944	2709218	279	E	0.62	I have a question, though, and because I am very comfortable in that fuzzy space, I kind of see relationships and their lack of definability as a feature.
2709314	2712040	280	E	0.99915	So here's kind of my question.
2713450	2717594	281	E	0.99979	So you talked about a minimum sort of two different memories to encode something in time.
2717632	2726122	282	E	1	And I think it was one of the slides just after the one that's up here right now, which sounds to me like somewhere processing capacity.
2726186	2739234	283	E	0.99976	It sounds like we are kind of stepping back and trying to look at this instantaneous thing from the relative position of even the things that are classical can be seen as all.
2739432	2743940	284	E	0.98544	So that when you mentioned that earlier, Chris, that helped me quite a bit.
2744950	2749182	285	E	0.99911	Which then manifests itself as a classical ability to process somewhere.
2749326	2754390	286	E	1	I spent a lot of my career self labeling as a wayfinder.
2755210	2758200	287	E	0.94449	So not capacity realization, relationship.
2760810	2762358	288	E	0.78729	Just as a relationship.
2762524	2772746	289	E	0.99998	It means that wayfinding is not just an orienting or a processing where I am and being gripped by sort of the thing that I'm enveloped by.
2772768	2779450	290	E	0.99746	It's also the channel, the screen, the bound, the divide, the gap, the unentangled potentiator.
2779610	2784960	291	E	0.99973	It's the thing upon which traction can exist as being a gripper as well.
2787810	2799758	292	E	0.95	I was already hung up on I wanted to go back like Colombo in that old 70s TV show and talk about Z spin because I think Z spin is an energy way of describing.
2799934	2815290	293	E	0.99998	But I honestly think when I went back and watched your presentation a couple of times, I'm starting to get a sense that Z spin is also relationship it's that affordance, that allows us to be able to see up and down.
2815440	2836798	294	E	0.99823	But I'm just curious, Chris, are we really talking about processing somewhere in the classical sense, but because we have these two ways of encoding different memories, we're also talking about somewhere processing just that state that allows for that's.
2836894	2843460	295	E	0.99999	My question is that what we're really getting, are we trying to open that up, that possibility up?
2848230	2853400	296	C	0.79503	Yeah, I think that's a nice way to think about it.
2856170	2871180	297	C	1	I think we're trying to, at some deep level come up with a way of describing what it means to be an agent.
2873810	2892180	298	C	0.98	And I'll say in our case, a self conscious agent with a sense of time that's embedded in an environment that we depend on to store memories for us.
2893030	2918250	299	C	0.54	And what I mean by that is that we depend on the environment to change very slowly, at least from our point of view, so that we can keep some sense of our orientation within the environment.
2919310	2919770	300	C	0.99929	Right.
2919840	2934720	301	C	0.55997	We're using everything we see as a memory that allows us to keep ourselves fixed, which allows us to have a point of view.
2935990	2948500	302	C	0.84959	So we're using the entire visible environment as, if you will, a reference frame against which we can see small changes.
2949610	2964060	303	C	0.54686	But if the environment was constantly and rapidly changing, we wouldn't be able to do that and we wouldn't be able to use it as a memory and so we would have no point of view.
2965070	2978960	304	C	0.84064	So in a sense, I think what we're talking about here is the miracle of having a point of view that gives us a sense of time.
2984320	2985980	305	C	0.99581	That's very philosophical.
2988980	2989856	306	A	0.84528	It's amazing.
2989958	2997936	307	A	1	And I wonder if along with the perspectival visual advancements which you and.
2997958	2999564	308	A	0.49927	Shannon Dobson have explored.
2999612	3001940	309	A	0.99999	In the math art settings.
3002520	3023572	310	A	0.90785	You're almost bringing that kind of a transformative re understanding or re quantum reference framing into a temporal setting where it's not just a static spatial parallax that we are aesthetically and formally re understanding.
3023636	3048320	311	A	0.99999	But also a temporal one, which, in an agent environment system, necessitates these questions of communication, which, in the quantum information formalism, are approached topologically rather than geometrically, which is what we needed for the kind of vanishing point type math art in the spatial setting.
3050900	3059908	312	C	1	Well, I think they're approached geometrically eventually and that's really what the session in September will be about.
3060074	3084190	313	C	0.99604	It's how to start with this very topological picture where we're only talking about interactions in a sense, interactions in time, but outside of space and layer a spatial structure on top of that.
3085360	3115690	314	C	0.99	And I think this is particularly interesting in this active inference context because it immediately raises biological questions about the ability of different organisms to layer space on their experience and hence locate themselves, if you will, within some sort of perceived world.
3120060	3120664	315	A	0.99993	Awesome.
3120782	3124170	316	A	0.84383	Dean and then back to Ander for the last minutes.
3129180	3130056	317	A	0.47	Oh, wait, unmute.
3130088	3131710	318	A	0.97649	Dean and then please continue.
3133440	3134190	319	E	0.98445	Sorry.
3134640	3154790	320	E	0.9911	So, Chris, is it from the pure neophyte perspective that I have, is it OK to say that it's not just a flipping of position of words, that somewhere processing, that availability and processing somewhere in the classical sense, where am I?
3155160	3164630	321	E	0.94999	It's our ability to fuse those, as you mentioned, we can slow down, we can stabilize, we can see that relationship.
3165100	3175050	322	E	0.98787	Or is it about spinning?
3179230	3182140	323	C	0.91	I think the former, right.
3182610	3190350	324	C	0.99788	Spin is a very convenient abstraction for talking about binary encoding.
3193840	3203324	325	C	1	And we have this felt sense of spin, but its use in physics is very much an abstraction.
3203452	3207840	326	C	0.98	I mean, the difference between a proton and neutron is a spin variable.
3212810	3213560	327	A	0.97243	Awesome.
3214170	3224360	328	A	0.50895	Ander you can in the last minutes take it where you need also unmute and then continue.
3226110	3227660	329	B	0.99984	Can you guys hear me now?
3228430	3232714	330	B	0.94532	So let's hope that I have time for Chris to address a couple of things.
3232832	3239690	331	B	0.99399	So just to conclude the slides and then hopefully we get to say a few words on quantum Darwinism.
3239850	3248640	332	B	0.99678	So towards the end, the slides appear to start pivoting towards the next subject, which is space and time.
3249030	3264870	333	B	0.98	And here in particular, we see the earlier slide showcasing the Lock protocol where you can notice that half of it has been cut and has been moved to the future.
3264940	3270840	334	B	0.99624	So here we don't have two sectors of Alice communicating, but rather Alice communicating with its future.
3271450	3274098	335	B	0.99764	Still, you have the classical and the quantum channel.
3274284	3289520	336	B	0.99	Now, one question that I brought up, I remember and in the lecture, and maybe we can expand on a little more, was exactly what is the difference between this quantum and the classical channel part?
3290450	3295610	337	B	0.99916	Something I heard Chris say is that it is crucial for the quantum channel to be recohered.
3295690	3305060	338	B	0.99805	So this is going to be some sort of unitary scattering evolution that is completely independent of everything else going on.
3305750	3307938	339	B	0.99766	Is that correct or should be?
3307944	3308770	340	B	0.9998	In theory.
3313120	3313870	341	C	0.99415	Yes.
3315540	3324988	342	B	0.99	And I suppose, just like earlier, the classical channel is the part that takes time and free energy expenditure.
3325164	3340490	343	B	0.99	Now, my question to you, Chris, is not the channels in the middle, but the ticks on either side of the boundaries that have been broken down and separated in terms of an external time.
3341180	3344964	344	B	0.95521	What's up with those ticks from one sector to the other of the boundary?
3345092	3352984	345	B	0.99972	So in Q one, for example, the lower TRF sector, that's that amount to a state was prepared.
3353112	3357004	346	B	1	The upper one was I made a memory record of that state.
3357122	3358670	347	B	0.91527	That's what it is, right?
3359680	3360430	348	C	0.50514	Yeah.
3360800	3370610	349	B	0.69025	Okay, so in the lower sector, we both had a preparation and a measurement, and a measurement was recorded classically here.
3371540	3372850	350	B	0.72883	That's all there is.
3374020	3374816	351	C	0.61332	Yeah.
3374998	3379750	352	C	0.73708	So preparation and measurement are effectively the same process.
3381960	3409890	353	C	1	And you can think of in a one of T, what a one is doing is, from an operational point of view, she's preparing an instrument and turning it on.
3410820	3443260	354	C	0.93963	She's creating an initial state, and she's simultaneously encoding a memory someplace in her head or on a piece of paper of what those preparation conditions were, because it's only with respect to the memory of what the preparation conditions were that the later measurement is meaningful.
3448560	3451980	355	C	0.9999	Let's go back to just preparing a spin.
3453780	3454624	356	C	0.98196	Right.
3454822	3468420	357	C	0.82	At T, she may set the angle of some polarization filter that defines a propagating beam of photons.
3469320	3475812	358	C	0.72	And at T plus delta T, she measures something about what those photons are doing.
3475946	3487210	359	C	0.62344	But the measurement is only meaningful with respect to her memory of what the polarization setting that prepared the photons was.
3489260	3512720	360	C	0.58939	So effectively, what's going on in the quantum channel is an experiment, and it's the classical information that's preserved in this classical channel that makes the experiment meaningful or interpretable or informative.
3513060	3514320	361	B	0.99739	Yeah, for sure.
3514470	3517904	362	B	0.98724	Yeah, that makes perfect sense in preparation of measurement.
3517952	3532630	363	B	0.99994	This ties back to an earlier question we had both happen simultaneously at the same degree of freedom at the boundary, or do we have preparation at the lower bound measurement at the top of one?
3536140	3548424	364	C	0.99182	Yeah, one can think of that operator, Mi, if you remember the decomposition of the Hamiltonian as preparing or measuring.
3548552	3553144	365	C	0.7725	It's just a matter of interpretation effectively.
3553192	3556050	366	C	0.75047	Is it acting to the left or acting to the right?
3558260	3558912	367	B	0.8816	Yeah.
3559046	3559344	368	B	0.99823	Okay.
3559382	3559968	369	B	0.86655	Yeah.
3560134	3561072	370	B	0.97945	Makes perfect.
3561206	3572230	371	B	0.89	And then before we get to quantum error correction as more of a special instead of a time thing, I wanted to ask about yet another question between this one.
3573400	3588170	372	B	0.99963	So the quantum channels does involve some sort of time evolutionary portion, that is, this portion that is evolving unitarily with no interference from the outside.
3589100	3603640	373	B	1	However, as you said, for this experiment to make sense, you need to have a classical memory of how that experiment was prepared so that means that that classical guy on top is static.
3603720	3605470	374	B	0.39943	There's no time flow in it.
3607140	3617030	375	C	0.99943	Well, this actually gets back to the talk by Suskin that we were talking about before we started here that you kindly referred me to.
3620360	3631800	376	C	0.64024	Part of this classical memory is memory for what counts as a classical clock.
3632620	3636516	377	C	1	And we'll actually get to this again in the September session.
3636708	3662400	378	C	0.99995	But if you think again about doing an experiment in which a state is prepared and then it's measured, this quantum process is a process through time with respect to some classical clock that actually provides the time coordinate for the experiment.
3663700	3683620	379	C	0.99957	So this classical clock is some external reference frame that a one here in this notation is using as part of her classical memory.
3685480	3685904	380	B	0.53639	Right.
3685962	3692090	381	C	0.99992	Again, it's a memory because it's something that's assumed not to change.
3695600	3710130	382	C	0.99997	This will be kind of the heart of the discussion in September that time and memory and object persistence are all different names for this same assumption that we make about the world.
3717160	3718420	383	A	0.94588	Thank you, Chris.
3719000	3719796	384	B	0.99835	Thank you.
3719898	3722310	385	C	1	I am going to have to so.
3723480	3725110	386	A	0.99973	Only for now though.
3725800	3727510	387	C	0.99663	Yeah, only for now.
3728220	3730760	388	C	0.99	I will nonetheless persist someplace.
3731820	3734660	389	B	0.99914	Thank you, Chris, so much, Chris.
3734820	3736410	390	C	0.62468	Okay, awesome.
3737100	3737816	391	C	0.68937	See you.
3737918	3739050	392	C	0.99693	Thanks very much.
3739580	3740890	393	A	0.99545	Measure you later.
3745500	3761490	394	A	0.15049	Andrew, if you wanted to drop any other cues or clues or bring us a little bit of a preparation for where we're going to be heading in lecture five, that would be pretty cool.
3763300	3763712	395	B	0.9994	Sure.
3763766	3768150	396	B	0.66888	So, I mean, I'm a little aware of what's coming in lecture five.
3769560	3786244	397	B	0.6428	It's about space and time and how space may be sorry, time may be a little more fundamental than space for reasons that Chris will show has a lot to do with the notion of how you define a clock.
3786372	3796696	398	B	0.67697	As in we need to think hard about what are the bare minimum ingredients for you to talk about the existence of a clock.
3796888	3801528	399	B	0.99921	These are deep, fundamental, almost philosophical questions that are overlooked.
3801704	3815004	400	B	0.99	And the good news, and that's the Saskin talk that Chris and I were referring to is that other people, especially in the high energy community, are also looking into these questions, which is very reassuring.
3815052	3830570	401	B	0.9828	So I'm talking at Wheaton, Suskin, Harlow, Et are there is a recent talk on YouTube where they talk about what does it mean for something to be a does, how long does a clock last?
3830940	3833770	402	B	0.94	And then Chris will also talk about space.
3834300	3847324	403	B	0.99	And the punchline of it will be that there's obviously a physics approach to emergent space time, which is very technical and so on.
3847522	3862600	404	B	0.99997	But from what I understood, I have yet to see the talk myself first is that there is a parallel biological approach as to how we learn out spacetime.
3862760	3875712	405	B	0.99997	So from developmental psychology point of you infants, and I suppose all kinds of animals are not Born fully equipped to perceive spacetime.
3875856	3879208	406	B	0.61169	Hence the necessity of things like play and so on.
3879294	3885784	407	B	0.99966	So they can find correlations between motor inputs and visual inputs, right?
3885902	3889880	408	B	1	And eventually things like the mirror test, which is nontrivial.
3890620	3895070	409	B	0.99996	No human is Born passing the mirror test already.
3895840	3899832	410	B	0.99995	So that implies that at least biologically, it is nontrivial.
3899896	3906632	411	B	1	And it takes a few steps until you get to have that sort of spatial awareness.
3906776	3907470	412	B	0.99949	Right?
3907920	3913520	413	B	1	Now, the interesting part, at least for me personally, is what the physics side of it is.
3913670	3924950	414	B	0.95	And I'm no expert by any means, but I think the gist of it might have to do something with quantum error correction adseft and so on.
3925720	3930170	415	B	0.9999	There was a bit of a teaser about quantum error correction here in these.
3931340	3933850	416	B	0.65655	Yeah, I mean, that's that's about all I can say.
3934460	3937130	417	B	0.99876	But very looking forward to the biology also.
3937900	3939304	418	A	0.99911	Yeah, cool.
3939502	3944670	419	A	0.98755	Haris any last thoughts or anything you want to point towards?
3946000	3950028	420	D	0.99933	Basically, I would like to thank everyone for inviting me.
3950194	3956140	421	D	0.68	I really enjoyed it the whole Livestream.
3956740	3969670	422	D	1	I hope we have made some progress and looking forward to the next live streams number five and number six.
3970840	3973220	423	D	0.98806	So that's about it.
3973290	3974230	424	D	0.99975	Thank you, everyone.
3974760	3975750	425	A	0.99985	Thank you.
3976280	3977044	426	A	0.99979	Anything else?
3977082	3979396	427	B	0.94545	Andrew that's it.
3979498	3979860	428	A	0.99982	Awesome.
3979930	3991468	429	A	0.84353	Well, I encourage everyone to go to the syllabus page, look ahead, look back, prejust digest, regest, ask questions and end.
3991634	3994504	430	A	0.99981	Let's make progress as you exhort.
3994552	3996956	431	A	0.57561	Haris so, see you all.
3997058	3997850	432	A	0.35206	Till next time.
