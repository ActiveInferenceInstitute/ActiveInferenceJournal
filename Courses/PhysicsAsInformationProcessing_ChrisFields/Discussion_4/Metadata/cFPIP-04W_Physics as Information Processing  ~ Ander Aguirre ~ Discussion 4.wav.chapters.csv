8730	49222	00:08	It is Saturday, August 26, 2023 and we're here in Physics as information processing in the fourth discussion. Who's joining live or watching? Live or watching in replay. This should be a really fun discussion as usual.	Information processing in the fourth discussion is scheduled for August 26, 2023

Another introduction in this last lecture was this new graphical notation, TQFT. Everything we talk about lock protocols will be written in this graphical notation.	When you have non committing sectors in a boundary, that requires classical communication	Quantum field theory and entanglement
178514	615294	02:58	In the log protocol picture we do have a distinguishing between a quantum channel and a classical channel. Here Alice is just implementing this single quantum process, Q. Information flow is completely time symmetric between Alice and Bob. Once this joint process is implemented naively, one can say this cycle going clockwise or counterclockwise.	In section Three, we saw this idea of the FEP asymptotically	Quantum entanglement 1
615412	686078	10:15	Agents require a free choice of reference frame for their QRFs. As the systems become fully entangled, then their local reference frames for each qubit become the same.	Agents require a free choice of reference frame for their QRFs	Quantum separation with free choice of reference frame
686244	894750	11:26	If Q one and Q two here do commute, then how do you reduce this to the picture on the right hand side? There will always be a common cocon over the two sets of input classifiers if the two QRFs commute. The number of degrees of freedom at the boundary are still the same.	If Q one and Q two here do commute, then how do you reduce	QRFs that commute and do not
894820	1150420	14:54	For Alice to measure anything about the entanglement entropy of Bob, she has to be sectored. This raises a fundamental issue in the theory, and that classical communication is an exchange of information. From now on, we're going to be talking about the very limited points of view of particular observers.	Alice and Bob cannot measure their own entanglement entropy, theorem shows	No Go Theorem for Quantum Communication
1157190	1579260	19:17	Two portions of Alice involved that have to communicate classically. This is what requires the classical communication tick. But the other side of this lock protocol is the quantum channel. Is there just no passage of time, no expenditure of energy?	Chris: Only such a classical channel requires free energy, right	Quantum communication with a classical channel
1582270	1712200	26:22	Entangled loop appears to be like a degenerate version of this log picture. Communication is classical only relative to this division between the Observers. That division corresponds to their measurement procedures, not commuting.	So the communication is classical only relative to this division between the Observers	The Entangled Loop and its classical communication
1714410	2156344	28:34	Chris: What we're saying is that Alice and Bob are able to communicate classically. We make an assumption that in just this case, they share a reference frame, but they're not entangled. Let's keep it here and just open it up a little bit if Harris or Dean want to just give any thought or reflection.	This whole classical communication stuff requires fine tuning, Ander says	The fine tuning assumption for classical communication
2156482	2366160	35:56	 quantum information theory suggests that quantum memories can be created and accessed instantaneously without any form of ingestation. This has the potential to revolutionize computation in terms of quantum computation, but also, and most importantly, communication and quantum cryptography even.	One of the comments posted during your last talk had to do with classical memories	Qubits and their memories
2366230	2695778	39:26	Dean Baker proposes something called fuzzy super selection rules. They would allow some degree of coherence or interference between the different super selected sectors. He doesn't expect it to revolutionize quantum information, but maybe it can help us understand what is going on.	I propose something called fuzzy super selection rules for quantum information	Super Selection Rules with fuzzy fuzziness
2695944	3115690	44:55	Chris Anderson: Are we really talking about processing somewhere in the classical sense, or are we also talking about somewhere processing just that state that allows for that's. In a sense, I think what we're talking about here is the miracle of having a point of view that gives us a sense of time.	You talked about having two different memories to encode something in time	Quantum information and the way of sensing places
3120060	3239690	52:00	Dean: Spin is a convenient abstraction for talking about binary encoding. Ander you can in the last minutes take it where you need also unmute and then continue. So just to conclude the slides and then hopefully we get to say a few words on quantum Darwinism.	Dean: Spin is a convenient abstraction for talking about binary encoding	Quantum Darwinism in the Last Minutes
3239850	3561072	53:59	Q: What is the difference between this quantum and the classical channel part? A: What's going on in the quantum channel is an experiment, and it's the classical information that's preserved in this classical channel that makes the experiment meaningful or interpretable or informative.	You have the classical and the quantum channel. Now, one question that I brought up, I remember	Quantum and the classical channel
3561206	3740890	59:21	For this experiment to make sense, you need to have a classical memory of how that experiment was prepared. Part of this classical memory is memory for what counts as a classical clock. And we'll actually get to this again in the September session.	So the quantum channels does involve some sort of time evolutionary portion	Quantum error correction as a time thing
3745500	3939304	1:02:25	In lecture five, Chris will talk about space and time. From what I understood, there is a parallel biological approach as to how we learn out spacetime. These are deep, fundamental, almost philosophical questions that are overlooked.	Andrew: Lecture five is about space and time	Pre-lecture 5: Space and Time
3939502	3979396	1:05:39	Harris any last thoughts or anything you want to point towards? Basically, I would like to thank everyone for inviting me. I hope we have made some progress and looking forward to the next live streams number five and number six.	Andrew Harris: I really enjoyed the whole Livestream	Livestream 4
3979498	3997850	1:06:19	Awesome. Well, I encourage everyone to go to the syllabus page, look ahead, look back, prejust digest, regest, ask questions and end. Let's make progress as you exhort. Till next time.	I encourage everyone to go to the syllabus page, look ahead, look back	SLCA 2017-4
