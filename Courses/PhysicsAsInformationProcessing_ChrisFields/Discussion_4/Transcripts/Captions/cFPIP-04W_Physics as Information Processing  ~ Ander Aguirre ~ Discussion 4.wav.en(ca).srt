1
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,070
All right. Hello and welcome everyone.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,774
It is Saturday, August 26, 2023 and

3
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:18,046
we're here in Physics as information

4
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:20,570
processing in the fourth discussion.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,590
Thank you, everybody who's joining live

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,266
or watching... Live or watching in replay.

7
00:00:25,418 --> 00:00:27,442
This should be a really fun discussion

8
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:30,306
as usual. So we're going to have Ander

9
00:00:30,418 --> 00:00:33,202
provide some slides and some initial

10
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,846
clarifying questions for Chris and then

11
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:38,654
we're going to open it up for our guests

12
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:41,018
to ask some questions and check in a

13
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,922
live chat, see what people are talking

14
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:46,022
about. So Ander, to you for some slides

15
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:49,222
and overview. Okay. Thank you, Daniel.

16
00:00:49,286 --> 00:00:53,162
So last time we were starting to talk

17
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:56,154
about multi agent communication and lock

18
00:00:56,202 --> 00:00:58,314
protocols and all of that. So let's

19
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:02,238
quickly go through the slides and sort

20
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:04,430
of try to recall the main concepts.

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,274
I guess just to go back to session three

22
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:13,426
for a second. One takeaway was that when

23
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,558
you have non committing sectors in a

24
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:17,686
boundary, that's necessarily going to

25
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,742
require classical communication between

26
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:23,846
them. So that is more or less the whole

27
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:27,454
point of today, how noncommittan sectors

28
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:29,334
may communicate, have to communicate

29
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:30,170
classically.

30
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,274
Another introduction in this last

31
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:43,466
lecture was this new graphical notation,

32
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:46,686
TQFT, if you wish to call it that way

33
00:01:46,788 --> 00:01:49,246
for any of these clock ticks. Okay, so

34
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:52,640
let's recall the whole process of

35
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,514
measuring a sector environment and

36
00:01:56,552 --> 00:01:59,186
writing it into a memory environment can

37
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:03,140
be simplified to this sort of tick that

38
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,274
connects two portions of the boundary

39
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:10,262
and everything we talk about

40
00:02:10,316 --> 00:02:13,078
lock protocols will be written in this

41
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:14,470
graphical notation.

42
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,114
So let's keep

43
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:24,566
going a little bit. This slide

44
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:26,854
is on the paper on sequential

45
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:30,154
measurements from 2022. These are

46
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,574
basically the formal mapping between

47
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:36,106
QRFs and topological quantum

48
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:38,734
field theories. Okay. So we're more used

49
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:40,318
to the picture here on the left hand

50
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:42,314
side of this slide, right with the QRF

51
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,842
sectors. But Pictorically speaking,

52
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:47,490
this is at least how they map.

53
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,554
Okay? And then from then we

54
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:55,366
started talking about entanglement and

55
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:57,894
classical communications using this

56
00:02:57,932 --> 00:03:00,006
notation. And this is probably where my

57
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:03,254
questions to Chris will start. So in

58
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:07,174
section Three, we saw this

59
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:11,034
idea of the FEP asymptotically being

60
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:13,770
the principle of unitarity, aka.

61
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,962
Driving the system, the joint system,

62
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:21,166
Alice and Bob to entanglement, which in

63
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:24,222
this graphical notation, amounts to them

64
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:27,966
sort of completing a

65
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:31,466
cycle here where the QRFs are perfectly

66
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:34,258
aligned, so that the S sector of one

67
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:36,610
becomes the memory sector of the other.

68
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,274
And vice I actually at this point

69
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:44,098
already, I have a question for Chris. I

70
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:45,220
have it written down.

71
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,790
Yes. Two things here, Chris.

72
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:59,658
Number one is in

73
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:02,234
the log protocol picture we do have a

74
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:05,258
distinguishing between a quantum channel

75
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:08,330
and a classical channel. And if I

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,574
understood that part correctly, we said

77
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:13,614
that passage of time or expenditure of

78
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,686
energy, free energy only corresponds to

79
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:21,082
the classical tick. So in this quantum

80
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:23,258
entanglement picture where you don't

81
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:25,154
quite have that, is it fair to say that

82
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:27,454
there's no such thing as a classical

83
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:29,646
take no passage of time, no expenditure

84
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:32,430
of free energy. Is this a degenerate

85
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,278
picture of the locked protocol where the

86
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:38,038
sectors were aligned the right way and

87
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:39,842
boom, you got rid of that classical

88
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:43,526
thing and that's it. And secondly, I

89
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:46,342
guess, what does it mean for these two

90
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:49,850
parts, quote unquote from the paper,

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,862
to implement a joint

92
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,020
quantum process?

93
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,904
So, yeah, this is not a lock

94
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:07,924
protocol, clearly, because there

95
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:11,860
is no classical communication.

96
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,552
And in fact, Alice is

97
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:20,100
not divided into multiple

98
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,832
compartments. Here Alice is just

99
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:27,204
implementing this single quantum

100
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:35,276
process, Q. And because

101
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:39,612
these sectors are because these QRFs are

102
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,180
perfectly aligned,

103
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,410
we can think of,

104
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,604
remember from

105
00:05:53,802 --> 00:06:00,070
probably the second session the

106
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,190
picture that you were very interested in

107
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,272
under of

108
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:13,080
the Wick rotation reversing

109
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,308
time between Alice and Bob.

110
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:20,216
So Alice's clock in fact ticks

111
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:22,376
in the opposite direction from Bob's

112
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:25,016
clock because both of their internal

113
00:06:25,048 --> 00:06:27,788
clocks are counting incoming bits, not

114
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:28,860
outgoing.

115
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,672
In this, in the right side of this

116
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,520
picture,

117
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,930
there is no overall time.

118
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,688
You can think of Alice's clock ticking

119
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:48,176
forward one unit and then Bob's

120
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,980
clock ticking backward one unit.

121
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,616
So that the

122
00:06:56,718 --> 00:06:59,912
information flow is completely time

123
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:03,096
symmetric between Alice and Bob. So we

124
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:06,360
can think of both of these processes,

125
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,584
q and Q prime, as bi directional

126
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:13,948
in time. That's what it means to have a

127
00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:15,710
pure unitary process.

128
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,760
So no time asymmetry. That's what it is.

129
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,136
Right. So there is no time asymmetry in

130
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:26,476
this picture. And when you introduce

131
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,144
classical communication, of course you

132
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:30,880
have to have a time asymmetry. Right.

133
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,604
Because you have this I mean,

134
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:36,096
classicality is defined by this notion

135
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:39,844
of irreversibility. I see. Which is just

136
00:07:39,882 --> 00:07:43,456
the same as time asymmetry. And it's

137
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:45,976
the irreversibility that burns energy.

138
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:49,412
So there has to be energy flow

139
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:53,752
between Alice and Bob to

140
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,874
drive what

141
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:02,646
is from a global point of view and

142
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:06,182
only an apparent asymmetry, but from the

143
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,942
point of view of Alice One and Alice Two

144
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:12,070
as components of Alice,

145
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,970
they're the ones who see the asymmetry.

146
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,926
So I guess just to tie back to the

147
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:27,822
question of the week rotation, once this

148
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:31,306
joint process is implemented naively,

149
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:34,446
one can say is this cycle going

150
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,706
clockwise or counterclockwise? And is

151
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:39,950
that going to define on originally

152
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,766
whenever these guys ended up being lined

153
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:45,700
up where the weak sign was coming from?

154
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,894
Yes. Whenever Alice sees information

155
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:58,834
flowing in, Bob sees information flowing

156
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:01,958
out. So their

157
00:09:02,044 --> 00:09:03,974
WIC rotations are going in opposite

158
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:06,860
directions. Okay.

159
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,020
Yeah, very good.

160
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,874
The other thing to think of in this

161
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:17,086
picture, Rich, it's impossible to draw

162
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:21,486
all of these simultaneously, is that if

163
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:26,058
you think of the FEP as fully

164
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:30,242
aligning Alice and Bob, then not

165
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:33,230
only do these processes perfectly

166
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,122
couple, but the

167
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,222
area that's green in this right

168
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:44,406
hand side kind of expands to fill the

169
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:48,166
whole boundary. So that in

170
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:53,122
the complete limit of Alice

171
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:55,654
being able to perfectly predict Bob and

172
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:58,822
vice versa, then the whole boundary is

173
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:03,394
green. So there's

174
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:08,702
no this distinction between the

175
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:11,870
S sector and the Y sector disappears.

176
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,838
Yes, that makes sense, actually. And

177
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:19,134
just to conclude with this slide, back

178
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:20,722
in the session two, we saw something

179
00:10:20,776 --> 00:10:23,954
about agents requiring a free choice of

180
00:10:23,992 --> 00:10:26,882
reference frame for their QRFs, which

181
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:30,146
amounts to being able to choose how to

182
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:33,782
measure a spin. Right, right. So is

183
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,806
part of this entanglement picture, do

184
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:38,806
they just have to align the sectors or

185
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:41,106
also the way they are measuring a spin

186
00:10:41,138 --> 00:10:42,150
on those sectors?

187
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,758
Yes, they have to align the way they're

188
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:48,598
measuring the spin in those sectors.

189
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:52,122
It's that lack of remember the point

190
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:55,594
that free choice

191
00:10:55,642 --> 00:10:59,470
of local reference frame

192
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,438
is required for separability. So as

193
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:09,010
the systems become fully entangled,

194
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,634
then their local reference frames for

195
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:17,300
each qubit become the same.

196
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,500
Become necessarily the same.

197
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,902
Thank you. Okay. And then let's continue

198
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:31,386
a little bit. So in this talk, we're

199
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:34,474
mainly interested on QRFs that do not

200
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:36,980
commute. Now, maybe,

201
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,578
Chris, you can tie this back to what you

202
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:43,918
were saying earlier about if you're

203
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:46,386
perfectly entangled, then the sector is

204
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:47,746
going to grow. Does it have anything to

205
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:50,280
do with this? So if Q one and Q two here

206
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,446
do commute, then how do you reduce this

207
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:57,720
to the picture on the right hand side?

208
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,842
At the first glance, it looks like the

209
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:02,218
picture on the left hand side

210
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,346
encompasses more sectors of the

211
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:05,130
boundary.

212
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,574
Yeah. The point here is just that if

213
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:16,206
we go back and go

214
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:21,120
back to the notation where what

215
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,422
we're representing by this simplified

216
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:28,020
notation is a

217
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,790
collection of cocon

218
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:40,230
diagrams, and if

219
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,710
these reference frames commute,

220
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,510
then one can take these two diagrams

221
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:53,446
and find a think

222
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:55,794
of it in the information inflow

223
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:59,430
direction. There will always

224
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,670
be a common cocon

225
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,314
over the two sets of input

226
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:14,566
classifiers if the two QRFs

227
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:18,322
commute. So what that means is

228
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:21,806
that I go from a diagram with two sets

229
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:25,090
of classifiers, each going up to some

230
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,406
apex, to a

231
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:31,174
diagram with the merged set of

232
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:34,950
classifiers going up to some

233
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,822
farther up the hierarchy apex because

234
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:42,586
they commute. I can find that sort

235
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:45,894
of yet more abstract coconut that covers

236
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:48,570
all of the classifiers in both QRS.

237
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:55,550
So that just collapses these

238
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,142
pairs of green segments down to one

239
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:00,174
green segment. And I've drawn it the

240
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,654
same size. I mean, it would make more

241
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:04,674
sense graphically, I suppose, to draw

242
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:08,420
it. Right. Each one is twice as big or

243
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,410
twice the area. But keeping to

244
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,630
this kind of very topological

245
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,642
representation where the area isn't

246
00:14:18,706 --> 00:14:20,150
actually meaningful,

247
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,800
it is convenient to draw it this way.

248
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,494
Right. So in short, commutative the fact

249
00:14:29,532 --> 00:14:31,254
that they commute means that you will

250
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:33,386
have that higher apex anyway. So you can

251
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:36,666
bypass that first nesting. Right. But it

252
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:38,106
comes to the number of degrees of

253
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,554
freedom at the boundary. They're still

254
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:43,834
the same. And in terms of area right,

255
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:45,966
okay. Yeah. We're not getting rid of any

256
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:47,758
of the degrees of freedom of the

257
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:51,600
boundary that these QRFs are looking at.

258
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,474
Yeah, very good. So the next slide I

259
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:59,026
found a very interesting one. So these

260
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:02,658
are no Go theorems things that Alice and

261
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:06,034
Bob cannot do, and it's mainly having

262
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,194
to do about measuring their own

263
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:10,786
entanglement entropy and counting

264
00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:14,758
degrees of freedom. I guess

265
00:15:14,924 --> 00:15:18,086
this has a very holographic feel to

266
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:20,726
it, and also maybe even a bit of a

267
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:23,238
Goddess theorem feel to it. So I don't

268
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:25,420
know if Chris wants to comment on that.

269
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,082
Well, I'll just say that I think this

270
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:35,958
does have a kind of girdle

271
00:15:36,054 --> 00:15:39,454
undecidability feel to it, in that

272
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,646
there are a large number of questions

273
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:43,920
that Alice can't answer,

274
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,334
which certainly suggests

275
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,954
a formulation in terms of

276
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,250
incompleteness.

277
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,318
And the connection

278
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:57,810
to Gertle's theorem is actually

279
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,294
something that Jim Glazberg and I are

280
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:01,800
currently working on,

281
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,502
and hopefully we'll be able to make that

282
00:16:06,556 --> 00:16:09,994
connection more precise. But the point

283
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:12,726
of these statements is just to emphasize

284
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:17,514
that a

285
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:20,742
single observer that's

286
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:25,070
uncompartmentalized cannot

287
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,694
determine anything about the

288
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:30,090
entanglement entropy of the environment.

289
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,506
And this is just the result that to

290
00:16:34,548 --> 00:16:37,826
measure entanglement, you have

291
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:39,826
to employ a lock protocol. So you have

292
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:41,730
to have classical communication.

293
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,670
And this raises

294
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,842
a fundamental issue in the theory,

295
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:55,890
and that classical

296
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,786
communication is an exchange of

297
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:03,802
information that cannot be

298
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,990
represented as a single quantum

299
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,250
process. Hence,

300
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,286
you have language like the collapse of

301
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:16,640
the wave function or these various other

302
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,914
decoherence, et cetera, et cetera,

303
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:21,914
these various ways of trying to capture

304
00:17:21,962 --> 00:17:25,682
this idea that something different and

305
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:29,394
irreversible is happening as soon as you

306
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:31,570
talk about classical communication.

307
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,654
So the

308
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:40,262
point is, for Alice to measure anything

309
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:42,626
about the entanglement entropy of Bob,

310
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:45,030
she has to be sectored.

311
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,234
So her entanglement entropy has

312
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:54,122
to decrease, but she can't know that.

313
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,762
She can't actually know that she has

314
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,746
sectored compartments when we think of

315
00:17:58,768 --> 00:18:02,926
Alice as an entire system. So from

316
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:06,062
now on, we're going to be

317
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:09,534
talking about the

318
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:12,302
very limited points of view of

319
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:14,030
particular observers.

320
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,218
And to talk about that.

321
00:18:19,384 --> 00:18:22,274
I think it's very important to keep

322
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,980
these various limitations in mind,

323
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,762
because there's a real distinction

324
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:33,560
between what we can say

325
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,262
effectively from this

326
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,746
kind of God's eye point of view that

327
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:42,954
we're adopting. As theorists where we

328
00:18:42,992 --> 00:18:47,494
say Alice has sectors

329
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:51,340
that are communicating classically and

330
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,654
what Alice's system can do from

331
00:18:56,692 --> 00:19:00,958
her point of view or her

332
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:03,246
sectors can do from their points of

333
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:06,318
view. And this is a distinction that's

334
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:09,298
often ignored, but it's important to

335
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:10,420
keep it in mind.

336
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,330
Awesome. Thanks for this line ender.

337
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,280
Yeah. So should we continue?

338
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:25,880
Yeah,

339
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,882
then I guess we get to the proper

340
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:36,506
material of the last lecture, which is

341
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:39,402
what happens when you have sectors that

342
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:42,794
are commutative, such as two

343
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:46,240
portions of Alice involved that have to

344
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,646
communicate classically. This is what

345
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:51,194
requires the classical communication

346
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:51,950
tick.

347
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,394
Let me see. So would

348
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:02,850
it be fair to say, Chris, this only

349
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,978
such a classical channel, such as the

350
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:09,650
one shown in this slide requires

351
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,562
free energy. Is that right? Because

352
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:14,554
there's some writing into a memory

353
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:16,646
involved in here. Compared to the

354
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:18,706
earlier slide where we had that closed

355
00:20:18,738 --> 00:20:21,802
loop in the entangled picture, there was

356
00:20:21,856 --> 00:20:23,900
no expenditure of energy. Is that.

357
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,602
The the example to keep

358
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:35,630
in mind here is exactly

359
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,414
the process that we're executing right

360
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:39,040
now.

361
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,030
Alice has two components,

362
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,386
and we are currently in the position of

363
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:51,166
those components. And we're

364
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:53,234
communicating classically with each

365
00:20:53,272 --> 00:20:57,310
other by employing

366
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,954
a channel that's part of our shared

367
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:03,750
environment. So we are acting

368
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,390
irreversibly on our shared environment.

369
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:14,038
And it's that irreversible

370
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:16,394
action on the environment that has the

371
00:21:16,432 --> 00:21:19,020
free energy cost for each of us.

372
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,830
We actually have to make noise to

373
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:30,174
communicate, and our

374
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:33,520
laptops are actually consuming power.

375
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,380
All of this is classical. It's this

376
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,090
irreversibility that defines

377
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,850
classicality.

378
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,314
Right. And to continue with this

379
00:21:47,352 --> 00:21:50,370
question, I guess it will come

380
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,774
ensure in later slides. But the other

381
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,438
side of this lock protocol is the

382
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:57,638
quantum channel. And my question to you,

383
00:21:57,804 --> 00:22:00,454
Chris, is just like there is an

384
00:22:00,492 --> 00:22:03,126
expenditure of time and energy involved

385
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:06,618
in this classical channel, is the

386
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:08,406
quantum channel basically the opposite

387
00:22:08,438 --> 00:22:11,354
of that meaning its action is

388
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:14,810
instantaneous entanglement, presumably.

389
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,162
And also, again, back to that loop

390
00:22:17,226 --> 00:22:19,390
picture of entangled cycle,

391
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,334
is there just no passage of time, no

392
00:22:22,372 --> 00:22:25,854
expenditure of energy? Does any of that

393
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:29,406
make sense? Yeah. And I think it's

394
00:22:29,438 --> 00:22:32,606
worth actually going to the next slide

395
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:35,474
here where we complete the loop and add

396
00:22:35,512 --> 00:22:36,820
the quantum channel.

397
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,480
Is it this one? Yeah.

398
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,302
I think to understand what's going on

399
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:50,374
here, I think it's very useful to think

400
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:54,650
of it in terms of a Belly PR experiment,

401
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:59,254
right, where Bob,

402
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:01,450
in this case, the shared environment

403
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,774
includes the source that's creating the

404
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:10,174
entangled pair, which a

405
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:14,030
one and a two observe simultaneously.

406
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,250
They interact simultaneously with their

407
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,206
two detectors, which are interacting

408
00:23:22,238 --> 00:23:24,066
with the entangled pair. So you can

409
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:26,994
think of their two detectors are

410
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:31,240
entangled, and it's only later

411
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,050
that they exchange this classical

412
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,142
information. And in a Belly PR

413
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:38,070
experiment,

414
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,102
the elapsed time between the source

415
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:47,034
emitting the entangled pair and the

416
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:52,954
entangled pair interacting with the

417
00:23:52,992 --> 00:24:00,158
detectors deployed by a one and a two is

418
00:24:00,244 --> 00:24:02,554
designed as part of the experimental

419
00:24:02,602 --> 00:24:06,642
protocol to be less than the

420
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,874
time that it is required for a

421
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:11,534
one and a two to communicate

422
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:16,354
classically. And notice that from

423
00:24:16,552 --> 00:24:18,826
the point of view of the entangled pair

424
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:21,800
itself, no time has passed at all.

425
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,002
Right? The entangled pair

426
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:29,398
is, from a special relativity point of

427
00:24:29,404 --> 00:24:32,858
view, moving along a light like

428
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:37,494
trajectory. So there's

429
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,314
no distance being traversed and no time

430
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:43,418
is elapsing. From the point of view of

431
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:46,926
the entangled pair, there's only an

432
00:24:46,948 --> 00:24:50,474
elapsed time and a traverse distance

433
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:53,470
in the coordinates of the observers.

434
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,846
And it's those coordinates that define

435
00:24:58,878 --> 00:25:01,326
the parameters for the observer's

436
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:03,490
eventual classical communication.

437
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,266
So this is why I characterized

438
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,882
the assumption of classical

439
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:16,278
communication as a stipulation and

440
00:25:16,364 --> 00:25:19,094
also why I characterized it as a fine

441
00:25:19,132 --> 00:25:20,390
tuning assumption.

442
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,506
We are assuming something very specific

443
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:29,020
about this communication channel,

444
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,182
and we're assuming that the

445
00:25:35,236 --> 00:25:38,234
part of Bob, the part of the shared

446
00:25:38,282 --> 00:25:42,382
environment that implements this

447
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:44,480
classical communication channel,

448
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,666
behaves differently from the rest of the

449
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:51,586
shared environment. It behaves in

450
00:25:51,608 --> 00:25:54,690
a way that is classical,

451
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,538
but the rest of the shared environment

452
00:25:58,654 --> 00:26:02,438
doesn't. Right. The rest of the world is

453
00:26:02,524 --> 00:26:06,786
described using quantum theory. So we're

454
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:09,526
making this assumption that part of the

455
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:14,762
shared environment is special, and the

456
00:26:14,816 --> 00:26:18,042
specialness is that it behaves in this

457
00:26:18,096 --> 00:26:19,260
classical way.

458
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,894
So let me finish with this slide. I

459
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:28,282
suppose to go back to my earlier

460
00:26:28,346 --> 00:26:31,040
question about that Entangled loop being

461
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,206
at least Pictorically appears to be like

462
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:36,010
a degenerate version of this log

463
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,330
picture. If in this log picture I have

464
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,220
the quantum channel on the right,

465
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,890
that hypothetical entanglement

466
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,654
to complete the cycle on the left was

467
00:26:48,712 --> 00:26:52,594
only broken when a one and a two chose

468
00:26:52,642 --> 00:26:55,526
to write that into their memories at

469
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:57,894
different sectors. Right. And then that

470
00:26:57,932 --> 00:26:59,922
eventually necessitated the classical

471
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,866
communication between them. Is that

472
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:04,380
correct? Yeah.

473
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,098
One could always take the point of view

474
00:27:11,184 --> 00:27:14,474
of, if you will, the observer who's

475
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:17,982
outside the entire universe and just

476
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:21,002
sees the entire universe evolving

477
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:26,122
unitarily. And from

478
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:27,714
that point of view, there's no such

479
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:31,394
thing as classical communication. So the

480
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:35,150
communication is classical only relative

481
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,370
to this division between the Observers.

482
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,950
And that division between the observers

483
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,334
corresponds to their

484
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,310
measurement procedures, not commuting.

485
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:54,906
So it corresponds to what

486
00:27:55,088 --> 00:27:59,430
we think of classically as Alice

487
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:03,302
acting on her half of the entangled

488
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:06,906
state, determining what Bob will,

489
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:10,734
then that all

490
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,390
of that causal language is classical.

491
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:14,800
Right.

492
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,858
We're like at 1130. So halfway, more or

493
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:25,780
less, let's say a few words on

494
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,606
the later slide process and all of

495
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:35,894
that. I guess before

496
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:37,606
we start talking about this, which will

497
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:40,486
take us like five to ten minutes at

498
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:42,922
most, could you say a few words again

499
00:28:42,976 --> 00:28:46,906
about the fine tuning assumption? So I

500
00:28:46,928 --> 00:28:48,794
still can't quite understand what is

501
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:51,222
meant here, that this whole classical

502
00:28:51,286 --> 00:28:53,162
communication stuff requires fine

503
00:28:53,216 --> 00:28:54,010
tuning.

504
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,970
Okay. I think a way to think about it

505
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,504
is to

506
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,972
think about what it means to say that

507
00:29:15,026 --> 00:29:17,272
Alice and Bob are able to communicate

508
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:18,140
classically.

509
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,580
What we're saying is that Alice and Bob

510
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,656
share some sort of language. So when

511
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:29,536
they exchange their data, we can think

512
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:32,172
of their data as written in some binary

513
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:33,570
code in a data.

514
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,690
Alice says,

515
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,072
I set my instrument this way and I saw

516
00:29:43,126 --> 00:29:46,540
this spin. I then set my instrument

517
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,624
this other way, and I made this

518
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:51,972
observation. So Alice, his data table,

519
00:29:52,036 --> 00:29:54,760
or a one's data table,

520
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,776
is just a long table with two

521
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,244
entries in each row. One entry is how

522
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:07,484
the detector was adjusted, and the other

523
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:10,236
entry is what the value of the spin was

524
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:13,676
observed. And Bob's data table looks the

525
00:30:13,698 --> 00:30:17,104
same. And so they share this

526
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:19,104
information, or they share it with some

527
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:21,664
third party, they communicate it

528
00:30:21,702 --> 00:30:24,956
classically. And there are two aspects

529
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:27,810
to that classical communication. One is

530
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,260
that up to classical noise,

531
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,004
their data tables don't change when

532
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:44,744
they share them. So they

533
00:30:44,782 --> 00:30:47,610
really are irreversibly recorded.

534
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,952
They're not evolving in time along

535
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:54,860
with the rest of the universe.

536
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,644
The other aspect is that we have to

537
00:30:59,682 --> 00:31:02,716
assume that Alice and Bob mean the same

538
00:31:02,818 --> 00:31:07,810
thing by

539
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,704
their notations in these data tables so

540
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:15,136
that they can actually compare them, so

541
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:17,760
that they can actually do the statistics

542
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,528
and see if they've violated Bell's

543
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:23,796
inequality. So what that means is we

544
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:26,436
have to assume that they actually share

545
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:30,004
a definition of up, and that when they

546
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:32,216
talk about changing the settings on

547
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:35,176
their instruments, they're talking about

548
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:37,512
changing those settings with respect to

549
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:39,690
some shared definition of,

550
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,588
you know, in a real experiment, that

551
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:45,948
shared definition of up is provided by

552
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:48,076
the Earth's gravitational field or

553
00:31:48,098 --> 00:31:50,456
something like that. Earth's magnetic

554
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:53,464
field, some shared environmental

555
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:57,856
variable. So now

556
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:01,936
it seems like we have a

557
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:05,404
situation in which Alice One and Alice

558
00:32:05,452 --> 00:32:08,852
Two should be entangled because they

559
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:12,304
share this reference frame that enables

560
00:32:12,352 --> 00:32:14,420
them to communicate classically,

561
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,284
but they can't be entangled if

562
00:32:19,322 --> 00:32:20,672
they're going to communicate

563
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,540
classically.

564
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,496
So we make an assumption that

565
00:32:29,678 --> 00:32:31,610
in just this case,

566
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,716
they share a reference frame, but

567
00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:38,524
they're not entangled. They're able

568
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:40,792
to communicate classically while sharing

569
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:45,244
the reference frame. And we

570
00:32:45,282 --> 00:32:48,976
can sort of wave our hands and say they

571
00:32:48,998 --> 00:32:51,248
only share the reference frame up to

572
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:53,552
some measurement resolution or something

573
00:32:53,606 --> 00:32:57,584
like that. But despite the hand

574
00:32:57,622 --> 00:33:00,564
waving, we're making a very specific

575
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:04,820
assumption that violates

576
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,340
the fact that reference frame sharing

577
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,424
induces entanglement. So that's the fine

578
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:17,736
tuning assumption. We assume that the

579
00:33:17,758 --> 00:33:21,608
universe is such that in this very

580
00:33:21,694 --> 00:33:23,770
specific kind of case,

581
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,224
we can have reference frame sharing

582
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:28,620
without entanglement.

583
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,864
Cool. Let's keep it here

584
00:33:36,902 --> 00:33:39,344
and just open it up a little bit if

585
00:33:39,462 --> 00:33:42,688
Harris or Dean want to just give any

586
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,036
thought or reflection on what we've

587
00:33:45,068 --> 00:33:49,040
gotten to so far. Harris,

588
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,724
if you want to, please. Yes.

589
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:54,470
Everything is very interesting.

590
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,860
Basically, I was listening with great,

591
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:03,450
let's say focus. It reminded me this,

592
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,100
let's say, elaboration on the previous

593
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,104
talk that Chris gave two weeks ago. It

594
00:34:10,142 --> 00:34:12,036
reminded me something that Michael Levin

595
00:34:12,068 --> 00:34:16,076
said some time ago. It is

596
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:19,070
regarding this amazing ability of

597
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,710
cognition to scale up. So it's not only

598
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,856
this understanding, let's say, of the

599
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:30,544
scattering of cognition, but also the

600
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:34,064
scaling up of cognition. And when

601
00:34:34,102 --> 00:34:37,730
I tried to get inside my head,

602
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,710
actually, that as Chris said

603
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,356
in one of his talks, that if a

604
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:49,348
system is a tag wall, one cannot draw a

605
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:54,250
meaningful boundary across it. So this

606
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,420
fine tuning, let's say elaboration

607
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,276
that was made right now actually helps

608
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,940
me understand that even better.

609
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,004
So thank you, Chris, for that and thank

610
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:09,390
you Ander for this.

611
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,256
Thank you. Thank you. I'm glad that

612
00:35:16,278 --> 00:35:20,304
helped. Yeah, I think

613
00:35:20,342 --> 00:35:23,552
this is intimately related to the

614
00:35:23,606 --> 00:35:30,710
question of what cognition is since

615
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,390
if we have a purely quantum system,

616
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,052
there really is a deep sense in which

617
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:40,992
nothing is happening because of the time

618
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:45,380
symmetry. So to talk about cognition

619
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,960
as something that actually occurs,

620
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,000
we have to think of it classically.

621
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,488
Thank you. Also, if you allow me another

622
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,416
comment on that, basically one of the

623
00:36:02,438 --> 00:36:06,336
comments posted during your last talk

624
00:36:06,518 --> 00:36:09,072
in the chat had to do with classical

625
00:36:09,136 --> 00:36:12,132
memories. And I was thinking about that

626
00:36:12,186 --> 00:36:14,372
and I came to the conclusion that

627
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,596
classical memories presupposes a

628
00:36:16,618 --> 00:36:19,796
gestation period. And when I

629
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:22,632
think about it, that actually makes

630
00:36:22,686 --> 00:36:25,370
sense. And it is true, let's say,

631
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,964
for both physical and psychological

632
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:32,756
reasons. So, for example, a hard disk

633
00:36:32,788 --> 00:36:34,616
needs to write data on its magnetic

634
00:36:34,648 --> 00:36:37,036
surface and a human brain needs to

635
00:36:37,058 --> 00:36:40,072
consolidate all those neural connections

636
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:43,580
through synaptic plasticity. Let's say.

637
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,650
However, when we start thinking about

638
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,164
quantum information and quantum

639
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:57,072
memories, let's say we realize that such

640
00:36:57,126 --> 00:37:00,832
memories will be such quantum memories

641
00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:04,484
basically will be stored in qubits or

642
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,564
in those entagle states that you

643
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:09,424
describe. So they do not necessarily

644
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:13,016
have the same limitations. And of

645
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:16,132
course, quantum information theory

646
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:18,808
suggests, as I understand it, that

647
00:37:18,894 --> 00:37:21,432
quantum memories can be created and

648
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:24,748
accessed instantaneously without any

649
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:28,252
form of ingestation, let's say without

650
00:37:28,306 --> 00:37:31,164
any ingestation period. And of course

651
00:37:31,202 --> 00:37:33,912
this goes back and it has the potential,

652
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:37,484
as I see, to revolutionize computation

653
00:37:37,612 --> 00:37:41,100
in terms of quantum computation,

654
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,060
but also, and most importantly,

655
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,868
communication and quantum cryptography

656
00:37:47,884 --> 00:37:52,196
even. And this is something that I

657
00:37:52,218 --> 00:37:54,550
am truly interested in.

658
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,660
So yeah, I just wanted to share also

659
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,350
that.

660
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,570
Yeah, that's a very good point.

661
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,684
And the flip side is the

662
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:16,908
issue of stability which again

663
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,944
gets to the notion of environmental

664
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:23,276
decoherence which is just

665
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:26,624
the process of observation of the

666
00:38:26,662 --> 00:38:29,984
quantum state by some

667
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:33,008
environment or some observer, some

668
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:34,960
component of its environment.

669
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,204
And the reason this

670
00:38:39,242 --> 00:38:43,412
is a problem in practice is that we

671
00:38:43,466 --> 00:38:46,100
don't have complete control of all

672
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,020
components of the environment,

673
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,104
right? So we

674
00:38:54,142 --> 00:38:57,704
have to use things like liquid helium to

675
00:38:57,742 --> 00:39:01,064
try to keep the environment at bay to

676
00:39:01,102 --> 00:39:04,764
prevent decoherence because

677
00:39:04,882 --> 00:39:07,420
any other components of the environment

678
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,924
interacting with our quantum memory will

679
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:12,780
alter the state of the memory.

680
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,370
Yeah, that is

681
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,560
a great answer and basically the reason

682
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:27,200
why I typed that question. Regarding

683
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,576
super selection rules, and namely me,

684
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:34,312
I propose something called fuzzy super

685
00:39:34,366 --> 00:39:38,024
selection rules. Basically, as I

686
00:39:38,062 --> 00:39:40,196
understand it, those super selection

687
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:42,984
rules, the classical ones, let's say

688
00:39:43,102 --> 00:39:46,044
they are based on symmetries or on all

689
00:39:46,082 --> 00:39:49,100
those conversation laws that actually

690
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,648
limit the accessibility or our capacity

691
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:55,672
to measure, let's say, certain quantum

692
00:39:55,736 --> 00:39:59,276
properties, let's say, maybe it's

693
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:01,596
parity, maybe it's angular momentum,

694
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04,976
maybe it's even charge. But if

695
00:40:04,998 --> 00:40:08,644
we start thinking like these fuzzy super

696
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:11,744
selection rules in an effort to relax

697
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,324
these restrictions by allowing some

698
00:40:14,362 --> 00:40:17,632
degree of coherence or interference

699
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:20,016
between the different super selected

700
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:23,300
sectors, which can be quantified,

701
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,672
let's say, by a parameter called

702
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:28,436
fuzziness. I know that in other fields,

703
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,404
like in my field, that is fuzzy

704
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:33,544
cognitive mapping, the introduction of

705
00:40:33,582 --> 00:40:37,304
fuzziness from as it

706
00:40:37,342 --> 00:40:39,808
was propounded by Professor Lotfield

707
00:40:39,844 --> 00:40:42,860
Zadek, it actually helped a lot of our

708
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,076
models to become more accurate, let's

709
00:40:46,108 --> 00:40:49,484
say. So this is what I am proposing.

710
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:52,770
Maybe of course, I don't expect it to

711
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,016
revolutionize quantum information, but

712
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:58,368
maybe it can help us understand a bit

713
00:40:58,534 --> 00:41:01,652
better what is going on and the role of

714
00:41:01,786 --> 00:41:03,972
the coherence that comes out of the

715
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:06,836
environment. So if we incorporate it as

716
00:41:06,858 --> 00:41:09,424
a parameter of fuzziness, a priority,

717
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:12,010
then maybe we can understand and even

718
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,650
what we are dealing with.

719
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:22,780
Yeah. I would refer you

720
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:27,450
to the paper by Bartlett.

721
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,166
There are two other co authors in

722
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:36,942
2007, a lovely review

723
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:39,166
of quantum reference frames in reviews

724
00:41:39,198 --> 00:41:42,034
of modern Physics. And a point that they

725
00:41:42,072 --> 00:41:45,570
make that I think is relevant here is

726
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,090
that a super selection rule

727
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,950
can always be interpreted.

728
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:57,686
Let me see. I'm not sure I'll be able to

729
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:00,070
completely reproduce their argument,

730
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,846
but they show that a super selection

731
00:42:03,878 --> 00:42:06,362
rule can always be interpreted as the

732
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:10,230
absence of a reference frame or the lack

733
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,578
of a reference frame. And one of

734
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:18,314
the examples that they give is charge

735
00:42:18,362 --> 00:42:21,120
conservation, that we never see

736
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,406
superpositions of different electric

737
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:30,290
charges. And their

738
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,394
point is we never see this because we

739
00:42:33,432 --> 00:42:36,018
have no way of measuring it. We have no

740
00:42:36,104 --> 00:42:40,260
reference frame that we could use

741
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:45,014
that would allow us to see a state

742
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:49,030
of superposed charges.

743
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,370
And effectively what they're saying is

744
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,074
our reference frames are all made of

745
00:42:56,192 --> 00:43:02,762
matter that is

746
00:43:02,816 --> 00:43:05,834
composed of stuff that has well defined

747
00:43:05,882 --> 00:43:09,502
electric charges. So we can't see

748
00:43:09,556 --> 00:43:12,334
things that are superpositions of

749
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:15,294
charge. And it's very difficult for us

750
00:43:15,332 --> 00:43:17,534
to see things that are superpositions of

751
00:43:17,572 --> 00:43:23,106
position. So this

752
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:27,682
question of what is

753
00:43:27,736 --> 00:43:30,134
a super selection rule, why do we have

754
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:33,254
these rules, at least in their

755
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:36,518
reasoning, boils down to the question of

756
00:43:36,604 --> 00:43:40,642
why do we have some reference frames

757
00:43:40,706 --> 00:43:43,210
or some measurement capabilities and not

758
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,260
others? What is it about us that

759
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,970
limits in some fundamental way our

760
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,970
ability to make measurements?

761
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,030
And I suspect that when you

762
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,840
talk about fuzziness, which is

763
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:06,670
a sense of classical uncertainty,

764
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:12,626
that you may be sort

765
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:15,906
of pointing in that direction, but I

766
00:44:15,928 --> 00:44:17,442
think it would be worth looking at that

767
00:44:17,496 --> 00:44:21,666
paper, which is largely written

768
00:44:21,698 --> 00:44:25,400
in English, right? The formalism is

769
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,590
kept in the background.

770
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,880
So it's a very nice paper.

771
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,140
Thank you.

772
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:41,466
Thank you. Andrew. Maybe mute a little

773
00:44:41,488 --> 00:44:44,410
bit. Dean on the Mountaintop,

774
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,520
what can you throw down on us?

775
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,850
I don't have anything super special

776
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,122
throw down. I have a question, though,

777
00:44:57,176 --> 00:45:00,486
and because I am very comfortable in

778
00:45:00,508 --> 00:45:02,742
that fuzzy space, I kind of see

779
00:45:02,796 --> 00:45:06,406
relationships and

780
00:45:06,428 --> 00:45:09,218
their lack of definability as a feature.

781
00:45:09,314 --> 00:45:12,040
So here's kind of my question.

782
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,546
So you talked about a minimum sort of

783
00:45:15,568 --> 00:45:16,934
two different memories to encode

784
00:45:16,982 --> 00:45:18,842
something in time. And I think it was

785
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:20,426
one of the slides just after the one

786
00:45:20,448 --> 00:45:23,402
that's up here right now, which sounds

787
00:45:23,456 --> 00:45:25,434
to me like somewhere processing

788
00:45:25,482 --> 00:45:27,742
capacity. It sounds like we are kind of

789
00:45:27,796 --> 00:45:30,654
stepping back and trying to look at this

790
00:45:30,692 --> 00:45:33,806
instantaneous thing from the

791
00:45:33,828 --> 00:45:36,014
relative position of even the things

792
00:45:36,052 --> 00:45:39,234
that are classical can be seen as all.

793
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:41,854
So that when you mentioned that earlier,

794
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:43,940
Chris, that helped me quite a bit.

795
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,914
Which then manifests itself as a

796
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,182
classical ability to process somewhere.

797
00:45:49,326 --> 00:45:52,978
I spent a lot of my career self labeling

798
00:45:52,994 --> 00:45:56,642
as a wayfinder. So not capacity

799
00:45:56,706 --> 00:45:58,200
realization, relationship.

800
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,254
Just as a relationship. It means that

801
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:06,538
wayfinding is not just an orienting or

802
00:46:06,624 --> 00:46:09,834
a processing where I am and being

803
00:46:09,872 --> 00:46:12,118
gripped by sort of the thing that I'm

804
00:46:12,134 --> 00:46:14,318
enveloped by. It's also the channel,

805
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:16,286
the screen, the bound, the divide, the

806
00:46:16,308 --> 00:46:19,450
gap, the unentangled potentiator.

807
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,094
It's the thing upon which traction can

808
00:46:22,132 --> 00:46:24,960
exist as being a gripper as well.

809
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,866
I was already hung up on I wanted to go

810
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:33,214
back like Colombo in that old 70s TV

811
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:36,146
show and talk about Z spin because I

812
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,754
think Z spin is an energy way of

813
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:41,446
describing. But I honestly think when I

814
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:44,162
went back and watched your presentation

815
00:46:44,226 --> 00:46:46,438
a couple of times, I'm starting to get a

816
00:46:46,444 --> 00:46:49,510
sense that Z spin is also relationship

817
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,162
it's that affordance, that allows us

818
00:46:53,216 --> 00:46:55,926
to be able to see up and down. But I'm

819
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:58,794
just curious, Chris, are we really

820
00:46:58,832 --> 00:47:01,818
talking about processing somewhere in

821
00:47:01,824 --> 00:47:04,574
the classical sense, but because we have

822
00:47:04,612 --> 00:47:07,582
these two ways of encoding different

823
00:47:07,636 --> 00:47:09,742
memories, we're also talking about

824
00:47:09,796 --> 00:47:13,950
somewhere processing just that state

825
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:17,538
that allows for that's. My question

826
00:47:17,624 --> 00:47:20,626
is that what we're really getting, are

827
00:47:20,648 --> 00:47:22,194
we trying to open that up, that

828
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:23,460
possibility up?

829
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:32,422
Yeah, I think that's a nice way to think

830
00:47:32,476 --> 00:47:33,400
about it.

831
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:40,434
I think we're trying to, at some deep

832
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:43,914
level come

833
00:47:43,952 --> 00:47:47,722
up with a way of describing what it

834
00:47:47,776 --> 00:47:51,180
means to be an agent.

835
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:56,062
And I'll say in our case, a self

836
00:47:56,116 --> 00:48:00,030
conscious agent with a sense of

837
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,834
time that's embedded

838
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:08,338
in an environment that we

839
00:48:08,424 --> 00:48:12,180
depend on to store memories for us.

840
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:17,380
And what I mean by that is that

841
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:22,790
we depend on the environment

842
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:27,090
to change very slowly,

843
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,880
at least from our point of view,

844
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:34,602
so that we can keep some

845
00:48:34,656 --> 00:48:37,354
sense of our orientation within the

846
00:48:37,392 --> 00:48:40,860
environment. Right. We're using

847
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:47,326
everything we see as a memory that

848
00:48:47,428 --> 00:48:51,418
allows us to keep ourselves

849
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:53,934
fixed, which allows us to have a point

850
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:57,454
of view. So we're

851
00:48:57,502 --> 00:49:00,834
using the entire visible environment as,

852
00:49:00,952 --> 00:49:05,906
if you will, a reference frame against

853
00:49:06,008 --> 00:49:08,500
which we can see small changes.

854
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:13,394
But if the environment was constantly

855
00:49:13,442 --> 00:49:16,946
and rapidly changing, we wouldn't

856
00:49:16,978 --> 00:49:20,166
be able to do that and we wouldn't be

857
00:49:20,188 --> 00:49:22,346
able to use it as a memory and so we

858
00:49:22,368 --> 00:49:25,994
would have no point of view. So in

859
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:28,122
a sense, I think what we're talking

860
00:49:28,176 --> 00:49:34,574
about here is the

861
00:49:34,612 --> 00:49:37,134
miracle of having a point of view that

862
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:38,960
gives us a sense of time.

863
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,980
That's very philosophical.

864
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,384
It's amazing. And I wonder if along with

865
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:56,716
the perspectival visual advancements

866
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:59,024
which you and. Shannon Dobson have

867
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:01,940
explored. In the math art settings.

868
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,910
You're almost bringing that kind of a

869
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,852
transformative re understanding or re

870
00:50:08,906 --> 00:50:12,100
quantum reference framing into

871
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:16,104
a temporal setting where it's not just a

872
00:50:16,142 --> 00:50:19,848
static spatial parallax that we

873
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,776
are aesthetically and formally re

874
00:50:22,798 --> 00:50:25,930
understanding. But also a temporal one,

875
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,630
which, in an agent environment system,

876
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,044
necessitates these questions of

877
00:50:32,082 --> 00:50:35,256
communication, which, in the quantum

878
00:50:35,288 --> 00:50:37,016
information formalism, are approached

879
00:50:37,048 --> 00:50:39,836
topologically rather than geometrically,

880
00:50:39,948 --> 00:50:42,928
which is what we needed for the kind of

881
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:46,928
vanishing point type math art in

882
00:50:46,934 --> 00:50:48,320
the spatial setting.

883
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,056
Well, I think they're approached

884
00:50:53,088 --> 00:50:55,936
geometrically eventually and that's

885
00:50:55,968 --> 00:50:58,752
really what the session in September

886
00:50:58,816 --> 00:51:01,844
will be about. It's how to start with

887
00:51:01,882 --> 00:51:05,400
this very topological picture

888
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,810
where we're only talking about

889
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,416
interactions in

890
00:51:15,438 --> 00:51:18,812
a sense, interactions in time, but

891
00:51:18,866 --> 00:51:22,264
outside of space and layer a spatial

892
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,190
structure on top of that.

893
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,096
And I

894
00:51:30,118 --> 00:51:31,808
think this is particularly interesting

895
00:51:31,894 --> 00:51:34,770
in this active inference context because

896
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,692
it immediately raises biological

897
00:51:39,756 --> 00:51:44,404
questions about the

898
00:51:44,442 --> 00:51:46,960
ability of different organisms to layer

899
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,048
space on their experience and hence

900
00:51:50,144 --> 00:51:52,948
locate themselves, if you will, within

901
00:51:53,034 --> 00:51:55,690
some sort of perceived world.

902
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,256
Awesome. Dean and then back to Ander for

903
00:52:03,278 --> 00:52:04,170
the last minutes.

904
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,052
Oh, wait, unmute. Dean and then please

905
00:52:11,106 --> 00:52:14,190
continue. Sorry.

906
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,616
So, Chris, is it from the pure neophyte

907
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:21,952
perspective that I have, is it OK to say

908
00:52:22,086 --> 00:52:25,488
that it's not just a flipping of

909
00:52:25,654 --> 00:52:27,580
position of words, that somewhere

910
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,832
processing, that availability and

911
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:32,672
processing somewhere in the classical

912
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:35,972
sense, where am I? It's our

913
00:52:36,026 --> 00:52:39,190
ability to fuse those, as you mentioned,

914
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,596
we can slow down, we can stabilize, we

915
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,630
can see that relationship.

916
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:55,050
Or is it about spinning?

917
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:02,140
I think the former, right.

918
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,002
Spin is a very convenient abstraction

919
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:09,114
for talking about binary

920
00:53:09,242 --> 00:53:10,350
encoding.

921
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,452
And we have this felt sense of spin,

922
00:53:16,616 --> 00:53:20,784
but its use

923
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:23,324
in physics is very much an abstraction.

924
00:53:23,452 --> 00:53:25,244
I mean, the difference between a proton

925
00:53:25,292 --> 00:53:27,840
and neutron is a spin variable.

926
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,862
Awesome. Ander you can in the last

927
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:43,030
minutes take it where you need also

928
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,746
unmute and then continue. Can you guys

929
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:50,378
hear me now? So let's hope that I have

930
00:53:50,464 --> 00:53:52,298
time for Chris to address a couple of

931
00:53:52,304 --> 00:53:54,890
things. So just to conclude the slides

932
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:58,126
and then hopefully we get to say a few

933
00:53:58,148 --> 00:54:00,958
words on quantum Darwinism. So towards

934
00:54:01,044 --> 00:54:04,094
the end, the slides appear to start

935
00:54:04,132 --> 00:54:06,842
pivoting towards the next subject,

936
00:54:06,906 --> 00:54:10,706
which is space and time. And here in

937
00:54:10,728 --> 00:54:14,050
particular, we see the earlier slide

938
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:18,820
showcasing the Lock protocol where

939
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,074
you can notice that half of it has been

940
00:54:21,112 --> 00:54:24,534
cut and has been moved to the

941
00:54:24,572 --> 00:54:26,934
future. So here we don't have two

942
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,726
sectors of Alice communicating, but

943
00:54:28,748 --> 00:54:30,214
rather Alice communicating with its

944
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:32,754
future. Still, you have the classical

945
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,874
and the quantum channel. Now, one

946
00:54:34,912 --> 00:54:37,100
question that I brought up, I remember

947
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:40,726
and in the lecture,

948
00:54:40,838 --> 00:54:42,570
and maybe we can expand on a little

949
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,994
more, was exactly what is the difference

950
00:54:46,112 --> 00:54:48,422
between this quantum and the classical

951
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:51,722
channel part? Something I heard Chris

952
00:54:51,786 --> 00:54:53,886
say is that it is crucial for the

953
00:54:53,908 --> 00:54:56,126
quantum channel to be recohered. So this

954
00:54:56,148 --> 00:54:58,122
is going to be some sort of unitary

955
00:54:58,266 --> 00:55:02,770
scattering evolution that is completely

956
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,060
independent of everything else going on.

957
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:08,770
Is that correct or should be? In theory.

958
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,704
Yes. And I suppose, just like

959
00:55:16,742 --> 00:55:19,968
earlier, the classical channel is the

960
00:55:19,974 --> 00:55:23,552
part that takes time and free

961
00:55:23,606 --> 00:55:27,270
energy expenditure. Now, my question

962
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:32,596
to you, Chris, is not

963
00:55:32,618 --> 00:55:34,244
the channels in the middle, but the

964
00:55:34,282 --> 00:55:36,064
ticks on either side of the boundaries

965
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:38,336
that have been broken down and separated

966
00:55:38,528 --> 00:55:41,736
in terms of an external time. What's up

967
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:43,816
with those ticks from one sector to the

968
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:46,536
other of the boundary? So in Q one, for

969
00:55:46,558 --> 00:55:49,476
example, the lower TRF sector,

970
00:55:49,668 --> 00:55:52,172
that's that amount to a state was

971
00:55:52,226 --> 00:55:55,356
prepared. The upper one was I made a

972
00:55:55,378 --> 00:55:57,596
memory record of that state. That's what

973
00:55:57,618 --> 00:56:00,430
it is, right? Yeah.

974
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,124
Okay, so in the lower sector,

975
00:56:04,172 --> 00:56:07,056
we both had a preparation and a

976
00:56:07,078 --> 00:56:08,864
measurement, and a measurement was

977
00:56:08,902 --> 00:56:12,096
recorded classically here. That's all

978
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:16,296
there is. Yeah. So preparation

979
00:56:16,348 --> 00:56:19,060
and measurement are effectively the same

980
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:19,750
process.

981
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,644
And you can think of in

982
00:56:26,682 --> 00:56:30,552
a one of T, what a one

983
00:56:30,606 --> 00:56:33,050
is doing is,

984
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,390
from an operational point of view,

985
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,160
she's preparing an instrument

986
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,964
and turning it on. She's creating

987
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:53,330
an initial state,

988
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:59,376
and she's simultaneously encoding

989
00:56:59,408 --> 00:57:03,844
a memory someplace in

990
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:07,892
her head or on a piece of paper of what

991
00:57:07,946 --> 00:57:10,710
those preparation conditions were,

992
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,696
because it's only with respect to the

993
00:57:15,738 --> 00:57:17,268
memory of what the preparation

994
00:57:17,364 --> 00:57:20,676
conditions were that the later

995
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:23,260
measurement is meaningful.

996
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,980
Let's go back to just preparing a spin.

997
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,570
Right. At T, she may

998
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,716
set the angle of some polarization

999
00:57:42,828 --> 00:57:46,648
filter that defines a propagating

1000
00:57:46,844 --> 00:57:50,804
beam of photons. And at

1001
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,652
T plus delta T, she measures something

1002
00:57:53,706 --> 00:57:56,244
about what those photons are doing. But

1003
00:57:56,282 --> 00:57:59,112
the measurement is only meaningful with

1004
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:03,384
respect to her memory of what

1005
00:58:03,422 --> 00:58:05,636
the polarization setting that prepared

1006
00:58:05,668 --> 00:58:07,210
the photons was.

1007
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:12,600
So effectively,

1008
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,068
what's going on in the quantum channel

1009
00:58:15,234 --> 00:58:16,940
is an experiment,

1010
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,060
and it's

1011
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,092
the classical information that's

1012
00:58:26,156 --> 00:58:28,384
preserved in this classical channel that

1013
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,352
makes the experiment meaningful or

1014
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:33,744
interpretable or informative. Yeah, for

1015
00:58:33,782 --> 00:58:36,796
sure. Yeah, that makes perfect sense in

1016
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:38,416
preparation of measurement. This ties

1017
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,980
back to an earlier question we had both

1018
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:45,264
happen simultaneously at the same degree

1019
00:58:45,312 --> 00:58:48,084
of freedom at the boundary, or do we

1020
00:58:48,122 --> 00:58:50,512
have preparation at the lower bound

1021
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:52,630
measurement at the top of one?

1022
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:00,640
Yeah, one can think of that operator,

1023
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:04,616
Mi, if you remember the decomposition

1024
00:59:04,648 --> 00:59:07,772
of the Hamiltonian as preparing or

1025
00:59:07,826 --> 00:59:09,596
measuring. It's just a matter of

1026
00:59:09,618 --> 00:59:13,144
interpretation effectively.

1027
00:59:13,192 --> 00:59:15,296
Is it acting to the left or acting to

1028
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:18,912
the right? Yeah.

1029
00:59:19,046 --> 00:59:21,968
Okay. Yeah. Makes perfect. And then

1030
00:59:22,134 --> 00:59:24,316
before we get to quantum error

1031
00:59:24,348 --> 00:59:27,044
correction as more of a special instead

1032
00:59:27,082 --> 00:59:30,132
of a time thing, I wanted to ask about

1033
00:59:30,186 --> 00:59:32,230
yet another question between this one.

1034
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,096
So the quantum channels does involve

1035
00:59:36,128 --> 00:59:40,020
some sort of time evolutionary

1036
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:44,408
portion, that is, this portion that is

1037
00:59:44,494 --> 00:59:47,204
evolving unitarily with no interference

1038
00:59:47,252 --> 00:59:50,712
from the outside. However, as you said,

1039
00:59:50,766 --> 00:59:53,148
for this experiment to make sense, you

1040
00:59:53,154 --> 00:59:56,844
need to have a classical memory of how

1041
00:59:56,882 --> 00:59:59,804
that experiment was prepared so that

1042
00:59:59,842 --> 01:00:03,020
means that that classical guy on top is

1043
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:05,470
static. There's no time flow in it.

1044
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:10,064
Well, this actually gets back to the

1045
01:00:10,102 --> 01:00:12,080
talk by Suskin that we were talking

1046
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,424
about before we started here that you

1047
01:00:15,462 --> 01:00:17,030
kindly referred me to.

1048
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:24,790
Part of this classical memory is

1049
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,804
memory for what counts as a classical

1050
01:00:30,932 --> 01:00:34,296
clock. And we'll actually get to

1051
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:36,516
this again in the September session.

1052
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:39,144
But if you think again about doing an

1053
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:42,364
experiment in which a state is

1054
01:00:42,402 --> 01:00:45,788
prepared and then it's measured, this

1055
01:00:45,874 --> 01:00:49,836
quantum process is a process through

1056
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:55,724
time with respect to some classical

1057
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:59,372
clock that actually provides

1058
01:00:59,436 --> 01:01:02,400
the time coordinate for the experiment.

1059
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:07,380
So this

1060
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:11,072
classical clock is some external

1061
01:01:11,136 --> 01:01:16,852
reference frame that a

1062
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:20,180
one here in this notation is

1063
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:23,620
using as part of her classical memory.

1064
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,504
Right. Again, it's a

1065
01:01:28,542 --> 01:01:30,244
memory because it's something that's

1066
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:32,090
assumed not to change.

1067
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,724
This will be kind of the heart of the

1068
01:01:37,762 --> 01:01:40,908
discussion in September that time

1069
01:01:40,994 --> 01:01:44,784
and memory and object persistence are

1070
01:01:44,982 --> 01:01:47,792
all different names for this same

1071
01:01:47,846 --> 01:01:50,130
assumption that we make about the world.

1072
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,324
Thank you, Chris. Thank you. I am

1073
01:02:00,362 --> 01:02:02,310
going to have to so.

1074
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,510
Only for now though. Yeah, only for now.

1075
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,760
I will nonetheless persist someplace.

1076
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:15,528
Thank you, Chris, so much, Chris. Okay,

1077
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:19,050
awesome. See you. Thanks very much.

1078
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:20,890
Measure you later.

1079
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:29,310
Andrew, if you wanted to drop any other

1080
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,232
cues or clues or bring

1081
01:02:35,286 --> 01:02:37,424
us a little bit of a preparation for

1082
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,184
where we're going to be heading in

1083
01:02:39,302 --> 01:02:41,490
lecture five, that would be pretty cool.

1084
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:46,484
Sure. So, I mean, I'm a little aware of

1085
01:02:46,522 --> 01:02:48,150
what's coming in lecture five.

1086
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,764
It's about space and time and how space

1087
01:02:53,882 --> 01:02:56,564
may be sorry, time may be a little more

1088
01:02:56,602 --> 01:02:58,744
fundamental than space for reasons that

1089
01:02:58,782 --> 01:03:03,464
Chris will show has

1090
01:03:03,502 --> 01:03:05,144
a lot to do with the notion of how you

1091
01:03:05,182 --> 01:03:07,672
define a clock. As in we need to think

1092
01:03:07,726 --> 01:03:11,096
hard about what

1093
01:03:11,118 --> 01:03:14,664
are the bare minimum ingredients for you

1094
01:03:14,702 --> 01:03:16,696
to talk about the existence of a clock.

1095
01:03:16,888 --> 01:03:18,684
These are deep, fundamental, almost

1096
01:03:18,722 --> 01:03:20,316
philosophical questions that are

1097
01:03:20,418 --> 01:03:23,356
overlooked. And the good news, and

1098
01:03:23,378 --> 01:03:25,376
that's the Saskin talk that Chris and I

1099
01:03:25,398 --> 01:03:29,056
were referring to is that other people,

1100
01:03:29,158 --> 01:03:31,490
especially in the high energy community,

1101
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,840
are also looking into these questions,

1102
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,680
which is very reassuring. So I'm talking

1103
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,572
at Wheaton, Suskin, Harlow,

1104
01:03:38,636 --> 01:03:42,548
Et are there is a recent talk

1105
01:03:42,634 --> 01:03:45,396
on YouTube where they talk about what

1106
01:03:45,418 --> 01:03:48,528
does it mean for something to be a does,

1107
01:03:48,714 --> 01:03:51,656
how long does a clock last? And then

1108
01:03:51,758 --> 01:03:54,616
Chris will also talk about space. And

1109
01:03:54,638 --> 01:04:00,676
the punchline of it will be that there's

1110
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:02,932
obviously a physics approach to emergent

1111
01:04:02,996 --> 01:04:06,444
space time, which is very technical and

1112
01:04:06,482 --> 01:04:09,996
so on. But from what

1113
01:04:10,018 --> 01:04:12,990
I understood, I have yet to see the talk

1114
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,264
myself first is that there is a parallel

1115
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:21,324
biological approach as to how we learn

1116
01:04:21,362 --> 01:04:24,776
out spacetime. So from developmental

1117
01:04:24,808 --> 01:04:29,088
psychology point of you infants,

1118
01:04:29,184 --> 01:04:31,876
and I suppose all kinds of animals are

1119
01:04:31,898 --> 01:04:34,800
not Born fully equipped to perceive

1120
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,924
spacetime. Hence the necessity of things

1121
01:04:37,962 --> 01:04:40,696
like play and so on. So they can find

1122
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:44,216
correlations between motor inputs and

1123
01:04:44,238 --> 01:04:46,612
visual inputs, right? And eventually

1124
01:04:46,676 --> 01:04:48,904
things like the mirror test, which is

1125
01:04:48,942 --> 01:04:52,860
nontrivial. No human is Born

1126
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,604
passing the mirror test already. So that

1127
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,796
implies that at least biologically, it

1128
01:04:58,818 --> 01:05:01,096
is nontrivial. And it takes a few steps

1129
01:05:01,128 --> 01:05:03,470
until you get to have that sort of

1130
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,476
spatial awareness. Right? Now, the

1131
01:05:08,498 --> 01:05:09,984
interesting part, at least for me

1132
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:12,736
personally, is what the physics side of

1133
01:05:12,758 --> 01:05:16,076
it is. And I'm

1134
01:05:16,108 --> 01:05:17,796
no expert by any means, but I think the

1135
01:05:17,818 --> 01:05:19,620
gist of it might have to do something

1136
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:23,744
with quantum error correction adseft

1137
01:05:23,872 --> 01:05:27,056
and so on. There was a bit of a teaser

1138
01:05:27,088 --> 01:05:29,576
about quantum error correction here in

1139
01:05:29,598 --> 01:05:32,664
these. Yeah, I mean, that's that's about

1140
01:05:32,702 --> 01:05:35,624
all I can say. But very looking forward

1141
01:05:35,662 --> 01:05:38,456
to the biology also. Yeah,

1142
01:05:38,558 --> 01:05:41,976
cool. Harris any last thoughts

1143
01:05:42,008 --> 01:05:44,670
or anything you want to point towards?

1144
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,028
Basically, I would like to thank

1145
01:05:48,114 --> 01:05:50,812
everyone for inviting me. I really

1146
01:05:50,866 --> 01:05:56,140
enjoyed it the whole Livestream.

1147
01:05:56,740 --> 01:06:00,720
I hope we have made some progress

1148
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:05,330
and looking forward to the next

1149
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,670
live streams number five and number six.

1150
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,636
So that's about it. Thank you,

1151
01:06:13,658 --> 01:06:17,044
everyone. Thank you. Anything else?

1152
01:06:17,082 --> 01:06:20,260
Andrew that's it. Awesome. Well,

1153
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:22,596
I encourage everyone to go to the

1154
01:06:22,618 --> 01:06:25,750
syllabus page, look ahead, look back,

1155
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:30,228
prejust digest, regest, ask questions

1156
01:06:30,394 --> 01:06:33,772
and end. Let's make progress as you

1157
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:36,956
exhort. Harris so, see you all.

1158
01:06:37,058 --> 01:06:37,850
Till next time.
