1
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,390
All right.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,070
Hello and welcome everyone.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:20,570
It is Saturday, August 26, 2023 and we're here in “Physics as information processing,” in the fourth discussion.

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,470
Thank you everybody.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,550
Who's joining live or watching.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,266
Live or watching in replay.

7
00:00:25,418 --> 00:00:28,530
This should be a really fun discussion as usual.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:43,290
So we're going to have Ander provide some slides and some initial clarifying questions for Chris and then we're going to open it up for our guests to ask some questions and check in a live chat, see what people are talking about.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,050
So Ander, to you for some slides and overview.

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,394
Okay.

11
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:49,222
Thank you, Daniel.

12
00:00:49,286 --> 00:00:57,614
So last time we were starting to talk about multi-agent communication and LOCC protocols and all of that.

13
00:00:57,732 --> 00:01:04,430
So let's quickly go through the slides and sort of try to recall the main concepts.

14
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,170
I guess just to go back to session 3 for a second.

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:21,350
One takeaway was that when you have noncommunicative sectors in a boundary, that's necessarily going to require classical communication between them.

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:30,170
So that is more or less the whole point of today, how noncommunicative sectors have to communicate classically.

17
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:48,474
Another introduction in this last lecture was this new graphical notation, TQFT, if you wish to call it that way for any of these clock ticks.

18
00:01:48,522 --> 00:02:14,470
Okay, so let's recall the whole process of measuring a sector environment and writing it into a memory environment can be simplified to this sort of tick that connects two portions of the boundary. Everything we talk about LOCC protocols will be written in this graphical notation.

19
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,300
So let's keep going a little bit.

20
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,562
This slide is on the paper on sequential measurements from 2022 [(2022) Sequential Measurements, Topological Quantum Field theories, and Topological Quantum Neural networks. Fields C, Glazebrook JW and Marcianò A].

21
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:36,858
These are basically the formal mapping between QRFs and topological quantum field theories.

22
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:37,214
Okay.

23
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:42,714
So we're more used to the picture here on the left hand side of this slide, right with the QRF sectors.

24
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:47,490
But pictorically speaking, this is at least how they map.

25
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,714
Okay?

26
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:58,418
And then from then we started talking about entanglement and classical communications using this notation.

27
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:02,120
And this is probably where my questions to Chris will start.

28
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:13,770
So in section 3, we saw this idea of the FEP asymptotically being the principle of unitarity, a.k.a, driving the system, the joint system, Alice and Bob to entanglement, which in this graphical notation, amounts to them sort of completing a cycle here where the QRFs are perfectly aligned, so that the S sector of one becomes the memory sector of the other and viceversa. I actually at this point already, I have a question for Chris. I have it written down.

29
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:50,886
Yes.

30
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:52,790
Two things here, Chris.

31
00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:06,826
Number 1 - in the LOCC protocol picture we distinguish between a quantum channel and a classical channel.

32
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:17,962
And if I understood that part correctly, we said that passage of time or expenditure of energy, free energy, only corresponds to the classical tick.

33
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:30,738
So in this quantum entanglement picture where you don't quite have that, is it fair to say that there's no such thing as a classical tick no passage of time, no expenditure of free energy.

34
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:42,582
Is this a degenerate picture of the LOCC protocol where the sectors were aligned the right way and boom, you got rid of that classical thing and that's it.

35
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:55,020
And secondly, I guess, what does it mean for these two parts, quote unquote from the paper, to implement a joint quantum process?

36
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:11,860
So, yeah, this is not a LOCC protocol, clearly, because there is no classical communication.

37
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:21,012
And in fact, Alice is not divided into multiple compartments here. Alice is just implementing this single quantum process, Q.

38
00:05:29,360 --> 00:06:16,308
And because these QRFs are perfectly aligned, we can think of...remember from probably the 2nd session, the picture that you were very interested in, the Wick rotation reversing time between Alice and Bob.

39
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:28,860
So Alice's clock in fact ticks in the opposite direction from Bob's clock because both of their internal clocks are counting incoming bits, not outgoing bits.

40
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:38,930
In this, in the right side of this picture, there is no overall time.

41
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:50,980
You can think of Alice's clock ticking forward one unit and then Bob's clock ticking backward one unit.

42
00:06:51,720 --> 00:07:02,388
So that the information flow is completely time symmetric between Alice and Bob.

43
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:11,550
So we can think of both of these processes, Q and Q prime, as bi-directional in time.

44
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,710
That's what it means to have a pure unitary process.

45
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,784
So no time asymmetry.

46
00:07:19,832 --> 00:07:20,760
That's what it is.

47
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,152
Right.

48
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:24,108
So there is no time asymmetry in this picture.

49
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:30,300
And when you introduce classical communication, of course you have to have a time asymmetry.

50
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:30,880
Right.

51
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:37,700
Because you have this, I mean, classicality is defined by this notion of irreversibility.

52
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,060
I see.

53
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,656
Which is just the same as time asymmetry.

54
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:45,976
And it's the irreversibility that burns energy.

55
00:07:46,078 --> 00:08:16,970
So there has to be energy flow between Alice and Bob to drive what is from a global point of view and only an apparent asymmetry, but from the point of view of Alice 1 and Alice 2 as components of Alice, they're the ones who see the asymmetry.

56
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:36,026
So I guess just to tie back to the question of the Wick rotation, once this joint process is implemented, naively, one can say, is this cycle going clockwise or counterclockwise?

57
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:45,700
And is that going to define on, originally--whenever these guys ended up being lined up, where the Wick sign was coming from?

58
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,520
Yes.

59
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:59,190
Whenever Alice sees information flowing in, Bob sees information flowing out.

60
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:04,810
So their Wick rotations are going in opposite directions.

61
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:06,860
Okay.

62
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,020
Yeah, very good.

63
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:45,590
The other thing to think of in this picture--it's impossible to draw all of these simultaneously--is that if you think of the FEP as fully aligning Alice and Bob, then not only do these processes perfectly couple, but the area that's green in this right hand side kind of expands to fill the whole boundary.

64
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:59,480
So that in the complete limit of Alice being able to perfectly predict Bob and vice versa, then the whole boundary is green.

65
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:11,870
So there's no this distinction between the S sector, and the Y sector disappears.

66
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,294
Yes, that makes sense, actually.

67
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:31,138
And just to conclude with this slide, back in the session 2, we saw something about agents requiring a free choice of reference frame for their QRFs, which amounts to being able to choose how to measure a spin.

68
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:32,806
Right, right.

69
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:42,150
So is part of this entanglement picture; do they just have to align the sectors, or also the way they are measuring a spin on those sectors?

70
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,598
Yes, they have to align the way they're measuring the spin in those sectors.

71
00:10:48,774 --> 00:11:02,990
It's that lack of--remember the point that free choice of local reference frame is required for separability.

72
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:17,300
So as the systems become fully entangled, then their local reference frames for each qubit become the same.

73
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,500
Become necessarily the same.

74
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,078
Thank you.

75
00:11:26,244 --> 00:11:26,622
Okay.

76
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:28,880
And then let's continue a little bit.

77
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:35,250
So in this talk, we're mainly interested on QRFs that do not commute.

78
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:46,754
Now, maybe, Chris, you can tie this back to what you were saying earlier about if you're perfectly entangled, then the sector is going to grow.

79
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,166
Does it have anything to do with this?

80
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:57,720
So if Q1 and Q2 here do commute, then how do you reduce this to the picture on the right hand side?

81
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:05,130
At the first glance, it looks like the picture on the left hand side encompasses more sectors of the boundary.

82
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,090
Yeah.

83
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:56,710
The point here is just that if we go back to the notation where what we're representing by this simplified notation is a collection of Cone-Cocone diagrams, and if these reference frames commute, then one can take these two diagrams and find a...think of it in the information inflow direction...there will always be a common Cone-Cocone over the two sets of input classifiers if the two QRFs commute.

84
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:39,534
So what that means is that I go from a diagram with two sets of classifiers, each going up to some apex, to a diagram with the merged set of classifiers going up to some farther up the hierarchy apex because they commute.

85
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:48,570
I can find that sort of yet more abstract Cone-Cocone that covers all of the classifiers in both QRFs.

86
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:59,034
So that just collapses these pairs of green segments down to one green segment.

87
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:00,830
And I've drawn it the same size.

88
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,154
I mean, it would make more sense graphically, I suppose, to draw it.

89
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:05,842
Right.

90
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:10,740
Each one is twice as big or twice the area.

91
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:25,800
But keeping to this kind of very topological representation where the area isn't actually meaningful, it is convenient to draw it this way.

92
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:26,982
Right.

93
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:32,810
So in short, the fact that they commute means that you will have that higher apex anyway, so you can bypass that first nesting.

94
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,202
Right.

95
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:39,530
But it comes to the number of degrees of freedom at the boundary.

96
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,098
They're still the same.

97
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:44,170
And in terms of area right, okay.

98
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,630
Yeah.

99
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,600
We're not getting rid of any of the degrees of freedom of the boundary that these QRFs are looking at.

100
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,750
Yeah, very good.

101
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,706
So the next slide I found a very interesting one.

102
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:12,070
So these are no-go theorems things that Alice and Bob cannot do, and it's mainly having to do about measuring their own entanglement entropy and counting degrees of freedom.

103
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:22,554
I guess this has a very holographic feel to it, and also maybe even a bit of a Godel theorem feel to it.

104
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:25,420
So I don't know if Chris wants to comment on that.

105
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:51,250
Well, I'll just say that I think this does have a kind of Godel undecidability feel to it, in that there are a large number of questions that Alice can't answer, which certainly suggests a formulation in terms of incompleteness.

106
00:15:52,310 --> 00:16:08,150
And the connection to Godel's theorem is actually something that Jim Glazebrook and I are currently working on, and hopefully we'll be able to make that connection more precise.

107
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:30,090
But the point of these statements is just to emphasize that a single observer that's uncompartmentalized cannot determine anything about the entanglement entropy of the environment.

108
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:39,214
And this is just the result that to measure entanglement, you have to employ a LOCC protocol, so you have to have classical communication.

109
00:16:42,710 --> 00:17:08,700
And this raises a fundamental issue in the theory in that classical communication is an exchange of information that cannot be represented as a single quantum process.

110
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:31,570
Hence, you have language like the collapse of the wave function, or these various other decoherence, etcetera, etcetera, these various ways of trying to capture this idea that something different and irreversible is happening as soon as you talk about classical communication.

111
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:45,030
So the point is, for Alice to measure anything about the entanglement entropy of Bob, she has to be sectored.

112
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:54,122
So her entanglement entropy has to decrease, but she can't know that.

113
00:17:54,256 --> 00:18:00,700
She can't actually know that she has sectored compartments when we think of Alice as an entire system.

114
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:14,030
So from now on, we're going to be talking about the very limited points of view of particular observers.

115
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,218
And to talk about that.

116
00:18:19,384 --> 00:18:41,414
I think it's very important to keep these various limitations in mind, because there's a real distinction between what we can say effectively from this kind of God's eye point of view that we're adopting as theorists, where we say Alice has sectors that are communicating classicall,y and what Alice's system can do from her point of view, or her sectors can do from their points of view.

117
00:19:04,004 --> 00:19:10,420
And this is a distinction that's often ignored, but it's important to keep it in mind.

118
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,940
Awesome.

119
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:21,330
Thanks for this line, Ander.

120
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,198
Yeah.

121
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:24,280
So should we continue?

122
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:48,350
Yeah, then I guess we get to the proper material of the last lecture, which is what happens when you have sectors that are commutative, such as two portions of Alice involved that have to communicate classically.

123
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,950
This is what requires the classical communication tick.

124
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,400
Let me see.

125
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:11,074
So would it be fair to say, Chris, this--only such a classical channel,such as the one shown in this slide,requires free energy.

126
00:20:11,272 --> 00:20:12,178
Is that right?

127
00:20:12,264 --> 00:20:15,750
Because there's some writing into a memory involved in here...compared to the earlier slide where we had that closed loop in the entangled picture, there was no expenditure of energy, is that correct?

128
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:39,040
The example to keep in mind here is exactly the process that we're executing right now.

129
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:49,730
Alice has two components, and we are currently in the position of those components.

130
00:20:50,470 --> 00:21:00,870
And we're communicating classically with each other by employing a channel that's part of our shared environment.

131
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:08,390
So we are acting irreversibly on our shared environment.

132
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:19,020
And it's that irreversible action on the environment that has the free energy cost for each of us.

133
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:33,520
We actually have to make noise to communicate, and our laptops are actually consuming power.

134
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,118
All of this is classical.

135
00:21:36,314 --> 00:21:42,850
It's this irreversibility that defines classicality.

136
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:52,194
Right. And to continue with this question, I guess it will come, I'm sure in later slides, but the other side of this LOCC protocol is the quantum channel.

137
00:21:55,452 --> 00:22:14,810
And my question to you, Chris, is just like there is an expenditure of time and energy involved in this classical channel, is the quantum channel basically the opposite of that, meaning its action is instantaneous entanglement, presumably, and also, again, back to that loop picture of entangled cycle, is there just no passage of time, no expenditure of energy?

138
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,740
Does any of that make sense?

139
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,610
Yeah,and I think it's worth actually going to the next slide here where we complete the loop and add the quantum channel.

140
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,662
Is it this one?

141
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:41,480
Yeah.

142
00:22:44,090 --> 00:23:14,030
I think to understand what's going on here, I think it's very useful to think of it in terms of a Bell EPR experiment, right, where Bob, in this case, the shared environment includes the source that's creating the entangled pair, which A1 and A2 observe simultaneously.

143
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:23,502
They interact simultaneously with their two detectors, which are interacting with the entangled pair.

144
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:34,760
So you can think of their two detectors are entangled, and it's only later that they exchange this classical information.

145
00:23:35,690 --> 00:24:12,450
And in a Bell EPR experiment, the elapsed time between the source emitting the entangled pair, and the entangled pair interacting with the detectors deployed by A1 and A2 is designed as part of the experimental protocol to be less than the time that it is required for A1 and A2 to communicate classically.

146
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:21,800
And notice that from the point of view of the entangled pair itself, no time has passed at all.

147
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,080
Right?

148
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:34,010
The entangled pair is, from a special relativity point of view, moving along a light-like trajectory, so there's no distance being traversed and no time is elapsing from the point of view of the entangled pair. There's only an elapsed time and a traverse distance in the coordinates of the observers.

149
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:03,490
And it's those coordinates that define the parameters for the observers' eventual classical communication.

150
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:20,390
So this is why I characterized the assumption of classical communication as a stipulation, and also why I characterized it as a fine-tuning assumption.

151
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:48,930
We are assuming something very specific about this communication channel, and we're assuming that the part of Bob, the part of the shared environment that implements this classical communication channel, behaves differently from the rest of the shared environment.

152
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:59,350
It behaves in a way that is classical, but the rest of the shared environment doesn't. Right. The rest of the world is described using quantum theory.

153
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:19,260
So we're making this assumption that part of the shared environment is special, and the specialness is that it behaves in this classical way.

154
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,666
So let me finish with this slide, I suppose. So to go back to my earlier question about that entangled loop being, at least pictorically, appears like a degenerate version of this LOCC picture.

155
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:56,322
If in this LOCC picture I have the quantum channel on the right, that hypothetical entanglement to complete the cycle on the left was only broken when A1 and A2 chose to write that into their memories at different sectors, right, and then that eventually necessitated the classical communication between them.

156
00:27:01,468 --> 00:27:02,460
Is that correct?

157
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,380
Yeah, you know, one could always take the point of view of, if you will, the observer whose outside the entire universe and just sees the entire universe evolving unitarily, and from that point of view, there's no such thing as classical communication.

158
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:38,370
So the communication is classical only relative to this division between the observers.

159
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:50,310
And that division between the observers corresponds to their measurement procedures not commuting.

160
00:27:51,230 --> 00:28:13,390
So it corresponds to what we think of classically as Alice acting on her half of the entangled state, determining what Bob will then see. All of that causal language is classical.

161
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:14,800
Right.

162
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,450
We're like at 1130.

163
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:32,200
So halfway, more or less, let's say a few words on the later slide, scattering is LOCC and all of that.

164
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:44,774
I guess before we start talking about this, which will take us like five to ten minutes at most, could you say a few words again about the fine-tuning assumption?

165
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:54,010
So I still can't quite understand what is meant here, that this whole classical communication stuff requires fine-tuning.

166
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,720
Okay.

167
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:18,140
I think a way to think about it is to think about what it means to say that Alice and Bob are able to communicate classically.

168
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,068
What we're saying is that Alice and Bob share some sort of language.

169
00:29:26,184 --> 00:29:33,570
So when they exchange their data, we can think of their data as written in some binary code in a data table, you know, Alice says, I set my instrument this way and I saw this spin.

170
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,596
I then set my instrument this other way, and I made this observation.

171
00:29:49,788 --> 00:30:02,360
So Alice's data table, or A1's data table, is just a long table with two entries in each row.

172
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:11,180
One entry is how the detector was adjusted, and the other entry is what the value of the spin was observed.

173
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,270
And Bob's data table looks the same.

174
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:22,480
And so they share this information, or they share it with some third party, they communicate it classically.

175
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,780
And there are two aspects to that classical communication.

176
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:41,690
One is that up to classical noise, their data tables don't change when they share them, so they really are irreversibly recorded.

177
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:54,860
They're not evolving in time along with the rest of the universe.

178
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:21,540
The other aspect is that we have to assume that Alice and Bob mean the same thing by their notations in these data tables so that they can actually compare them, so that they can actually do the statistics and see if they've violated Bell's inequality.

179
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:49,196
So what that means is we have to assume that they actually share a definition of up, and that when they talk about changing the settings on their instruments, they're talking about changing those settings with respect to some shared definition of up, and you know, in a real experiment, that shared definition of up is provided by the Earth's gravitational field or something like that, Earth's magnetic field, some shared environmental variable.

180
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:21,540
So now it seems like we have a situation in which Alice 1 and Alice 2 should be entangled because they share this reference frame that enables them to communicate classically, but they can't be entangled if they're going to communicate classically.

181
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:36,220
So we make an assumption that, in just this case, they share a reference frame, but they're not entangled.

182
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,380
They're able to communicate classically while sharing the reference frame.

183
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:54,450
And we can sort of wave our hands and say they only share the reference frame up to some measurement resolution or something like that.

184
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:13,012
But despite the hand waving, we're making a very specific assumption that violates the fact that reference frame sharing induces entanglement.

185
00:33:13,156 --> 00:33:15,800
So that's the fine-tuning assumption.

186
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:28,620
We assume that the universe is such that in this very specific kind of case, we can have reference frame sharing without entanglement.

187
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,950
Cool.

188
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:46,370
Let's keep it here and just open it up a little bit if Haris or Dean want to just give any thought or reflection on what we've gotten to so far.

189
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,870
Haris, if you want to, please.

190
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,724
Yes.

191
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:54,470
Everything is very interesting.

192
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,270
Basically, I was listening with great, let's say focus.

193
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:09,608
It reminded me this, let's say, elaboration on the previous talk that Chris gave two weeks ago.

194
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:14,350
It reminded me something that Michael Levin said some time ago.

195
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:21,630
It is regarding this amazing ability of cognition to scale up.

196
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:32,556
So it's not only this understanding, let's say, of the scattering of cognition, but also the scaling up of cognition.

197
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:51,424
And when I tried to get inside in my head, actually, that as Chris said in one of his talks, that if a system is a tag wall, one cannot draw a meaningful boundary across it.

198
00:34:51,562 --> 00:35:04,940
So this fine-tuning, let's say elaboration that was made right now actually helps me understand that even better.

199
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,390
So thank you, Chris, for that and thank you Ander for this elaboration.

200
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,924
Thank you.

201
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,040
I'm glad that helped.

202
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:41,960
Yeah, I think this is intimately related to the question of what cognition is since if we have a purely quantum system, there really is a deep sense in which nothing is happening because of the time symmetry.

203
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:51,000
So to talk about cognition as something that actually occurs, we have to think of it classically.

204
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,344
Thank you.

205
00:35:56,482 --> 00:36:09,860
Also, if you allow me another comment on that, basically one of the comments posted during your last talk in the chat had to do with classical memories.

206
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:17,940
And I was thinking about that and I came to the conclusion that classical memories presupposes a gestation period.

207
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,240
And when I think about it, that actually makes sense.

208
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:29,812
And it is true, let's say, for both physical and psychological reasons.

209
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:42,744
So, for example, a hard disk needs to write data on its magnetic surface and a human brain needs to consolidate all those neural connections through synaptic plasticity.

210
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:43,580
Let's say.

211
00:36:43,730 --> 00:37:07,360
However, when we start thinking about quantum information and quantum memories, let's say, we realize that such memories will be such quantum memories basically will be stored in qubits or in those entagled states that you describe.

212
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,540
So they do not necessarily have the same limitations.

213
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:30,312
And of course, quantum information theory suggests, as I understand it, that quantum memories can be created and accessed instantaneously without any form of gestation, let's say without any gestation period.

214
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:48,508
And of course this goes back and it has the potential, as I see, to revolutionize computation in terms of quantum computation, but also, and most importantly, communication and quantum cryptography even.

215
00:37:48,694 --> 00:37:54,550
And this is something that I am truly interested in.

216
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,350
So yeah, I just wanted to share also that.

217
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,570
Yeah, that's a very good point.

218
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:34,960
And the flip side is the issue of stability which again gets to the notion of environmental decoherence which is just the process of observation of the quantum state by some environment or some observer, some component of its environment.

219
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:50,150
And the reason this is a problem in practice is that we don't have complete control of all components of the environment, right?

220
00:38:51,580 --> 00:39:12,780
So we have to use things like liquid helium to try to keep the environment at bay to prevent decoherence because any other components of the environment interacting with our quantum memory will alter the state of the memory.

221
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:26,160
Yeah, that is a great answer and basically the reason why I typed that question regarding super selection rules, and namely me, I propose something called fuzzy super selection rules.

222
00:39:36,700 --> 00:40:03,280
Basically, as I understand it, those super selection rules, the classical ones, let's say they are based on symmetries or on all those conservation laws that actually limit the accessibility or our capacity to measure, let's say, certain quantum properties, let's say, maybe it's parity, maybe it's angular momentum, maybe it's even charge.

223
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:26,740
But if we start thinking like these fuzzy super selection rules in an effort to relax these restrictions by allowing some degree of coherence or interference between the different super selected sectors, which can be quantified, let's say, by a parameter called fuzziness.

224
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:46,496
I know that in other fields, like in my field, that is fuzzy cognitive mapping, the introduction of fuzziness, as it was propounded by Professor Lotfi Aliasker Zadeh, it actually helped a lot of our models to become more accurate, let's say.

225
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:49,484
So this is what I am proposing.

226
00:40:49,532 --> 00:41:04,672
Maybe of course, I don't expect it to revolutionize quantum information, but maybe it can help us understand a bit better what is going on and the role of the coherence that comes out of the environment.

227
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:14,650
So if we incorporate it as a parameter of fuzziness, a priority, then maybe we can understand what we are dealing with.

228
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,260
Yeah.

229
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:27,450
I would refer you to the paper by Bartlett...there are two other co-authors--in 2007--a lovely review of quantum reference frames in Reviews of Modern Physics [2007, Reference frames, superselection rules, and quantum information, Bartlett SD, Rudolph T, Spekkens RW].

230
00:41:40,654 --> 00:41:52,950
And a point that they make, that I think is relevant here, is that a super selection rule can always be interpreted.

231
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,480
Let me see...I'm not sure I'll be able to completely reproduce their argument, but they show that a super selection rule can always be interpreted as the absence of a reference frame or the lack of a reference frame.

232
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:26,270
And one of the examples that they give is charge conservation--that we never see superpositions of different electric charges.

233
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:35,234
And their point is--we never see this because we have no way of measuring it.

234
00:42:35,272 --> 00:42:49,030
We have no reference frame that we could use that would allow us to see a state of superposed charges.

235
00:42:50,490 --> 00:43:07,150
And effectively what they're saying is our reference frames are all made of matter that is composed of stuff that has well defined electric charges.

236
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:12,906
So we can't see things that are superpositions of charge.

237
00:43:13,018 --> 00:43:18,160
And it's very difficult for us to see things that are superpositions of position.

238
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:43,658
So this question of what is a super selection rule, why do we have these rules, at least in their reasoning, boils down to the question of why do we have some reference frames or some measurement capabilities and not others?

239
00:43:43,744 --> 00:43:52,970
What is it about us that limits in some fundamental way our ability to make measurements?

240
00:43:54,190 --> 00:44:23,160
And I suspect that when you talk about fuzziness, which is a sense of classical uncertainty, that you may be sort of pointing in that direction, but I think it would be worth looking at that paper, which is largely written in English, right?

241
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:27,590
The formalism is kept in the background.

242
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,880
So it's a very nice paper.

243
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,140
Thank you.

244
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,260
Thank you.

245
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:40,502
Ander, maybe mute a little bit.

246
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,520
Dean on the mountaintop, what can you throw down on us?

247
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,778
I don't have anything super special throw down.

248
00:44:55,944 --> 00:45:09,218
I have a question, though, and because I am very comfortable in that fuzzy space, I kind of see relationships and their lack of definability as a feature.

249
00:45:09,314 --> 00:45:12,040
So here's kind of my question.

250
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:17,594
So you talked about a minimum sort of two different memories to encode something in time.

251
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:26,122
And I think it was one of the slides just after the one that's up here right now, which sounds to me like "somewhere" processing capacity.

252
00:45:26,186 --> 00:45:39,234
It sounds like we are kind of stepping back and trying to look at this instantaneous thing, from the relative position of even the things that are classical that can be seen as all quantum.

253
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:43,940
So that when you mentioned that earlier, Chris, that helped me quite a bit.

254
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:49,182
Which then manifests itself as a classical ability to process somewhere.

255
00:45:49,326 --> 00:45:54,390
I spent a lot of my career self-labeling as a wayfinder.

256
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,200
So not capacity realization--relationship, just as a relationship.

257
00:46:02,524 --> 00:46:12,746
It means that wayfinding is not just an orienting or a processing, where I am and being gripped by sort of the thing that I'm enveloped by.

258
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:19,450
It's also the channel, the screen, the bound, the divide, the gap, the unentangled potentiator.

259
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:24,960
It's the thing upon which traction can exist as being a gripper as well.

260
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:39,758
I was already hung up on I wanted to go back like Colombo in that old 70s TV show, and talk about Z spin because I think Z spin is an energy way of describing.

261
00:46:39,934 --> 00:46:55,290
But I honestly think when I went back and watched your presentation a couple of times, I'm starting to get a sense that Z spin is also relationship. It's that affordance that allows us to be able to see up and down.

262
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:16,798
But I'm just curious, Chris, are we really talking about processing somewhere in the classical sense, but because we have these two ways of encoding different memories, we're also talking about, somewhere processing, just that state that allows for that.

263
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:23,460
My question is that--what we're really getting, are we trying to open up that possibility?

264
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:33,400
Yeah, I think that's a nice way to think about it.

265
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:51,180
I think we're trying to, at some deep level come up with a way of describing what it means to be an agent and I'll say in our case, a self-conscious agent with a sense of time that's embedded in an environment that we depend on to store memories for us.

266
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:38,250
And what I mean by that is that we depend on the environment to change very slowly, at least from our point of view, so that we can keep some sense of our orientation within the environment.

267
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:39,770
Right.

268
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:54,720
We're using everything we see as a memory that allows us to keep ourselves fixed, which allows us to have a point of view.

269
00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:08,500
So we're using the entire visible environment as, if you will, a reference frame against which we can see small changes.

270
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:24,060
But if the environment was constantly and rapidly changing, we wouldn't be able to do that and we wouldn't be able to use it as a memory and so we would have no point of view.

271
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:38,960
So in a sense, I think what we're talking about here is the miracle of having a point of view that gives us a sense of time.

272
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,980
That's very philosophical.

273
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,856
It's amazing.

274
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:57,936
And I wonder if along with the perspectival visual advancements which you and Shannon Dobson have explored in the math art settings, you're almost bringing that kind of a transformative re-understanding or re-quantum reference framing into a temporal setting where it's not just a static spatial parallax that we are aesthetically and formally re-understanding.

275
00:50:23,636 --> 00:50:48,320
But also a temporal one, which, in an agent environment system, necessitates these questions of communication, which, in the quantum information formalism, are approached topologically rather than geometrically, which is what we needed for the kind of vanishing point type math art in the spatial setting.

276
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:59,908
Well, I think they're approached geometrically eventually and that's really what the session in September will be about.

277
00:51:00,074 --> 00:51:24,190
It's how to start with this very topological picture where we're only talking about interactions in a sense, interactions in time, but outside of space and layer a spatial structure on top of that.

278
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:55,690
And I think this is particularly interesting in this active inference context because it immediately raises biological questions about the ability of different organisms to layer space on their experience and hence locate themselves, if you will, within some sort of perceived world.

279
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:00,664
Awesome.

280
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:04,170
Dean and then back to Ander for the last minutes.

281
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,056
Oh, wait, unmute.

282
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:11,710
Dean and then please continue.

283
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,190
Sorry.

284
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:34,790
So, Chris, is it from the pure neophyte perspective that I have, is it OK to say that it's not just a flipping of position of words, that somewhere processing--that availability and processing somewhere in the classical sense of "where am I"...

285
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:44,630
It's our ability to fuse those, as you mentioned, we can slow down, we can stabilize, we can see that relationship.

286
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:55,050
Or is it about spin?

287
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:02,140
I think the former, right.

288
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:10,350
Spin is a very convenient abstraction for talking about binary encoding.

289
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:23,324
And we have this felt sense of spin, but its use in physics is very much an abstraction.

290
00:53:23,452 --> 00:53:27,840
I mean, the difference between a proton and neutron is a spin variable.

291
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:33,560
Awesome.

292
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:44,360
Ander you can in the last minutes take it where you need, also unmute and then continue.

293
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,660
Can you guys hear me now?

294
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:52,714
So let's hope that I have time for Chris to address a couple of things.

295
00:53:52,832 --> 00:53:59,690
So just to conclude the slides and then hopefully we get to say a few words on quantum Darwinism.

296
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:08,640
So towards the end, the slides appear to start pivoting towards the next subject, which is space and time.

297
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:24,870
And here in particular, we see the earlier slide showcasing the LOCC protocol where you can notice that half of it has been cut and has been moved to the future.

298
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:30,840
So here we don't have two sectors of Alice communicating, but rather Alice communicating with its future.

299
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:34,098
Still, you have the classical and the quantum channel.

300
00:54:34,284 --> 00:54:49,520
Now, one question that I brought up, I remember and in the lecture, and maybe we can expand on a little more, was exactly what is the difference between this quantum and the classical channel part?

301
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:55,610
Something I heard Chris say is that it is crucial for the quantum channel to be recohered.

302
00:54:55,690 --> 00:55:05,060
So this is going to be some sort of unitary scattering evolution that is completely independent of everything else going on.

303
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,938
Is that correct, or should be in theory?

304
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,870
Yes.

305
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:24,988
And I suppose, just like earlier, the classical channel is the part that takes time and free energy expenditure.

306
00:55:25,164 --> 00:55:40,490
Now, my question to you, Chris, is not the channels in the middle, but the ticks on either side of the boundaries that have been broken down and separated in terms of an external time.

307
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:44,964
What's up with those ticks from one sector to the other of the boundary?

308
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:52,984
So in Q1, for example, the lower QRF sector, that amounts to a state that was prepared.

309
00:55:53,112 --> 00:55:57,004
The upper one was "I made a memory record of that state."

310
00:55:57,122 --> 00:55:58,670
That's what it is, right?

311
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,430
Yeah.

312
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:10,610
Okay, so in the lower sector, we both had a preparation and a measurement, and a measurement was recorded classically here.

313
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,850
That's all there is.

314
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:14,816
Yeah.

315
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:19,750
So preparation and measurement are effectively the same process.

316
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:49,890
And you can think of, in A1 of (t) is what A1 is doing, which is--from an operational point of view--she's preparing an instrument and turning it on.

317
00:56:50,820 --> 00:57:23,260
She's creating an initial state, and she's simultaneously encoding a memory someplace in her head, or on a piece of paper of what those preparation conditions were, because it's only with respect to the memory of what the preparation conditions were that the later measurement is meaningful.

318
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,980
Let's go back to just preparing a spin.

319
00:57:34,822 --> 00:57:48,420
At (t), she may set the angle of some polarization filter that defines a propagating beam of photons.

320
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:55,812
And at t plus delta t, (t+dt), she measures something about what those photons are doing.

321
00:57:55,946 --> 00:58:07,210
But the measurement is only meaningful with respect to her memory of what the polarization setting that prepared the photons was.

322
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:32,720
So effectively, what's going on in the quantum channel is an experiment, and it's the classical information that's preserved in this classical channel that makes the experiment meaningful or interpretable or informative.

323
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,320
Yeah, for sure.

324
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:37,904
Yeah, that makes perfect sense in preparation of measurement.

325
00:58:37,952 --> 00:58:52,630
This ties back to an earlier question we had... both happen simultaneously at the same degree of freedom at the boundary, or do we have preparation at the lower bound measurement, at [inaudible]?

326
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:08,424
Yeah, one can think of that operator, mi...if you remember the decomposition of the Hamiltonian as preparing or measuring.

327
00:59:08,552 --> 00:59:13,144
It's just a matter of interpretation effectively.

328
00:59:13,192 --> 00:59:16,050
Is it acting to the left or acting to the right?

329
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:18,912
Yeah.

330
00:59:19,046 --> 00:59:19,344
Okay.

331
00:59:19,382 --> 00:59:19,968
Yeah.

332
00:59:20,134 --> 00:59:21,072
Makes perfect sense.

333
00:59:21,206 --> 00:59:32,230
And then before we get to quantum error correction as more of a spatial instead of a time thing, I wanted to ask about yet another question between this one.

334
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:48,170
So the quantum channel does involve some sort of time evolutionary portion, that is, this portion that is evolving unitarily with no interference from the outside.

335
00:59:49,100 --> 01:00:03,640
However, as you said, for this experiment to make sense, you need to have a classical memory of how that experiment was prepared, so that means that classical guy on top is static.

336
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,470
There's no time flow in it.

337
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:17,030
Well, this actually gets back to the talk by [Leonard] Susskind that we were talking about before we started here, that you kindly referred me to.

338
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:31,800
Part of this classical memory is memory for what counts as a classical clock.

339
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:36,516
And we'll actually get to this again in the September session.

340
01:00:36,708 --> 01:01:02,400
But if you think again about doing an experiment in which a state is prepared and then it's measured, this quantum process is a process through time with respect to some classical clock that actually provides the time coordinate for the experiment.

341
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:23,620
So this classical clock is some external reference frame that A1 here in this notation is using as part of her classical memory.

342
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:25,904
Right.

343
01:01:25,962 --> 01:01:32,090
Again, it's a memory because it's something that's assumed not to change.

344
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:50,130
This will be kind of the heart of the discussion in September that time and memory and object persistence are all different names for this same assumption that we make about the world.

345
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,420
Thank you, Chris.

346
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,796
Thank you.

347
01:01:59,898 --> 01:02:02,310
I am going to have to disappear.

348
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,110
Only for now though.

349
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,510
Yeah, only for now.

350
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,760
I will nonetheless persist someplace.

351
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,660
Thank you, Chris, so much, Chris.

352
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,410
Okay, awesome.

353
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:17,816
See you.

354
01:02:17,918 --> 01:02:19,050
Thanks very much.

355
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:20,890
Measure you later.

356
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:41,490
Ander, if you wanted to drop any other cues or clues or bring us a little bit of a preparation for where we're going to be heading in lecture 5, that would be pretty cool.

357
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:43,712
Sure.

358
01:02:43,766 --> 01:02:48,150
So, I mean, I'm a little aware of what's coming in lecture 5.

359
01:02:49,560 --> 01:03:06,244
It's about space and time and how space may be, sorry, time may be a little more fundamental than space, for reasons that Chris will show...has a lot to do with the notion of how you define a clock, as in, we need to think hard about what are the bare minimum ingredients for you to talk about the existence of a clock.

360
01:03:16,888 --> 01:03:21,528
These are deep fundamental, almost philosophical questions that are overlooked.

361
01:03:21,704 --> 01:03:35,004
And the good news, and that's the [Leonard] Susskind talk that Chris and I were referring to, is that other people, especially in the high energy community, are also looking into these questions, which is very reassuring.

362
01:03:35,052 --> 01:03:50,570
So I'm talking at [Edward] Witten, [Leondard] Susskind, [Daniel] Harlow, etc. There is a recent talk on YouTube where they talk about what does it mean for something to be a clock; how long does a clock last?

363
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,770
And then Chris will also talk about space.

364
01:03:54,300 --> 01:04:07,324
And the punchline of it will be that there's obviously a physics approach to emergent spacetime, which is very technical and so on.

365
01:04:07,522 --> 01:04:22,600
But from what I understood (I have yet to see the talk myself first), is that there is a parallel biological approach as to how we learn out spacetime.

366
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:35,712
So from developmental psychology point of view infants, and I suppose all kinds of animals are not born fully equipped to perceive spacetime, hence, the necessity of things like play and so on.

367
01:04:39,294 --> 01:04:45,784
So they can find correlations between motor inputs and visual inputs, right?

368
01:04:45,902 --> 01:04:49,880
And eventually things like the mirror test, which is nontrivial.

369
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:55,070
No human is born passing the mirror test already.

370
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,832
So that implies that at least biologically, it is nontrivial.

371
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:06,632
And it takes a few steps until you get to have that sort of spatial awareness.

372
01:05:06,776 --> 01:05:07,470
Right?

373
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,520
Now, the interesting part, at least for me personally, is what the physics side of it is.

374
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:24,950
And I'm no expert by any means, but I think the gist of it might have to do something with quantum error correction, [acronyms?] and so on.

375
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:30,170
There was a bit of a teaser about quantum error correction here in these.

376
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,850
Yeah, I mean, that's that's about all I can say.

377
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:37,130
But very looking forward to the biology also.

378
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,304
Yeah, cool.

379
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:44,670
Haris any last thoughts or anything you want to point towards?

380
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,028
Basically, I would like to thank everyone for inviting me.

381
01:05:50,194 --> 01:05:56,140
I really enjoyed it the whole livestream.

382
01:05:56,740 --> 01:06:09,670
I hope we have made some progress and looking forward to the next live streams number 5 and number 5.

383
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,220
So that's about it.

384
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:14,230
Thank you, everyone.

385
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,750
Thank you.

386
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,044
Anything else, Ander?

387
01:06:17,082 --> 01:06:19,396
That's it.

388
01:06:19,498 --> 01:06:19,860
Awesome.

389
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:31,468
Well, I encourage everyone to go to the syllabus page, look ahead, look back, pregest, digest, regest, ask questions and let's make progress as you exhort, Haris.

390
01:06:34,552 --> 01:06:36,956
So, see you all.

391
01:06:37,058 --> 01:06:37,850
Till next time.
