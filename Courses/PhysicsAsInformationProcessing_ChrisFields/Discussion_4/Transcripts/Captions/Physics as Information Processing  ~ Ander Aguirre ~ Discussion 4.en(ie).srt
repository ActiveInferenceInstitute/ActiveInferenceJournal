1
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,940
all right hello and welcome everyone it

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,199
is Saturday August 26 2023 and we're

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,060
here in physics as information

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,400
processing in the fourth discussion

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,680
thank you everybody who's joining live

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,960
or watching live or watching and replay

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,539
this should be a really fun discussion

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,859
as usual

9
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,260
so we're gonna have under provide some

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,079
slides and some initial clarifying

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,360
questions for Chris and then we're gonna

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,600
open it up for our guests to ask some

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
questions and check in a live chat see

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,879
what people are talking about so honor

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,120
to you for some slides and overview

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,360
okay thank you Daniel so um last time we

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,719
were starting to to talk about

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,280
multi-agent communication and log

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,379
protocols and all of that so let's

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,320
quickly growth go through the slides and

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,660
uh sort of try to recall the main

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,339
Concepts

23
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,900
so

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,159
um I guess from

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,619
just to go back uh to session three for

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,680
a second uh one takeaway was that when

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,720
you have non-comedian sectors in a

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,820
boundary that's necessarily going to

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,260
require

30
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,140
classical communication between them so

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,420
that is more or less the whole point of

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,960
today uh how non-commune sectors May

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,520
communicate have to communicate

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,439
classically

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,559
um

36
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,360
another uh introduction in in this last

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,400
lecture was uh

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,180
this new graphical notation uh tqft if

39
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,759
you wish to call it that way for any of

40
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,040
these clock tips okay so so let's recall

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,259
the the whole process of uh measuring a

42
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,780
sector environment and writing it into a

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,939
memory environment it can be simplified

44
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,840
to this sort of tick the connect uh

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,880
connects to two two portions of the

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,239
boundary and you know uh

47
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,459
everything we talk about log protocols

48
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,140
will be will be written in this

49
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,780
graphical notation

50
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,580
um

51
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,120
so

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,260
let's keep going a little bit uh

53
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,120
it's on the paper on uh sequential

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,360
measurements from 20 2022 uh these are

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,700
basically the the formal mapping between

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,040
qrfs and uh

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,440
topological Quantum field theories okay

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,599
so we're more used used to the picture

59
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,220
here on the left hand side of this slide

60
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,739
right with with the qrf sectors but you

61
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:44,660
know

62
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,620
rhetorically speaking this is at least

63
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,760
how they map

64
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,140
um

65
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,000
okay and then uh from then uh we started

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,739
talking about entanglement and classical

67
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,300
Communications

68
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,400
using this notation and and this is

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
probably where my questions to Chris

70
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,519
will will start

71
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,900
uh so in section three uh we saw

72
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,159
this idea of the fvp asymptotically

73
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,819
being the principle of unitarity AKA

74
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,540
driving the system the join system Alice

75
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,480
involved uh to entanglement which in the

76
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,900
graphical notation amounts to them sort

77
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,239
of uh completing a a cycle here where

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,340
the QRS are perfectly aligned so that

79
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,340
the S sector of one becomes the memory

80
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,360
sector of the other and vice versa now I

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,220
actually at this point already I have a

82
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,459
question uh for for Chris I mean I have

83
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,739
written down here

84
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:47,519
um

85
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,180
so

86
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,580
so yes two things here uh Chris

87
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,760
number one uh is

88
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,319
um

89
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,620
in in the in the log protocol picture we

90
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,680
do have a distinguishing between a

91
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,560
Quantum Channel and a classical Channel

92
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,959
and if I understood that part correctly

93
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,700
we said that

94
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,980
passage of time or expenditure of energy

95
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,978
free energy only corresponds to the

96
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,238
classical tick so in this you know

97
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,280
quantum entanglement picture where you

98
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,960
don't quite have that it is it fair to

99
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,360
say that there's no such thing as as a

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
classical take no passage of time no

101
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,800
expenditure free energy is this a

102
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,380
degenerate picture of the log protocol

103
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,780
where the sectors were aligned the right

104
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,620
way

105
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,840
and boom you got rid of that classical

106
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,160
thing

107
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,860
and and that's it and secondly I guess

108
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,560
it's what does it mean for these two

109
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,520
parts quote unquote uh from the paper to

110
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,580
implement a joint uh unitary process you

111
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,900
join Quantum process

112
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,840
so yeah this is this is not a lock

113
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,100
protocol clearly because uh there there

114
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,240
is no classical uh communication

115
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,080
and and in fact uh Alice

116
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,220
is not divided into uh multiple

117
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,139
compartments here

118
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,100
uh Alice is just implementing one this

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,340
this single Quantum process Q

120
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,239
and uh

121
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,500
because these sectors are are because

122
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,759
these These qrfs are perfectly aligned

123
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,800
oh

124
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,840
we can think of

125
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,580
of

126
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,099
a a pro remember uh

127
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,539
probably the second session

128
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,479
the the the

129
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,720
picture that you were very interested in

130
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,460
under

131
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,840
how

132
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,479
of the wick rotation

133
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,139
uh

134
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,039
reversing time between Alice and Bob so

135
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,440
Ellis's clock in fact

136
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,139
uh ticks in the opposite direction from

137
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,720
Bob's clock because both of their

138
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,940
internal clocks are counting incoming

139
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,020
bits not outgoing bits

140
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,000
so in this in the right side of this

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,500
picture

142
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,060
um

143
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,539
there there is no overall time

144
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,460
you can think of

145
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,840
Alice's clock uh ticking forward one

146
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,100
unit

147
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,979
and then Bob's clock ticking backward

148
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,600
one unit

149
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,520
so that uh

150
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,639
the the information flow is completely

151
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,699
time symmetric between Alice and Bob

152
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,639
so we can think of of both of these

153
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,880
processes q and Q Prime

154
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,940
as bi-directional in time

155
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,220
that's that's what it means to have a

156
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,400
pure unitary process well

157
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,479
um

158
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,759
so no time I symmetry that's what it is

159
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,340
right so there is no time asymmetry in

160
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,580
this picture and once when you introduce

161
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,259
classical communication of course you

162
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,020
have to have a Time asymmetry right

163
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,840
because uh you have this I mean

164
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,300
classicality is defined by this notion

165
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,660
of irreversibility

166
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,639
which is just the same as As Time

167
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,940
asymmetry and it's the irreversibility

168
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,639
that burns energy so the

169
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,919
there has to be energy flow between

170
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,660
Alice and Bob

171
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,099
uh

172
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,300
to to drive

173
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,099
what is in from a global point of view

174
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,580
and only an apparent asymmetry but from

175
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,800
the point of view of

176
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,460
Alice 1 and Alice 2 as components of

177
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,479
Alice

178
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,080
oh they're the ones who see the

179
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,800
asymmetry

180
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,900
so I guess uh just to tie back to the

181
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,900
question of the weak rotation once this

182
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,840
joint uh process is implemented I mean

183
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,440
and iFly one can say is this cycle going

184
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,539
clockwise or counterclockwise and it's

185
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,120
is that going to Define on

186
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,000
originally whenever this guy's ended up

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,880
being lined up where the weak sign was

188
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,360
coming from

189
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,600
of

190
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,580
yes whenever

191
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,700
whenever Alice sees information flowing

192
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,700
in Bob sees information flowing out so

193
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,600
there

194
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,540
their their Wick rotations they're going

195
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,519
out opposite directions

196
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,519
okay

197
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,279
yeah uh very good

198
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,980
and uh yeah the other the other thing to

199
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,779
to think of in this picture which is

200
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,820
it's impossible to draw all of these

201
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,899
simultaneously is that if you if you

202
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,880
think of the fep

203
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,440
as

204
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,220
fully aligning Alice and Bob

205
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,580
then not only do these processes

206
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,500
perfectly couple

207
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,899
but the the area that's green

208
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,019
uh in this right hand side kind of

209
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,860
expands to fill the whole boundary so

210
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,980
that in the in the complete limit

211
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,560
of uh

212
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,899
Alice being able to perfectly predict

213
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,140
Bob and and vice versa then the whole

214
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,880
boundary is green right so the uh

215
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,980
there's no this distinction between

216
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,100
the the S sector and the Y sector

217
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,959
disappears

218
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,959
yes yes that makes sense actually and

219
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,300
just to conclude with this slide

220
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,519
um back in the session two we saw

221
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,220
something about uh agents requiring a

222
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,980
free choice of reference frame for their

223
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,800
qrfs which amounts to being able to

224
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,279
choose how to measure a spin right

225
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,339
right so it's part of this entanglement

226
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,620
picture like do they do they just have

227
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,959
to align the sectors or also the way

228
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,640
they are measuring a spin on those

229
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,800
sectors

230
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,680
yes they they they have to align the way

231
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,940
they're measuring the spin in those

232
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,120
sectors that it's that lack of remember

233
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,040
the the point that

234
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,600
uh

235
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,480
free choice of of

236
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,839
local reference frame

237
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,019
is required for separability

238
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:09,959
so as the systems become fully entangled

239
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,800
then their local reference frames for

240
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,480
each qubit

241
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,579
I'll become the same

242
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:22,279
that might become necessarily the same

243
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,779
thank you okay and then uh let's

244
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,160
continue a little bit

245
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,500
um so in in this in this talk we're

246
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,560
mainly interested uh uh krfs that do not

247
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,760
commute

248
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,579
uh now maybe uh you can of course you

249
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:39,959
can tie this back

250
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,899
to what you were saying earlier about if

251
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,899
you're perfectly entangled then the the

252
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:47,459
sector is going to grow does it have

253
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,740
anything to do with this so if q1 and Q2

254
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,240
here are

255
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,480
do commute then how does how do you

256
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,000
reduce this uh to the picture on the

257
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,200
right hand side

258
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,079
at the first class it looks like the

259
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:02,180
picture on the left hand side

260
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,500
encompasses uh more sectors of the

261
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,800
binary

262
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,300
yeah the the point here is just that if

263
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,380
if we go back and

264
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,720
go back to the notation where

265
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,339
uh

266
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,820
what we're we're representing by this

267
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,040
this simplified notation

268
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,940
is a

269
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,440
collection of

270
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,760
uh

271
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,420
cone cocone diagrams

272
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,019
and if the if the

273
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,079
if these reference frames commute

274
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,399
then

275
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,880
one can take these two diagrams

276
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,440
and

277
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,380
and find a

278
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,980
uh think of it in the information inflow

279
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,500
Direction

280
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,680
uh there will always be a common

281
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,600
uh Co

282
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,519
cone

283
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,300
over the two sets of

284
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,660
input classifiers

285
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,959
if the two qrfs commute

286
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,740
so what that means is that I go from a

287
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,279
diagram with two sets of of classifiers

288
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,779
each going up to some Apex

289
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:31,380
to a diagram with the merge set of

290
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,440
classifiers going up to some

291
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,160
some farther up the hierarchy Apex

292
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,980
because they commute I can find that

293
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,240
that

294
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,720
sort of yet more abstract cocone that

295
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,760
covers all of the classifiers in both

296
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,339
qrfs

297
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,940
so that just collapses

298
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,959
of these pairs of green segments down to

299
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,360
one green segment and I've drawn it the

300
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,579
same size I mean it would it would make

301
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,800
more sense graphically I suppose to draw

302
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,399
it right each one is twice as big or as

303
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,279
each one is the area

304
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,820
but yeah keeping to this kind of very

305
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,220
topological representation where the

306
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,120
area

307
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,540
isn't actually meaningful

308
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,279
um it is convenient to draw it this way

309
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,579
right

310
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:31,260
the fact that the commute means that you

311
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,300
will have that higher Apex in a way so

312
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,880
you can bypass that that first nesting

313
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,740
right but it comes to the number of

314
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,019
degrees of freedom the boundary uh

315
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,060
they're still the same and in terms of

316
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,880
their yeah right okay yeah we're not

317
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,740
we're not getting rid of any of the the

318
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,720
degrees of freedom of the boundary that

319
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,740
these uh curves are looking at

320
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,699
uh yeah very good so the next slide

321
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:59,100
um I found a very interesting one so

322
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,980
these are no growth theorems things that

323
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,279
Alex and Bob cannot do and they may you

324
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,779
know it's mainly having to do about

325
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,240
measuring their own entangled I meant

326
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,019
entropy and Counting degrees of freedom

327
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:13,860
um

328
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,100
I guess uh this has uh a very

329
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,680
holographic feel to it and also maybe

330
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,620
even a bit of a godo theorem feel to it

331
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,480
so I don't know if Chris wants to

332
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,139
comment on that

333
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,320
well I'll just say that I I think this

334
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,600
does have a kind of

335
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,220
how

336
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,060
girdle undecidability feel to it and

337
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,160
that there there are a large number of

338
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,699
questions that Alice can't answer

339
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:48,660
which uh certainly suggests a

340
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,260
formulation in terms of incompleteness

341
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,560
and this is

342
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,600
the connection to girdle's theorem is

343
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,060
actually something that Jim glazebrook

344
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,480
and I are currently working on

345
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,480
um and hopefully we'll be able to make

346
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,820
that connection more precise

347
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,760
but the the point of these statements is

348
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,560
just to emphasize that

349
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,160
um

350
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,100
a single Observer

351
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,880
that's uncompartmentalized

352
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,899
cannot uh determine anything about the

353
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,940
entanglement entropy of the environment

354
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,000
and this is this is just the result that

355
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,019
to to measure entanglement you have to

356
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,420
have you have to employ a lot protocols

357
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,620
so you have to have classical

358
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,720
communication

359
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,220
and

360
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,699
this

361
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:49,440
raises of

362
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,680
a fundamental issue in the theory and

363
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,699
that that I'll classical communication

364
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,440
is

365
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,259
an exchange of information

366
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,699
that

367
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:07,099
cannot be represented as a single

368
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:11,280
Quantum process you know hence

369
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,459
you have language like the collapse of

370
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,040
the wave function or these various other

371
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,520
uh you know deed coherence etc etc these

372
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,439
various ways of trying to capture this

373
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,720
idea that

374
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,059
something different and irreversible is

375
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,500
happening

376
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,480
as soon as you talk about classical

377
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,940
communication

378
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,260
so

379
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,980
uh

380
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,020
the point is for for Alice to measure

381
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,820
anything about the entanglement entropy

382
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,480
of Bob she has to be sectored

383
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,580
uh so her entanglement entropy has to

384
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,200
decrease

385
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,080
but she can't know that she can't

386
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,419
actually know that she has sector

387
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,640
compartments when we think of Alice as

388
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,500
an entire system

389
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,640
so

390
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,919
from now on

391
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,840
we're going to be talking about

392
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,539
the very limited points of view of

393
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,820
particular Observers

394
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:20,100
and to to talk about that I think it's

395
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,980
it's very important to keep these

396
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,620
various limitations in mind

397
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,820
because there's a real

398
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,260
distinction between

399
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,140
what we can say

400
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,620
uh effectively

401
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,559
from this kind of God's eye point of

402
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,480
view that we're adopting as theorists

403
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,000
where we say uh

404
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,919
Alice has

405
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,600
sectors that are communicating

406
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,520
classically

407
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,900
and

408
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,299
uh what

409
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,480
Alice A system can do from her point of

410
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,440
view

411
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,760
or

412
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,299
uh her sectors can do from their points

413
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,539
of view this is a distinction that's

414
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,660
often ignored but it's important to keep

415
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,200
it in mind

416
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,460
awesome thanks for this lion

417
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,480
enter

418
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,280
yeah so

419
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,000
before we continue

420
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,299
um

421
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,780
so then uh I guess if we get to the the

422
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,940
proper material of of the last lecture

423
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,860
which is what happens when you have

424
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,000
sectors

425
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,020
that are not commutative such as two

426
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,580
portions of this involved that have to

427
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,780
communicate classically

428
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,700
this this is what requires the classical

429
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,740
communication tick

430
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,799
um

431
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,020
let me see uh

432
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,400
so it would be fair to say Chris uh this

433
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,039
only such a classical Channel which is

434
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,080
the one shown in this uh slide requires

435
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,520
free energy

436
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,440
is that right because there's some

437
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,559
writing into a memory involved in here

438
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,059
compared to the earlier slide where we

439
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,280
had that closed loop in the entangled

440
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,039
picture there was no expenditure of

441
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,960
energy is that correct

442
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,100
right

443
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,419
right so so here the the the example

444
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:34,620
that came to mind here is

445
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,380
um exactly the process that we're that

446
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,260
we're executing right now

447
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,640
um

448
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,299
Alice has two components

449
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,940
um and and we are currently in the

450
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,520
position of those components

451
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,039
and we're communicating classically with

452
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,380
each other

453
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,340
by uh employing a channel that's part of

454
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,799
our shared environment

455
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,120
so we're acting

456
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,720
irreversibly on our shared environment

457
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,600
and

458
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,240
it's that irreversible action on the

459
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,039
environment that has the free energy

460
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,660
cost for each of us

461
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,900
we actually have to make noise

462
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,460
to communicate

463
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,340
and uh

464
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,000
you know our our laptops are actually

465
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,080
consuming power

466
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,840
all of this is classical I mean it's

467
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,600
this irreversible

468
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,039
irreversibility that defines

469
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,039
classicality

470
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,460
right and uh to continue with this

471
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,140
question I guess

472
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,840
uh it'll come in short in in later

473
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,640
slides but the other side of this lock

474
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,640
protocols is the Quantum Channel and my

475
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,760
question to you uh Chris is just like

476
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,520
there is an expenditure of time and

477
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,840
energy involved in this classical

478
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,940
Channel

479
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,039
this is the Quantum Channel basically

480
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,080
the opposite of that meaning it's it's

481
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,919
it's on it's action is instantaneous

482
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,200
entanglement presumably and also again

483
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,360
back to that Loop picture of the

484
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,419
entangle cycle uh is there just no

485
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,400
passage of time no expenditure of energy

486
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,780
is does that any of that make sense

487
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,539
uh yeah and I think it's worth actually

488
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,720
going to the next slide here where we

489
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,419
complete the loop and add the quantum

490
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:37,860
Channel

491
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,000
um

492
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,600
is it is it this one yeah

493
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,100
um

494
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,400
I think to to understand what's going on

495
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,360
here

496
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,000
I think it's very useful to think of it

497
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,860
in terms of uh of the lepr experiment

498
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,600
right where

499
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,380
um

500
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,940
Bob in this case the shared environment

501
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,059
includes the source that's creating the

502
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,039
entangled pair

503
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:12,720
which of A1 and A2 observe

504
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,000
simultaneously

505
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,500
they interact simultaneously with

506
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,720
their two detectors which are

507
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,880
interacting with the entangled pair so

508
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,039
you can think of their their two

509
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,940
detectors are entangled

510
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,039
and it's only later

511
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,960
that they exchanged this classical

512
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,640
information

513
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,700
and in a bell APR experiment

514
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,140
the

515
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,799
the time the elapsed time between the

516
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,500
source emitting the entangled pair

517
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,700
and the entangled pair interacting with

518
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,620
um

519
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,799
the detectors deployed by A1 and A2

520
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,760
is

521
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,760
is designed as part of the experimental

522
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,100
protocol to be less

523
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,200
than the time that it is required for A1

524
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,340
and A2 to communicate classically

525
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,640
and notice that from the point of view

526
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,580
of the entangled pair itself no time has

527
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,380
passed at all

528
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,940
right it's

529
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,419
the integral pair is

530
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:30,240
from a special relativity point of view

531
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,919
uh moving along a light light trajectory

532
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,480
so there's

533
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,419
uh there's no distance being traversed

534
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,360
in no time is is elapsing

535
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,340
from the point of view of the entangled

536
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,240
pair

537
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,600
uh there's only an elapsed time

538
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,840
and a Traverse distance in the

539
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,320
coordinates of The Observers

540
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,679
and it's those coordinates that Define

541
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,440
the parameters for the observer's

542
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,240
eventual classical communication

543
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,520
so that's this is why I characterize the

544
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,720
the Assumption of classical

545
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,780
communication as a stipulation

546
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,140
and also why I characterized it as a

547
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,559
fine-tuning assumption right we're

548
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,659
we're

549
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:27,299
assuming something very specific about

550
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,940
this communication Channel

551
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,200
uh and we're assuming that

552
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,460
the part of Bob the part of the shared

553
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,900
environment

554
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,900
that implements this classical

555
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,080
Communication channel

556
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,880
behaves differently from the rest of the

557
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,179
shared environment

558
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:55,860
it behaves in a way that is is classical

559
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,080
uh but the rest of the shared

560
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,000
environment doesn't

561
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,460
right the rest of the world is is

562
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,480
described using quantum theory so we're

563
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,419
we're making this assumption that part

564
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:12,539
of the shared environment is special

565
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:16,760
and the the specialness is that it it

566
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,960
behaves in this classical way

567
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,360
so let me let me finish with this uh

568
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,000
slide I suppose uh

569
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,220
to go back to my earlier question about

570
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,760
that entangled Loop being

571
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,440
at least rhetorically appears to be like

572
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,559
a degenerate version of this log picture

573
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,840
if in this lot of picture I have the

574
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,820
quantum channel on the right

575
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,980
uh that

576
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,980
hypothetical entanglement on the to

577
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,960
complete the cycle on the left was only

578
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,140
broken when A1 and A2

579
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,940
chose to write

580
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,980
that into their memories at different

581
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,500
sectors right and then that eventually

582
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,600
necessitated the classical communication

583
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,659
between them is that is that correct

584
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,340
yeah

585
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:05,940
um

586
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,279
you know one could

587
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,159
one could always take the point of view

588
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,179
of

589
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,580
uh if you will The Observer who's

590
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,220
outside the entire universe

591
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,059
and just sees the entire universe

592
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:23,640
evolving unitarily

593
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,360
and in from that point of view there's

594
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,179
no such thing as classical communication

595
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:33,720
so the communication is classical only

596
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,260
only relative to this division between

597
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,620
The Observers

598
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,179
and that division between The Observers

599
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:48,360
corresponds to their their measurement

600
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,900
procedures not commuting

601
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:56,039
so it it corresponds to what we think of

602
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,539
classically

603
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:02,820
as Alice acting on her half of the

604
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,679
entangled state

605
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,460
uh determining what Bob will then see

606
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,940
again that's that all of that causal

607
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,100
language is classical

608
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,260
right

609
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,720
uh and we're like at 11 30 so halfway

610
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,179
more or less let's say a few words on

611
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,539
uh the later slide but still uh it's

612
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,179
getting profits and all of that

613
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,500
um

614
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,480
I guess before we before we start

615
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,100
talking about this which will take us

616
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,419
like

617
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,580
five to ten minutes at most would you

618
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,620
say if you a few words again about the

619
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,039
fine-tuning Assumption so uh I still

620
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,260
can't quite understand what it's meant

621
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,240
here that this whole classical

622
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,880
communication staff requires fine-tuning

623
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,360
okay I I think uh a way to think about

624
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,500
it

625
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,539
is

626
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,080
um

627
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,240
to

628
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,059
to think about what it means to say that

629
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,279
Alice and Bob are able to communicate

630
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,799
classically

631
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,059
um

632
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,120
what we're saying is that Alice and Bob

633
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,059
share some sort of language so when they

634
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,919
exchange their data

635
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,440
we can think of their data as as written

636
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,700
in some binary code in a data table

637
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,659
you know Alice says

638
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,200
I I set my instrument this way and I saw

639
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,380
this Spin and I I then set my instrument

640
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,720
this other way and I made this

641
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,919
observation

642
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,159
so Alice's data table or a1's data table

643
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,899
um is is just a a long table with two

644
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,659
entries in each row

645
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:04,919
one entry is

646
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,559
how the detector was adjusted and the

647
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,840
other entry is is what the value of the

648
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,059
spin was observed

649
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:14,700
and Bob's data table looks the same

650
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,520
and so they they share this information

651
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,820
or they share it with some third party

652
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,220
they they communicate it classically

653
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,620
and there are two aspects to that

654
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,580
classical communication one is that

655
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,260
up to classical noise

656
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:39,179
of their data tables don't change

657
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,360
when they share them

658
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,980
so uh they really are irreversibly

659
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,720
recorded they're not evolving in time

660
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,000
uh along with the rest of the universe

661
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,820
the other aspect is that we have to

662
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,820
assume that Alice and Bob mean the same

663
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,980
thing

664
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,779
uh

665
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,640
by

666
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,760
their their notations in these data

667
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,700
tables so that they can actually compare

668
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,919
them so that they can actually do the

669
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,419
statistics

670
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,820
and see if they've violated Bell's

671
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,320
inequality

672
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,779
so what that means is we have to assume

673
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:28,080
that they actually share a definition of

674
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,100
up

675
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,559
and that when they talk about changing

676
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,020
the settings on their instruments

677
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,120
they're talking about changing those

678
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,640
settings with respect to some shared

679
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,500
definition of up

680
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,200
and you know in a in a real experiment

681
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,779
that shared definition of up is provided

682
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,880
by the the Earth's gravitational field

683
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,440
or something like that

684
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,779
Earth's magnetic field

685
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:55,520
some shared environmental variable

686
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:01,260
so now it seems like oh

687
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,919
we have a situation in which Alice Alice

688
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,100
1 and LS2 should be entangled right

689
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,700
because they share this reference frame

690
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,500
that enables them to communicate

691
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,080
classically

692
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,399
but

693
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,980
they can't be entangled if they're going

694
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,419
to communicate classically

695
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,500
so

696
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,640
so we make an assumption

697
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,700
that in just this case

698
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,100
they share a reference frame but they're

699
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,899
not entangled

700
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:39,419
they're able they're able to communicate

701
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,640
classically while sharing the reference

702
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,720
rate

703
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,820
and

704
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,779
we can sort of wave our hands and say uh

705
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,120
they only share the reference frame up

706
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,399
to some measurement resolution or

707
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,200
something like that

708
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,640
but

709
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,120
despite the hand waving we're making a

710
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,100
very specific assumption

711
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,480
that

712
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,399
violates

713
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,679
oh

714
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,580
the fact that reference frame sharing uh

715
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,399
induces entanglement so that's the

716
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,620
fine-tuning assumption

717
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,220
we assume that the universe is such that

718
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:24,899
in this very specific kind of case

719
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,360
uh we can have reference frame sharing

720
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,439
without entanglement

721
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,860
let's let's keep it here and just open

722
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,460
it up a little bit if um Harris or Dean

723
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,620
want to just get any thought or

724
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,840
reflection on what we've gotten to so

725
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,080
far

726
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:51,899
Paris if you want to please

727
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:55,980
yes everything is very interesting

728
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,519
um basically I was listening

729
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,760
with great let's say focus it reminded

730
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,880
me this let's say elaboration on the

731
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,239
previous talk that Chris gave two weeks

732
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,460
ago it reminded me something that

733
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,199
Michael Levin said some time ago

734
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,020
it is regarding this amazing ability of

735
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,080
uh cognition to scale up

736
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,739
so it's not only

737
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:28,199
this understanding let's say of the

738
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,839
scattering of cognition but also the

739
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:34,918
scaling up of cognition and when I try

740
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,760
to get inside in my head

741
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,000
actually that

742
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,359
asked Chrisette in in one of his talks

743
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,139
that if a system is a toggle one cannot

744
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:53,540
draw a meaningful boundary across it so

745
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,560
these fine fine tuning let's say

746
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,080
elaboration that was made

747
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,560
right now actually helps me understand

748
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,660
that even better so thank you Chris for

749
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,420
that and thank you under for this

750
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,420
collaboration

751
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,380
well thank you thank you I'm glad that

752
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,859
helped

753
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,420
yeah I I think this is intimately

754
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,220
related to

755
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:28,578
the question of what cognition is

756
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:30,060
oh

757
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,880
since if if we have a if we have a

758
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,920
purely Quantum system

759
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,040
there there really is a deep sense in

760
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,680
which nothing is happening because of

761
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,720
the time symmetry

762
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,140
so to talk about cognition is something

763
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,780
that actually occurs

764
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,760
uh we have to think of it classically

765
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,579
thank you also if you allow me another

766
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:02,579
comment on that and basically one of the

767
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:07,140
comments posted during your last talk in

768
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,060
the chat had to do with classical

769
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,359
memories and I was thinking about that

770
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:14,460
and I I came to the conclusion that

771
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,859
classical memories presupposes a

772
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,300
gestation period

773
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,200
and and when I think that about it that

774
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,599
actually makes sense and it is true

775
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,320
let's say uh for for both physical and

776
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,099
psychological reasons so uh for example

777
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,320
a hard disk needs to write data on its

778
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,140
magnetic surface and a human brain needs

779
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,720
to consolidate all those neural

780
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,300
connections through

781
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,720
synaptic plasticity let's say however

782
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,780
when we start thinking about quantity

783
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,300
Quantum information

784
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,460
and Quantum

785
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,859
Quantum memories let's say we realize

786
00:36:55,859 --> 00:37:00,599
that such memories will be such Quantum

787
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:03,660
memories basically will be stored in

788
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,119
qubits or in those and toggle states

789
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,760
that you described so the end do not

790
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,720
necessarily have the same limitations

791
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,420
and of course

792
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,460
Quantum information theories suggests as

793
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,099
I understand it that Quantum memories

794
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,460
can be created and accessed

795
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,119
instantaneously without any form of

796
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,800
gestation let's say without any

797
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,920
gestation period and of course this goes

798
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,920
back and it has the potential as I see

799
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,040
to revolutionize computation with in

800
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,859
terms of quantum Community computation

801
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,119
but also and most importantly

802
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:47,060
communication and and Quantum

803
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,160
cryptography even and this is something

804
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,960
that I

805
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,980
I am truly interested

806
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:01,099
so yeah I just wanted to share also that

807
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,900
[Music]

808
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,920
yeah that's that's a very good point

809
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,640
um

810
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,839
and the the flip side is

811
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,720
the the issue of stability

812
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,079
which again gets to the notion of of

813
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,260
Environmental decoccurrence

814
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,579
which is just the process of observation

815
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:30,060
of the quantum state by uh some

816
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,000
environment or some Observer some

817
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,720
component of its environment

818
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,560
and uh the reason this is a problem in

819
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,119
practice is that we don't have complete

820
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,339
control of all components of the

821
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:49,320
environment

822
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,520
right

823
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,760
uh so

824
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,420
we have to use things like liquid helium

825
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,020
to try to keep the environment at Bay to

826
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,720
prevent decoherence

827
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,839
uh because any other components of the

828
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:09,839
environment interacting with our Quantum

829
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,240
memory will alter the state of the

830
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,540
memory

831
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,180
yeah that is uh that is a great

832
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,619
ingredients

833
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:25,920
and basically the reason why I type that

834
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,560
question regarding

835
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,400
super selection rules and namely I

836
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,440
propose something called fuzzy super

837
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,440
selection rules

838
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,780
basically as I understand those super

839
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,420
selection rules the classical let's once

840
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,640
let's say they are based on symmetries

841
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,420
or on on all those conversation laws

842
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,339
they'll actually limit the accessibility

843
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:53,820
over there our capacity to to measure

844
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,660
let's say certain Quantum properties

845
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,540
let's say maybe it's parity maybe it's

846
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,680
angular momentum maybe it's even charged

847
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,900
but if we if we start thinking like uh

848
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,260
this fuzzy super selection rules

849
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,900
in an effort to relax these restrictions

850
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,040
by allowing some degree of coherence or

851
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,500
interference between the different super

852
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,339
selected sectors which can be a

853
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:25,260
Quantified let's say by a parameter

854
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,260
called fossils I know that in other

855
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,720
words like in my field that is fuzzy

856
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Cooperative mapping the production of

857
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,180
fastiness

858
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,640
from us as it was propounded by

859
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,280
Professor lotfi is that it actually

860
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,000
helped a lot of our models to become a

861
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,359
more accurate let's say so this is uh

862
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:51,480
what I am proposing maybe of course I I

863
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,900
don't expect it to

864
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,160
revolutionize Quantum information but

865
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,200
maybe it can help us understand a bit

866
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,500
better what is going on in the role of

867
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,140
this the coherence that comes out of the

868
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,260
environment so if we incorporate it as a

869
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,900
parameter of fuzziness a priori then

870
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,740
maybe can understand and even

871
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,459
what we are dealing with

872
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,859
uh yeah

873
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:20,880
um

874
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,160
I I would refer you to the paper Vibe

875
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,560
Bartlett

876
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,780
um two or the other there are two other

877
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,820
co-authors

878
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,920
in 2007

879
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,099
uh a lovely review of quantum reference

880
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,800
frames in reviews of modern physics

881
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,320
and a point that they make that I think

882
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,119
is relevant here

883
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,700
is that a super selection rule

884
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,900
can always be interpreted

885
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,359
let me see if I if I I'm not sure I'll

886
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,339
be able to completely reproduce their

887
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:00,660
argument

888
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,839
but they showed that a super selection

889
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,599
rule can always be interpreted as the

890
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,359
absence of a reference frame or the the

891
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,780
lack of a reference frame

892
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,420
and one of the examples that they give

893
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,700
is

894
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,619
um charge conservation

895
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,599
that we never see

896
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,240
uh

897
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,380
superpositions of different electric

898
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,660
charges

899
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,579
and uh their point is we never see this

900
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:35,400
because we have no way of measuring it

901
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,980
we have no reference frame

902
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,400
that we could use

903
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:47,240
that would allow us to see a state of of

904
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,520
superposed charges

905
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,400
and effectively what they're saying is

906
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,099
our reference frames are all made of

907
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,339
matter

908
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:04,500
that uh is is that is composed of stuff

909
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,740
that has well-defined electric charges

910
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,240
so we can't we can't see things that are

911
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,859
superpositions of charge and it's very

912
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:16,140
difficult you know for us to see things

913
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,619
that are super positions if positioned

914
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:22,339
so

915
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:25,020
this question of

916
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,240
what

917
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,300
is a super selection rule why do we have

918
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,220
these rules

919
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,560
at least in their reasoning

920
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,380
boils down to the question of why do we

921
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,540
have some

922
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,060
reference frames or sun measurement

923
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,520
capabilities and not others what is it

924
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,440
about us

925
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,000
that

926
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,119
limits in some fundamental way our

927
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,180
ability to make measurements

928
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,520
and

929
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,819
I suspect that when you talk about

930
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:04,560
fuzziness which is a sense of of

931
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,619
classical uncertainty

932
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,099
that you may be

933
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:12,359
um

934
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:15,060
sort of pointing in that direction

935
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,740
but I think I think it would be worth

936
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,140
looking at that paper and

937
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,960
which is which is largely written in

938
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,740
English right the the formalism is oh

939
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,339
wow

940
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,680
so it's a it's a very nice paper

941
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,680
okay thank you

942
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,260
for sure thank you

943
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,020
um Andrew maybe mute a little bit Dean

944
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,359
on the Mountaintop

945
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,339
what can you throw down on us

946
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,920
everything super special throw down I I

947
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,800
have a I have a question though and

948
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,020
because I am very comfortable in that

949
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,900
fuzzy space I kind of see relationships

950
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,220
as

951
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,500
uh and their and their lack of

952
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,800
definability as a feature so here's my

953
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,599
here's kind of my question

954
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:13,619
um

955
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:15,660
so you talked about a minimum sort of

956
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,980
two different memories to encode

957
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,020
something a time and I think it's it was

958
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,579
one of the slides just after the one

959
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:22,859
that's up here right now

960
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:24,839
which sounds to me like somewhere

961
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:27,300
processing capacity it sounds like we

962
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,400
are kind of stepping back

963
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,800
and trying to look at this instantaneous

964
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,359
thing

965
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,060
from the relative position of even the

966
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,640
things that are classical can be seen as

967
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,400
all Quantum so that when you mentioned

968
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,319
that earlier Chris that helped me quite

969
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:45,119
a bit

970
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,160
which then manifests itself as a

971
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,200
classical ability to process somewhere I

972
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,160
I spent a lot of my career

973
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,440
self-labeling as a wayfinder

974
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,440
so not capacity realization relationship

975
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:03,540
just as a relationship it means that

976
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,660
wave binding is not just an orienting or

977
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,300
a processing where I am

978
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,819
and being gripped by the sort of the

979
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,280
things I'm enveloped by it's also the

980
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,260
channel the screen the bound the divide

981
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,680
the Gap the unentangled potentiator

982
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,260
it's the thing upon which traction can

983
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,500
exist as being a gripper as well

984
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,900
so if it's

985
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,960
I was already hung up on I wanted to go

986
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,359
back like Colombo in that old 70s TV

987
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,359
show and talk about z-spin because I

988
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:38,880
think z-spin is an energy way of

989
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,700
describing but I honestly think when I

990
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,800
went back and watched the your

991
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,839
presentation a couple of times I'm

992
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,460
starting to get a sense

993
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,220
that z-spin is also relationship it's

994
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,540
that affordance

995
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,960
that allows us to be able to see up and

996
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,740
down but I'm just curious Chris are we

997
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,420
really talking about

998
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,280
processing somewhere in the classical

999
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,480
sense

1000
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,420
but because we have these two ways of

1001
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,300
encoding different memories we're also

1002
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,819
talking about somewhere processing just

1003
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:12,920
that

1004
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,900
that state that allows for

1005
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,599
that that's my my question is that what

1006
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,940
we're really getting are we are we

1007
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,859
trying to open that up that possibility

1008
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:25,160
up

1009
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:32,099
uh yeah I I think that's a nice way to

1010
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,500
think about it

1011
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,180
um

1012
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,560
I think we're trying to at some deep

1013
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,760
level

1014
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,619
uh

1015
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:47,099
come up with a way of describing

1016
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:49,760
what it means to be

1017
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,440
an agent

1018
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,859
uh and I'll say in our our case of

1019
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,260
self-conscious agent

1020
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,760
uh with a sense of time

1021
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,900
that's embedded in an environment

1022
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,700
that we depend on to store memories for

1023
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,020
us

1024
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:18,540
and what I what I mean by that is that

1025
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,359
we we depend on

1026
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,579
the environment

1027
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:25,200
to

1028
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,740
change very slowly at least from our

1029
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,319
point of view

1030
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:33,780
so that we can

1031
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,660
keep some sense of our orientation

1032
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,240
within the environment

1033
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,000
right we're using

1034
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,740
everything we see as a memory

1035
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,760
that allows us to keep our

1036
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,700
ourselves fixed which allows us to have

1037
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,980
a point of view

1038
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,220
so we're we're using the entire visible

1039
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,640
environment as if you will a reference

1040
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,680
frame

1041
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,800
uh against which we can see small

1042
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,780
changes

1043
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,359
but if the environment was constantly

1044
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:16,380
changed constantly and rapidly changing

1045
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,079
we wouldn't be able to do that and we

1046
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:19,920
wouldn't

1047
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,560
be able to use it as a memory and so we

1048
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,140
would have no point of view

1049
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,140
so in a sense I think what we're talking

1050
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,720
about here is the

1051
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,700
um

1052
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,180
kind of of the the miracle of having a

1053
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,460
point of view that gives us a sense of

1054
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,700
time

1055
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,540
that's very philosophical that

1056
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,319
it's it's amazing and I wonder if along

1057
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:55,880
with the perspectival visual

1058
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,500
advancements which you and Shannon

1059
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,660
Dobson have explored in the math art

1060
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,660
settings

1061
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,420
you're almost bringing that kind of a

1062
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,700
transformative re-understanding or

1063
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,640
re-quantum reference framing

1064
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,800
into a temporal

1065
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,859
setting where it's not just a static

1066
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,079
spatial parallax

1067
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,079
that we are

1068
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:22,700
aesthetically and formally

1069
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,060
re-understanding but also a temporal one

1070
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:30,200
which in an agent environment system

1071
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,220
necessitates these questions of

1072
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,660
communication

1073
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,640
which in the quantum information

1074
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,920
formalism are approached topologically

1075
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,920
rather than geometrically which is what

1076
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,859
we needed for the kind of vanishing

1077
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,420
point type

1078
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:50,059
math art in the spatial setting

1079
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,220
well I think their their approach

1080
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,980
geometrically eventually and and that's

1081
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,980
really what the the session in September

1082
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,680
will be about it's how to how to start

1083
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,880
with this

1084
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,319
very topological picture

1085
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,540
where we're only talking about

1086
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,460
uh

1087
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,619
interactions

1088
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:15,240
of

1089
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,640
in a sense

1090
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,680
interactions and time but but outside of

1091
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,819
space

1092
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:23,700
and layer of spatial structure on top of

1093
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,380
that

1094
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,579
and this is

1095
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,380
I I think this is particularly

1096
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,420
interesting in this active inference

1097
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,579
context because

1098
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:37,559
yeah

1099
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:39,780
it immediately raises biological

1100
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,119
questions about

1101
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:42,720
um

1102
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,099
the

1103
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:46,559
the ability of different organisms to

1104
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,740
layer space on their experience and

1105
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,160
hence locate themselves if you will

1106
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,379
within some sort of of perceived world

1107
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:03,420
awesome Dean and then back to Andre for

1108
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,900
the last minutes

1109
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:13,399
and then please continue

1110
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:17,280
sorry so Chris is it from the from the

1111
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,000
pure neophyte perspective that I have is

1112
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,059
it okay to say that it's not just

1113
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:27,359
a flipping of of position of words that

1114
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,240
somewhere processing that availability

1115
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,400
and processing somewhere in the

1116
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,819
classical sense where am I it's the it's

1117
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,579
our ability to fuse those as you

1118
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:41,640
mentioned we can we can slow down we can

1119
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,000
stabilize we can see that relationship

1120
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,339
or is it about spin

1121
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,460
I think the former

1122
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,380
rights spin is a very convenient

1123
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,119
abstraction for talking about

1124
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:12,119
binary encoding

1125
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,760
and we have this felt sense of spin but

1126
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,599
the the sense it's it's use in physics

1127
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,180
is very much an abstraction I mean the

1128
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,099
difference between a proton and neutron

1129
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:29,599
is a spin variable

1130
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:37,319
awesome under you can in last minutes

1131
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:40,579
take it where you need

1132
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,680
also on mute and continue

1133
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,359
can you guys hear me now

1134
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,880
well so let's uh hope that I have a time

1135
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,339
for Chris to address a couple things so

1136
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:56,099
just to conclude the slides

1137
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,200
um and then hopefully we get to say a

1138
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,420
few words on Quantum Darwinism so

1139
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,119
towards the end the slides

1140
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,579
um appear to start pivoting towards the

1141
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:09,000
next subject which is space on time

1142
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,660
and here in particular we see the

1143
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:17,160
earlier slide uh showcasing the log

1144
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,859
protocol where you can you can you can

1145
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:22,260
notice that half of it has been cut

1146
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,660
and that has has been moved to the

1147
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,119
Future so here we don't have uh two

1148
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,859
sectors of power let's communicating but

1149
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:30,420
rather Alice communicating with its

1150
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,319
future

1151
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:33,359
still you have the classical and the

1152
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,059
quantum Channel now one question that I

1153
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:37,520
brought up I remember

1154
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,640
and uh in in the lecture and maybe we

1155
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,280
can expand on a little more was

1156
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,559
exactly what is the difference between

1157
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,839
this Quantum and the classical Channel

1158
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:50,280
part

1159
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,040
um something I heard Chris say is that

1160
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,839
it is crucial for the quantum channel to

1161
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:57,180
be coherent so this is going to be some

1162
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,780
sort of unitary scattering Evolution

1163
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:02,280
that is

1164
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,020
completely independent of everything

1165
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,400
else going on

1166
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,280
uh is that correct or should be in

1167
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,579
theory

1168
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:16,619
and ask yes yeah and and I suppose just

1169
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:18,540
like earlier the classical the classical

1170
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:22,740
channel is is the part that takes time

1171
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:26,880
and free energy expenditure now uh my

1172
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,480
question uh to you Chris is

1173
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,599
on no no not the not the channels in the

1174
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,640
middle but the ticks on either side of

1175
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,020
the boundaries that have been broken

1176
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,579
down and separated

1177
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:41,460
in terms of an external time what's

1178
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,380
what's up with those ticks from one

1179
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,720
sector to the other of the boundary so

1180
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,119
in q1 for example the allow the lower

1181
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:51,900
CRF sector that's that amount to a state

1182
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,559
was prepared the upper one was I made a

1183
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:57,300
memory record of that state is that

1184
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,819
that's what it is right

1185
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:00,839
yeah

1186
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:04,619
okay so uh in in the lower sector we

1187
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:05,819
both had

1188
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:08,579
a preparation and a measurements and a

1189
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:10,079
measurement was recorded classically

1190
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,579
here

1191
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:14,099
that's all there is

1192
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:17,280
yeah so so preparation and measurement

1193
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,680
are are effectively the same process

1194
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:26,040
um and you can think of uh

1195
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,280
in A1 of t

1196
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,220
what A1 is doing

1197
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:36,319
is uh

1198
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,760
from from an operational point of view

1199
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,000
uh she's

1200
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,780
preparing an instrument

1201
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,339
and turning it on

1202
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:55,140
she's she's creating an initial state

1203
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,520
and she's simultaneously

1204
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:02,579
encoding a memory someplace

1205
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:03,540
um

1206
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:07,380
in her head or or on a piece of paper of

1207
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:12,240
what does Preparation conditions were

1208
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,780
because it's only with respect to the

1209
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,280
memory of what the preparation

1210
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,260
conditions were

1211
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:24,619
that the later measurement is Meaningful

1212
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:26,579
so

1213
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:27,420
um

1214
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,200
to let's let's go back to just preparing

1215
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,700
a spin

1216
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:36,540
uh right in at T

1217
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:40,260
she may uh

1218
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,780
set the angle of some polarization

1219
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,980
filter

1220
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,700
that defines a propagating beam of

1221
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,319
photons

1222
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:53,400
and at t plus delta T she measures

1223
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,380
something about what those photons are

1224
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,599
doing but the measurement is only

1225
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,980
meaningful with respect to her memory

1226
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:05,520
of what the polarization setting that

1227
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,780
prepared the photons was

1228
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,480
so the

1229
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,220
effectively what's going on in the

1230
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:18,540
quantum channel is an experiment

1231
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,240
and it's

1232
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,559
it's

1233
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,280
the the classical information that's

1234
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,619
preserved in this classical channel that

1235
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:30,480
makes the experiment meaningful or

1236
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,020
interpretable or informative yeah for

1237
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,420
sure yeah that makes perfect sense and

1238
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,700
and preparation of measurement this dies

1239
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,099
back to an earlier question we had what

1240
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:42,960
both happened simultaneously at the same

1241
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,460
like

1242
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,880
um uh degree of Freedom At The Boundary

1243
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,980
or do we have preparation at the lower

1244
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:53,040
bounds are the top of one the only

1245
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,480
reason you

1246
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,160
so

1247
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,880
yeah when when can one can think of that

1248
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,799
operator Mi if you remember the

1249
00:59:03,799 --> 00:59:06,960
decomposition of the hamiltonian as as

1250
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,359
preparing or measuring that it's just a

1251
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,040
matter of interpretation

1252
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,339
uh you know effectively is it acting to

1253
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:17,720
the left or acting to the right

1254
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:20,599
yeah okay yeah yeah yeah

1255
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,260
and then

1256
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,720
um before we get to quantumeric person

1257
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,540
that's uh more of a spatial instead of

1258
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:30,599
attack theme I wanted to ask uh yet

1259
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:32,339
another question between this one on my

1260
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:35,940
classes so the quantum channels thus

1261
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,440
involves some sort of

1262
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,420
Time Revolution you know it's this

1263
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,500
unitary

1264
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,680
you know portion that is uh sorry this

1265
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,680
portion that is evolving unitarily with

1266
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,660
no interference from the outside

1267
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,559
uh however as you said for this

1268
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:53,579
experiment to make sense you need to

1269
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:57,299
have a classical memory of of that

1270
00:59:57,299 --> 01:00:00,299
experiment most prepared plus that means

1271
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:03,359
that that classical guy on top is uh

1272
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:06,780
aesthetic there's no time flowing it

1273
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:10,440
uh well this actually gets back to the

1274
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,119
talk by suskin that we were talking

1275
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:15,299
about before we started here uh that you

1276
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:17,819
you kindly referred me to

1277
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:19,559
um

1278
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:24,000
part of part of this classical memory

1279
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,940
is uh

1280
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:30,599
memory for what counts as a classical

1281
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:32,640
clock

1282
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,619
and we'll we'll actually get to this

1283
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:36,720
again in the September session

1284
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,700
but if you if you think again about

1285
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,380
doing an experiment

1286
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,319
uh in which a state is prepared and then

1287
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:44,819
it's measured

1288
01:00:44,819 --> 01:00:49,079
uh this Quantum process is a process

1289
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,299
Through Time

1290
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:54,079
with respect to some

1291
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:57,660
uh classical clock

1292
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:00,299
that actually provides the time

1293
01:01:00,299 --> 01:01:03,720
coordinate for the experiment

1294
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,040
so

1295
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,900
this

1296
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:10,220
this classical clock is some

1297
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,799
external reference frame

1298
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:15,660
that

1299
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:20,220
that A1 here in this notation is is

1300
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:25,399
using as part of her classical memory

1301
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:29,400
right again uh it's a Memory because

1302
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,619
it's something that's assumed not to

1303
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:33,380
change

1304
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,640
and and this is

1305
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,980
this will be kind of the heart of the

1306
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:41,040
discussion in September that that time

1307
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:45,000
and memory and object persistence are

1308
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,940
all different names for this same

1309
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,859
assumption that we make about the world

1310
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,460
um

1311
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,099
thank you Chris

1312
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:01,200
thank you I I am going to have to

1313
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,000
disappear so

1314
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,819
um only for now though

1315
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:08,880
yeah only for now I I will I will

1316
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,940
nonetheless persist someplace

1317
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,500
thank you Chris

1318
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,359
come on Chris okay awesome

1319
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:21,720
thanks very much well measure you later

1320
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,720
okay

1321
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,780
um enter if you wanted to

1322
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:30,420
drop any other

1323
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:34,740
cues or clues or

1324
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,140
bring us a little bit of a preparation

1325
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,480
for where we're going to be heading in

1326
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,680
lecture five that would be pretty cool

1327
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,440
uh sure so I mean I I'm a little aware

1328
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,780
of what's coming in lecture five

1329
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:49,619
um

1330
01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:53,160
until about uh space sometime and how

1331
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,520
space may be sorry time may be a little

1332
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,740
more fundamental than space for reasons

1333
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:01,380
that Chris will show

1334
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,059
um

1335
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:05,280
has a lot to do with the notion of how

1336
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,619
you define a clock as in we need to

1337
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:08,819
think hard

1338
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:12,000
about what what what are the verb

1339
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,220
minimum ingredients

1340
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:16,260
for you to talk about the existence of a

1341
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,599
clock uh these are deep fundamental

1342
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:20,460
almost philosophical questions that are

1343
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,819
overlooked and the good news and that's

1344
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:25,740
the sasking talk that Chris and I were

1345
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,260
referring to referring to is that other

1346
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,720
people especially in the high energy

1347
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,780
Community are also looking into these

1348
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,400
questions which is very reassuring so

1349
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,280
I'm talking

1350
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:41,280
uh Harlow Etc they are

1351
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,920
there's a recent talk on YouTube where

1352
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,180
they talk about

1353
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,980
what does it mean for something to be a

1354
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,740
clot you know how that's how long does a

1355
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,680
clock last and and then Chris will also

1356
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,180
talk about space

1357
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:57,240
and and the punchline of it will be

1358
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,460
that

1359
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,240
um

1360
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,400
there's obviously a physics approach to

1361
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,980
emerging space-time which is very very

1362
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,440
technical and and so on

1363
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,299
but

1364
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:12,000
from what I understood I mean I I have

1365
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,680
the interesting to talk my first my

1366
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,140
thoughts myself first

1367
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,359
um is that there is a parallel

1368
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:21,359
biological approach as to how we learn

1369
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,900
our space-time so from uh developmental

1370
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,359
psychology point of view

1371
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:28,440
um

1372
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,900
influence and I suppose all kinds of

1373
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,260
animals are not born uh fully equipped

1374
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:37,319
to perceive space-time hence the

1375
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:39,240
necessity of things like clay and so on

1376
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:43,140
so they can find correlations between uh

1377
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:46,440
motor inputs and visual inputs right and

1378
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,059
eventually things like the mirror test

1379
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:50,819
which is non-trivial no no no no no no

1380
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:53,099
human born is born

1381
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:55,920
uh passing the mirror test already

1382
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,660
so that implies that at least

1383
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:00,480
biologically it is non-trivial and it

1384
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,460
takes a few steps until you get to have

1385
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,020
that sort of

1386
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:08,040
a space spatial awareness right

1387
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,079
now the interesting part of this for me

1388
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,540
personally is with the with the physics

1389
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:17,040
side of it is and uh I I'm no expert by

1390
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,540
any means but I think the gist of it

1391
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,040
might might have to do something with

1392
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:24,119
Quantum error correction uh ads EFT and

1393
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,680
so on

1394
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,420
um there was a bit of a teaser about

1395
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:30,000
quantumeric correction here in this

1396
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,579
slides uh but yeah I mean that's that's

1397
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:34,500
about all I can say

1398
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,540
but very looking forward to the biology

1399
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,920
also

1400
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,599
yeah cool

1401
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,020
Harris any last thoughts or anything you

1402
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:46,079
want to point towards

1403
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,599
basically I would like to thank everyone

1404
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:50,339
for inviting me

1405
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:52,339
I really enjoyed it

1406
01:05:52,339 --> 01:05:54,559
the whole uh

1407
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,359
live stream

1408
01:05:56,359 --> 01:06:01,140
I hope we have made some progress

1409
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:04,040
and looking forward to

1410
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,780
the next

1411
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:10,880
live streams number five and number six

1412
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:16,099
so that's about it thank you everyone
