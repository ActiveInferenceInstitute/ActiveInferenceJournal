570	21306	1	A	0.99998	00:00	53	Hello. Welcome to the course physics as Information Processing. Taught by Chris Fields, with Aguirre Aguire as a course assistant. Hosted during 2023 by the Active Inference Institute, this video is an overview of the course website. It's going to cover some of the key pieces of the website and ways to participate.
21498	56190	2	A	1.0	00:21	85	The course homepage hosts the key links and a written course overview. On the course syllabus page there's a table with each row being one session. So here you can see the topic and the preparation for each of the six lectures. And you can see information about the six discussion sections which will be following each lecture by about two weeks. Each lecture and discussion, you can click this blue icon and go directly to the video to rewatch it or watch it live.

On the Questions and Answers page there's a form that you can submit. You can say what is time? And if you submit that question, we'll get it on the back end and Chris Fields will answer the question, and then the question and answer will come up to the public front end and along with the transcripts of all sessions, these questions and answers will be part of the publication that we prepare at the end of the course.

Lastly, you can go to register to join discussions. So if you want to join those live interactive discussion live streams, about two weeks after each lecture, you can complete this form and we'll add you to calendar events. So thanks again for your interest in the course Physics'information Processing and we hope to see see you either watching and rewatching the videos, asking questions and answers and maybe even registering to join the discussions.
