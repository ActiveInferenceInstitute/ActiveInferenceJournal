hello welcome to the course physics as

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,880
information processing taught by Chris

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,519
Fields with Andre Aguirre as a course

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,820

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,580
octave inference Institute this video is

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,160
an overview of the course website it's

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,080
going to cover some of the key pieces of

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,600
the website and ways to participate

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,199
the course homepage hosts the key links

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,019
and a written course overview

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,420
on the course syllabus page

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,660
there's a table with each row being one

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,000
session so here you can see the topic

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,219
and the preparation for each of the six

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,700
lectures and you can see information

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,680
about the six discussion sections which

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,899
will be following each lecture by about

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,640
two weeks

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,219
each lecture and discussion you can

20
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,219
click this blue icon and go directly to

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,680
the video to re-watch it or watch it

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,039
live or you can go to the playlist to

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,500
watch all videos sequentially

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,940
so that's one way that you can

25
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,939
participate is watching videos live or

26
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,380
re-watching them

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,200
on the questions and answers page

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,420
there's a form that you can submit you

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,220
can say what is time

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,619
and if you submit that question we'll

31
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,080
get it on the back end and Chris Fields

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,119
will answer the question and then the

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,460
question and answer will come up to the

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,159
public front end and along with the

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,320
transcripts of all sessions these

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,939
questions and answers will be part of

37
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,280
the publication that we prepare at the

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,920
end of the course so we heartily

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,740

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,000

discussions so if you want to join those

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,640
live interactive discussion live streams

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,060
about two weeks after each lecture you

46
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,759

thanks again for your interest in the

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,840
course physics is information processing

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,540
and we hope to see you either watching

51
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,699
