00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:00,926
Daniel: Hello.

2
00:00:01,027 --> 00:00:03,177
Welcome to the course physics as

3
00:00:03,177 --> 00:00:04,790
Information Processing.

4
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:07,341
Taught by Chris Fields, with Aguirre

5
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,036
Aguire as a course assistant.

6
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:11,274
Hosted during 2023 by the Active

7
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:14,531
Inference Institute, this video is an

8
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,760
overview of the course website.

9
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:18,968
It's going to cover some of the key

10
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:20,150
pieces of the website and ways to

11
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,228
participate.

12
00:00:21,247 --> 00:00:24,586
The course homepage hosts the key links

13
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:27,856
and a written course overview.

14
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,196
On the course syllabus page there's a

15
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:34,519
table with each row being one session.

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,751
So here you can see the topic and the

17
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:39,996
preparation for each of the six lectures.

18
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:39,002
.

19
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:41,288
And you can see information about the six

20
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:44,506
discussion sections which will be

21
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:46,784
following each lecture by about two weeks.

22
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:47,797
.

23
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:50,119
Each lecture and discussion, you can

24
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:53,401
click this blue icon and go directly to

25
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:56,698
the video to rewatch it or watch it live.

26
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:56,713
.

27
00:00:56,728 --> 00:00:59,003
Or you can go to the playlist to watch

28
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:00,591
all videos sequentially.

29
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:03,832
So that's one way that you can

30
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:05,085
participate is watching videos live or

31
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:07,205
rewatching them.

32
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:10,520
On the Questions and Answers page there's

33
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,709
a form that you can submit.

34
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:13,894
You can say what is time?

35
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:16,136
And if you submit that question, we'll

36
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:18,365
get it on the back end and Chris Fields

37
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:20,587
will answer the question, and then the

38
00:01:20,587 --> 00:01:23,816
question and answer will come up to the

39
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:25,021
public front end and along with the

40
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,220
transcripts of all sessions, these

41
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,460
questions and answers will be part of the

42
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,701
publication that we prepare at the end of

43
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:33,812
the course.

44
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:36,128
So we heartily encourage all questions

45
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:37,231
and answers.

46
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,437
It's a really easy and important

47
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:41,666
anonymous way for you to contribute.

48
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,976
Lastly, you can go to register to join

49
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:45,007
discussions.

50
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:48,031
So if you want to join those live

51
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:50,057
interactive discussion live streams,

52
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:53,085
about two weeks after each lecture, you

53
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:56,113
can complete this form and we'll add you

54
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:58,130
to calendar events.

55
00:01:58,131 --> 00:02:00,097
So thanks again for your interest in the

56
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:03,123
course Physics'information Processing and

57
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,147
we hope to see see you either watching

58
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:07,168
and rewatching the videos, asking

59
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,190
questions and answers and maybe even

60
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,216
registering to join the discussions.

61
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:14,232
Thanks and see you there.
