00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,418
Hello and welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:20,930
It's September 30, 2023, and we are in physics as information processing discussion five should be a fun discussion on a great 5th lecture.

3
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:40,438
So, Ander, if you'd like to give some opening remarks, and then also anyone else, whether it's your first time joining a discussion or not, it would be great to hear your remarks on lecture 5 or just where you're coming at it today.

4
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:42,270
So first though, Ander.

5
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,222
Sure.

6
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:45,418
Hello, Daniel.

7
00:00:45,594 --> 00:00:51,230
So I may as well start off by sharing the slides, right?

8
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,320
What do you think?

9
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,180
Sure.

10
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,580
So just before, as a warm up, let's review some of the things that Chris mentioned last time.

11
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:12,230
So near the beginning, the main thing was this distinction between reductionist and scale-free theories.

12
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:24,758
Obviously, one very salient feature of the free energy literature is that it falls under scale-free theories.

13
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:32,510
These are theories where there is no preferred scale of energy or distance.

14
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,706
Reductionist theories are based on such a scale existing.

15
00:01:39,738 --> 00:01:40,030
Right.

16
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,766
You want to break the pieces into the fundamental building blocks of the Legos.

17
00:01:44,958 --> 00:02:06,550
People think of usually high energy or particle physics as the archetype of this thing, whereas in scale-free theories, there is no such thing, and we should have the same skeletons or the same framework at different scales.

18
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,660
This is going to be very important.

19
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:30,874
Chris, correct me if I'm wrong, but especially for the coming lecture where we talk about biology, Chris himself made a few remarks on how the renormalization group flow, a.k.a, the process of going from smaller to higher scale, may be trivial in biology.

20
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:34,766
That is to say that there is a self similarity.

21
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:41,102
Okay, so some features of biology should remain invariant at different scales.

22
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:51,080
That is what cells are to a body, different individuals of a species might be to an ecosystem, that sort of idea.

23
00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:07,498
So after talking about scale, and perhaps when we get to the question parts, I guess this is the one thing that I would like Chris to explain a little more precisely what these diagrams mean.

24
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:11,774
I have a rough idea, but it would be nice to hear him talk about that again.

25
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:16,000
Anyways, in the second half, basically.

26
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:27,860
We started asking, as is the theme in this course, so far from first principles, what do you need to talk about space and time?

27
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:37,258
And there was some theorizing that time might be more fundamental.

28
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:41,698
That is, the things that you need to implement a clock.

29
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:46,050
We're thinking about what are the most basic constituents to implement a clock.

30
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:53,386
And those may be even more basic than the things you need to implement QRFs or perception of space.

31
00:03:53,568 --> 00:04:02,062
After all, it seems like you need some spatial extension to perceive a space in the first place.

32
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:09,040
I can't remember if it was somebody who was tuning in for the lecture or a question afterwards or something like that.

33
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,226
But I think this remark gets to a very deep point.

34
00:04:14,408 --> 00:04:20,334
Somebody I recall mentioned that some organisms, it might have been Chris himself I can't remember, really that there are organisms, you may know the name, Daniel, that are so tiny that if they try to implement a gradient, to try to chase their food or whatever, they're so small that they can't even perceive the gradient.

35
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:48,566
Any attempt at implementing such perception, they're going to feel the same amount of concentration in all directions.

36
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:51,166
So they're basically not large enough to perceive space.

37
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:55,342
However, interestingly, so, they can perceive time.

38
00:04:55,476 --> 00:05:02,186
I don't know how this ties to the remarks that Chris made about space being more fundamental.

39
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:09,410
I suppose Chris was getting at the point that you need fewer parts to perceive space.

40
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:19,350
And the fact that such small organisms can perceive time but not space, I guess, is further empirical evidence for this thesis.

41
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,342
Actually, Ander, if I can.

42
00:05:24,476 --> 00:05:25,190
Yes, please.

43
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,190
I may have botched the explanation.

44
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,258
Yeah.

45
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:37,386
I proposed earlier that time is actually more fundamental than space, that one has to have time to be able to see space.

46
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:40,410
So that's further on in these slides.

47
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,602
That issue is discussed.

48
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:43,440
Yeah.

49
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,150
Do you want to say something about that, Chris?

50
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, this is the right slide.

51
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,130
Yeah.

52
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:09,440
One just needs a memory, really, to have a clock, an external clock. To have an internal clock one also has to have a memory to have an internal clock.

53
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:32,120
But if you have a memory and there's some kind of activity that's periodic in the environment, then you have a clock, an external clock, but you don't need object identity to have a clock.

54
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,568
And that's what distinguishes it from space.

55
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:43,428
You have to have object identity, or in other words, motion, the ability to perceive motion, to perceive space.

56
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,430
Right.

57
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,584
Yeah.

58
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:55,320
Any periodic behavior is effectively a clock.

59
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:13,932
Whereas for space, we need object persistence, which...two comments that we've made...were that object persistence, or rather Chris made, is the defining feature of classicality.

60
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:15,056
You said that last time.

61
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:16,124
Is that right, Chris?

62
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:26,210
And also that object persistence is precisely the notion of thingness, the way Friston would put it.

63
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,168
Yeah, yeah.

64
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:39,124
Object persistence is definitely a classical notion, and it does seem to be the place where classicality enters quantum theory, as far as I can tell, is with this notion of object persistence; that's the most fundamental place that it enters.

65
00:07:48,960 --> 00:08:05,010
So how does that definition of, or rather, relationship between classicality and quantumness being object persistence, how does it compare with other accounts coming from QdaR (acronym? word?) and decoherence and all of that?

66
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,810
Well, say quantum Darwinism is a good example.

67
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,240
Quantum Darwinism assumes object persistence.

68
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:28,440
It assumes that there is some persistent thing that interacts over time with the environment according to some interaction that has fixed eigenvalues.

69
00:08:29,500 --> 00:09:14,150
So quantum Darwinism already assumes object persistence, and it also assumes classical communication, as we discussed a couple of times ago, in that it's a theory that is about the ability of multiple observers to agree about the state of some other object, which for them to agree about that object, not only does the object need to persist, the various observers need to have the same description of that object, or the same name for that object, or the same way of identifying that object.

70
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,440
So, yeah, Quantum Darwinism actually assumes a lot of classical features.

71
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:31,420
The basic theory of environmental decoherence is, in effect, a single observer theory.

72
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:44,856
So it doesn't have to assume classical communication, but it does assume object persistence, which obviously, if you're going to talk about empirical science, you have to.

73
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:52,060
You have to assume that your detector is a thing that persists through time, or you can't do an experiment.

74
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,710
And more importantly than that, you have to assume that you're a thing that persists through time.

75
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,820
So we need these classical notions to talk about doing science.

76
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,014
I'm not the first person to point that out, of course.

77
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:18,550
I mean, [Niels] Bohr pointed that out in 1928 in his paper in Science (or Nature?) [1928, The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory, Nature], where he summarizes quantum theory.

78
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,100
So it's a very old idea, right.

79
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:41,440
And I guess right away I have a question that I suspect I may have asked before, but maybe we can revisit it from the perspective of today's discussion, which is, and maybe I should pull the slide, this is actually from session 4.

80
00:10:42,450 --> 00:11:04,866
So if we're talking about differences between what the defining feature of classicality is, to me, that bears the question of here, right, this TQFT diagrammatic notation for the classical and the quantum channels.

81
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:23,718
So if we're talking about object persistence as the defining feature of classicality, and this is the cartoon picture of what goes on an EPR experiment, Chris, could you say maybe a few words about how the symmetry is broken between the quantum and classical channels?

82
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:32,318
I suspect it might have been mentioned that these are symmetrical, but yet one of the two has to be a quantum, and the other one is a classical channel.

83
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:39,410
The quantum channel mediates some sort of unitary evolution, is that correct?

84
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:50,426
Whereas the classical channel is like an information redundancy reservoir, which maybe has to do something with object persistence.

85
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:54,726
But I'm very much speculating at this point, so I'm not sure if Chris, you have any comments?

86
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:04,230
Yeah, well, an easy way to think about this, I think, is to actually think about a Bell EPR experiment where you have two observers that are separated in space.

87
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:18,270
You have to assume here to talk about Bell EPR, you have to assume the notion of space to have a laboratory reference frame in which the two observers are spatially separated.

88
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:35,300
And in that situation, then the two observers both independently collect data for some amount of time.

89
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:45,074
On multiple replicates of some quantum state that's produced by a source.

90
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:49,880
So you have pairs of photons or pairs of electrons or pairs of whatever.

91
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,490
And at some point, the data collection stops.

92
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,330
And at that point, the observers have to compare their results.

93
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:09,760
So it's the comparison step that requires a classical channel.

94
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:24,910
And if you think about how this happens, in practice, it happens via a file sent over to the Internet.

95
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:31,346
Or a piece of paper on which the data are written that's handed by one of the experimenters to the other experimenter.

96
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,738
Or it happens by the experimenters talking to each other.

97
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:47,980
So one experimenter encodes a bunch of information in the ambient air.

98
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,860
And the other experimenter hears it.

99
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,182
Or it can be communicated by light signals, right?

100
00:13:57,316 --> 00:14:00,270
But it's always communicated by some medium.

101
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:07,502
And that's what Defines classical communication.

102
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:17,010
It's communication via a Medium that persists through time in the observer's reference frame.

103
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:28,440
And the minimum time of the persistence of that medium is given by the speed of light.

104
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,454
So if the observers are a foot apart and they're communicating by a light signal, then it may only last a nanosecond.

105
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:46,030
But if they're talking to each other, it lasts several seconds.

106
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:55,390
And if they exchange a piece of paper, then that piece of paper may last for years in a lab notebook someplace.

107
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:03,700
So there's always the question of persistence over time that is deeply bound up with this notion of classicality as a process that takes time.

108
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,654
Information has to flow, has to be encoded in a medium,

109
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:39,870
And in a sense, we're assuming something like that in the quantum description when we think of this boundary via which the A and B, the physical components, interact.

110
00:15:53,730 --> 00:16:00,040
If we think of that boundary as a qubit array, then each of those qubits persist through time.

111
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,350
And that's what allows them to encode classical information, so encode observational outcomes that are repeated in time.

112
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:22,010
That's what allows them to serve as a memory, to encode information in a way that's thermodynamically irreversible.

113
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:31,520
And if you think of the boundary in that way as a qubit array, then it has a certain thickness in time.

114
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,090
It's two Planck times thick.

115
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:45,780
The Planck time is ten to the -43 seconds, so it's unmeasurably small.

116
00:16:46,470 --> 00:17:03,080
But the operation of interacting with a qubit is a physical interaction that, from a relativistic point of view, has to take this minimal time.

117
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:16,430
It's, in a sense, persistence for times that are significantly longer than the Planck time that is the marker of classicality here.

118
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:39,760
But even this Planck time...even persistence over the Planck time is a necessary ingredient for talking about communication, even quantum communication.

119
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:50,644
So it's a very, very deep concept with a very long philosophical history going back to the Ship of Theseus and all that.

120
00:17:50,762 --> 00:17:52,432
People have been wondering about.

121
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:55,610
What does it mean to say that something persists through time?

122
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:05,450
Does anyone want to make a comment on that or bring in a new question?

123
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,590
Please feel free to, if you haven't brought up anything yet.

124
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,790
Sure, I can speak more, if you don't mind.

125
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:34,980
I also recall, and Chris, correct me if I'm wrong, we said that, related to what you just said, that clock tick is always tantamount to one of these classical channels.

126
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,164
Is that correct?

127
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:38,260
Did I remember that correctly?

128
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,710
Chris?

129
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,940
Yeah.

130
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,890
An internal clock tick corresponds to an irreversible write on the boundary.

131
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,710
So one can then ask, what does it mean to say that that's irreversible?

132
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,600
What it means is it took some energy to do it.

133
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:29,290
And if you go back to read that bit again, there's at least a reasonably high probability that it still is in the same state that you wrote it in.

134
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:29,958
Right?

135
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:37,690
And clearly, that probability is going to degrade through time because that action is on the boundary.

136
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:47,582
So whatever you've written, whatever bits that you've written are now exposed to the environment.

137
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:52,770
So if Alice writes them, they're now exposed to Bob and to Bob's dynamics.

138
00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:10,780
So, as time goes on by your internal clock or any external clock, the probability of that memory being the same when you go back to read it, slowly decreases, or maybe it decreases fast.

139
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:32,180
And we know that from our own case, our own memories degrade through time, because the physical world is interacting with our brains in ways that we don't control, killing neurons or changing their activity or whatever.

140
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:48,040
So whenever we talk about memory, it's always with this caveat that the memory is exposed to the environment and it's not guaranteed to be the same.

141
00:20:48,890 --> 00:21:03,710
It's only kind of grace of the environment being reasonably benign that any of us have memories at all.

142
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:14,800
So this thermodynamic cost to classical information sharing or writing would it be fair to say that, in a sense, the price you have to pay to protect against decoherence, or entangling this sector with the rest of the environment just to preserve its identity?

143
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:34,230
Would that be fair to say?

144
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,312
Yeah, I mean, you can think of decoherence as a good thing, or you can think of decoherence as a bad thing.

145
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:40,970
Right.

146
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,800
If you're trying to preserve a quantum state, then it's a bad thing.

147
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:53,980
You have to spend energy to prevent decoherence by cooling everything down to milli-Kelvins.

148
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:11,280
But if you're interested in preserving classical data, then decoherence is a good thing, because it prevents your classical data from being completely rearranged by becoming entangled with the environment.

149
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:33,530
Think about trying to write classical memories using the states of atoms in the middle of the sun, and the temperature is so high that you can't do anything, you can't rearrange the atoms in any way and expect them to stay put.

150
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:41,608
So there you're in effectively a completely quantum environment just because of the high temperature, so it's a plasma.

151
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,490
Yeah.

152
00:22:48,560 --> 00:23:19,190
And then just one final question that popped to my mind, as you say this, and I can certainly leave it here for everyone else, so if we're trying to protect about, against random loss, against the loss of information, I suppose it really begs the question of what is the source of this noise that can perturb the bits in the boundary?

153
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,738
There's obviously this distinction between thermal and quantum noise.

154
00:23:26,914 --> 00:23:31,242
Again, it's a stretch to see if we can think back about the Wick rotation, about that.

155
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:54,930
But again, I recall earlier sessions where we talk about how the noise here in this quantum theoretic picture of information processing is coming from the QRFs failing to be aligned, then you hear about notions of quantum noise versus thermal noise.

156
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,340
Chris, do you have any comments on all of that?

157
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:11,160
Yeah, I think an important thing here...let me back up.

158
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:24,330
The notion of noise, like so many other notions, is very often treated as objective, as observer-independent.

159
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:35,230
And so when we're doing classical physics, we think of noise as know there's some objective randomness in the universe, and we call that noise.

160
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:45,234
So in this picture, because we're working with just a bipartite decomposition, right, we just have Alice and Bob, and that's it.

161
00:24:45,272 --> 00:24:47,010
That's the entire universe.

162
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:55,570
There's no external environment here to impose any sort of noise.

163
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:19,046
But since we only have two systems, Alice and Bob equals everything else--you know, not Alice--then, if we talk about Bob being a noisy environment, that's clearly relative to this boundary we've drawn between Alice and Bob.

164
00:25:19,238 --> 00:25:21,862
So noise isn't observer-independent.

165
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:28,400
What's noise for Alice is just Bob's dynamics.

166
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:57,350
If you think about where these systems come from, you've got some universe that is in some pure state, because it's an isolated system, and that state is evolving through time, which means it's just undergoing phase rotation.

167
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,740
So there's no noise in that system.

168
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:02,682
Right.

169
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:05,690
It's perfectly unitary, etcetera, etcetera.

170
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:17,440
As soon as you draw a boundary, then there's information that the system on one side of the boundary doesn't have about the system on the other side.

171
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:35,104
So the individual systems...their states...can now be considered conditionally independent.

172
00:26:35,152 --> 00:26:40,500
I mean, you can come up with a description in which their states are conditionally independent.

173
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:50,360
And that just means that what the other side is doing looks like noise unless Alice, say, can come up with a way of analyzing the data that she sees on her boundary in a way that makes it make sense, right?

174
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:08,924
And then we say it's information for Alice.

175
00:27:08,972 --> 00:27:10,240
But what does that mean?

176
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:18,290
It just means it's behavior on her boundary that she's smart enough to assign some kind of semantics to.

177
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,620
And if she's not smart enough to do that, then it's just noise.

178
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:39,210
So as soon as you make the notion of noise observer-dependent, it turns into something that makes a lot more sense.

179
00:27:44,862 --> 00:28:05,596
And just to really finish this, I guess it's been a couple of months at least, but I think it was back in July that we talked about the distinction between what you're saying, which is things having the appearance of noise, just because you have finite resources.

180
00:28:05,628 --> 00:28:16,832
So you cannot make sense of Bob's internal dynamics, as opposed to in that cartoon of the four possibilities for QRFs alignments.

181
00:28:17,226 --> 00:28:25,592
Some of them were thermal in the sense that one side was acting on a boundary qubits while the other one was not.

182
00:28:25,646 --> 00:28:30,250
So then it truly looks like noise to the other side.

183
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:38,044
Does that get to the bottom of the distinction between quantum and thermal noise at all, Chris, or am I misunderstanding things here?

184
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:45,492
Yeah, it turns the distinction into essentially a QRF-relative distinction.

185
00:28:45,576 --> 00:28:53,612
Language provides a good example.

186
00:28:55,222 --> 00:28:59,170
Think of going to someplace where you don't understand the language at all.

187
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,070
Papua New guinea or something like that.

188
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,060
I certainly wouldn't understand the language.

189
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:19,610
That language...the behavior of speaking that language encodes lots of information for those people and encodes no information at all for me.

190
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,312
So it looks like noise to me.

191
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:27,230
I can't make sense of it, but it's not noise from their point of view.

192
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:35,900
And now let's think about this need to have a thermodynamic sector.

193
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:55,300
If you're an organism that has to burn energy, or any system that has to burn energy to act irreversibly on your environment, that thermodynamic sector looks to you like noise.

194
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,820
It's just temperature, heat.

195
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:06,388
And you use that heat to drive your processing.

196
00:30:06,484 --> 00:30:16,760
And if you're a really good heat engine, then you can use it pretty efficiently and get a lot of bang for the buck in terms of information processing.

197
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:29,010
If you're a really inefficient heat engine, then maybe you have to use almost your entire environment as heat to do any little bit of information processing at all.

198
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,232
So that's not a statement about the universe as a whole.

199
00:30:35,286 --> 00:30:46,420
That's a statement about you and your information processing capabilities and your heat processing capabilities.

200
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,540
How good is your Carnot cycle determines the amount of information processing you can do.

201
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,724
Thank you, Chris.

202
00:30:58,852 --> 00:30:59,640
Ian.

203
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,650
Hi.

204
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,972
Yeah, thank you, everyone, for putting on this series.

205
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,920
It's the first time I've joined the discussion sessions.

206
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:34,040
So it's a question about, in one of the slides, there was a green rectangle, and we were talking about that being, or Chris was talking about that being, a kind of thinking of that as a bacterium.

207
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,010
And it got me wondering whether, how else I could get an intuitive grasp of this kind of spacetime emerging.

208
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:58,400
What I was thinking is, it appears like to us humans, it appears like the universe is expanding through time.

209
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:24,532
And I was just trying to think a bacterium. If you placed a single bacterium on a petri dish at time zero, or even something more simple, let's say deep sea hydrothermal vent, where life was supposed to...these agents were supposed to have maybe begun existing as phospholipid type molecules...

210
00:32:24,596 --> 00:32:49,276
So I was just wondering if I was a phospholipid within that bacterial membrane, just one single phospholipid, and all I can measure is the existence of "phospholipidness", or "not phospholipidness," and "selfness" or "not selfness"... then I was just trying to imagine--as this bacteria divides after 20 minutes, let's say, the average sort of bacterial division time--then before that happened, all I could tell was, I was surrounded by phospholipidness.

211
00:33:03,536 --> 00:33:07,072
So there was no real distinction in my environment.

212
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:23,080
But once the bacteria is divided into two, then I'm observing some "phospholipidness," which isn't in my sort of, what I call my own boundary.

213
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,756
So then I've kind of created space.

214
00:33:27,858 --> 00:33:46,252
Space and time is starting to appear, even though the petri dish hasn't changed in size, or the universe hasn't really changed, but it's the phospholipids, the orientation of the phospholipids.

215
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,140
So, yeah, I was just trying to liken it...if this is a scale invariant principle, how can we liken it to how other things might experience space and time emerging?

216
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,024
That's where I was coming from.

217
00:34:02,062 --> 00:34:08,292
Am I kind of totally barking up the wrong tree with that, or is that loosely [inaudible]?

218
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:19,340
No, I think that's a really good question, and I think you're constructing a very good kind of thought experiment.

219
00:34:20,480 --> 00:35:04,380
And it's this sort of question that I'm really going to try to address in October of how can we think about the FEP as a scale-free theory in practice, as applying at the level of macromolecules, as you were just describing; how do we come up with a description of what a phospholipid, say, can actually measure; what actually affects its state; and to what extent does it have a self-representation?

220
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,580
My guess is that a phospholipid probably doesn't.

221
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,384
But a bacterium seems to have at least some degree of self-representation.

222
00:35:15,432 --> 00:35:21,600
I mean, it has an immune system, it can feel stress.

223
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:30,150
So it's starting to seem like an organism that's not that different from us.

224
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,884
But even something like E. Coli, it certainly behaves in what we call space, but it's at least not clear to me that 'it' has a representation of space.

225
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,536
Although there are processes in the E. Coli that do distinguish, say, the two ends of the E. Coli.

226
00:36:05,412 --> 00:36:13,100
I mean, even if you think of the chemotaxis pathway, the two ends of that pathway are quite distinct functionally.

227
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,436
So perhaps E. Coli has a one dimensional representation of space.

228
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:31,250
It can tell its anterior end from its posterior end, but perhaps it doesn't have any representation of what we would call left and right or up and down.

229
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:51,992
But if you look at multicellular organisms, even something like, say, Hydra is a spatially quite sophisticated kind of thing.

230
00:36:52,046 --> 00:37:03,832
I mean, it's not bilateral, it's cylindrically symmetrical, but it's got a very large distinction between anterior and posterior.

231
00:37:03,976 --> 00:37:06,030
And it seems to know quite a bit.

232
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:15,410
At least I understand, from people who work on Hydra about its own body, the state of its own body.

233
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:29,092
So I think these are exactly the same kinds of questions that we should be asking, and they also apply at the scale that's much larger than us.

234
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:43,400
So if we think about a human society, for example, as an agent, what can that agent measure, and what can that agent represent?

235
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:50,830
And how complex can that agent's cognition be?

236
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:58,360
And I think those questions are all essentially open.

237
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,678
So, yeah, it's a great thought experiment.

238
00:38:02,854 --> 00:38:07,020
I think it addresses exactly the questions that we're interested in addressing here.

239
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:12,940
Thank you, Chris. Haris, and then anyone else with a raised hand.

240
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:21,120
Yes, thank you once again for allowing me to be here with all of you.

241
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,614
Interesting, as always.

242
00:38:23,812 --> 00:38:32,402
So, I have a question that is related to this notion of the dual aspect of information, basically that the meaning of information is not just a matter of interpretation, but rather it is rooted in the physical properties of the system under investigation.

243
00:38:48,650 --> 00:39:06,014
So, basically, that, as I understand it, means translates that the meaning of information is not separate from the physical properties of the system under investigation, but it is rather an intrinsic part of it.

244
00:39:06,212 --> 00:39:21,502
So I am also familiar with this notion from the theory of computation called the Bremermann's limit, that is, a limit on the maximum rate of computation that can be achieved, let's say, in a self-contained system within the material universe.

245
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:51,690
So my question is, how can we parse, let's say, that sort of computational limit in terms of information processing?

246
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,080
Thank you.

247
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:15,130
I am not sure that we can talk about a...

248
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:31,580
I think it's very difficult to talk about the classical information processing capability of the universe as a whole.

249
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:45,120
One has to impose some sort of classical description, and the question is, then, where does that description come from?

250
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:53,010
And from kind of whose point of view is that a description?

251
00:40:53,990 --> 00:41:14,330
But certainly, as soon as you partition the universe as a whole into some system and some other system, one can immediately talk about their information processing capabilities.

252
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:29,630
And then the question becomes quantum information processing capabilities versus classical information processing capabilities.

253
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:48,500
And if you're looking at classical information processing, to the extent that it's not reversible, it requires energy.

254
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:55,960
And so one can immediately derive limits based on the free energy access of that system.

255
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:24,550
If you're talking about reversible information processing, which purely quantum information processing is, then you don't have that energetic requirement, but you also don't have a well-defined answer in any classical terms.

256
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:40,190
If Alice is your system of interest that's able to do quantum information processing, then it's only her interaction partner, Bob, who can use her as a quantum computer.

257
00:42:41,120 --> 00:43:00,340
And then his ability to employ Alice as a quantum computer is limited by his classical information processing capabilities because he has to define a classical input and a classical output.

258
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:15,130
So I think this question becomes very complicated as soon as it is cast in these observer-relative terms.

259
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,586
But such limits clearly exist, right.

260
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,980
They just require certain assumptions to define them.

261
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:39,690
So quantum information can indeed be understood as a kind of dual to the classical information, right?

262
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,890
Yes.

263
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:57,660
And it's essentially one of these bulk-boundary type dualities that seem now to be ubiquitous in physics.

264
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,550
If we think in terms of the holographic principle, you can have quantum processing going on in the bulk in the system that has a boundary, and that can read classical information from the boundary and encode classical information on the boundary.

265
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:31,912
And quantitatively, the holographic principle tells you how much, right? What can the maximum entropy, classical entropy of the boundary be?

266
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:53,890
But what it doesn't tell you is anything about the semantics that either the system inside assigns to the information or any observer outside assigns to the information.

267
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,360
It's just a quantitative statement.

268
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:17,850
So in any setting that's characterized by that principle, the classical information on the boundary is dual in an interesting sense to the quantum processing that's going on inside in that classical information on the boundary encodes everything that an external observer can know about what's going on on the.

269
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,964
Yeah, okay.

270
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:44,490
Yeah, Ana and then Dean after.

271
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:49,558
Hi.

272
00:45:49,644 --> 00:45:50,920
Thank you very much.

273
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:58,040
I'm also new to your active inference and your course.

274
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:03,530
I just want to say that unfortunately, I work with humans.

275
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:12,910
And I say unfortunately because the complexities are horrific.

276
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:23,200
So, having said that, maybe my question will make sense.

277
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:41,080
So as I'm learning about quantum information theory and what I'm trying to do is assess, how can this help me answer questions that I have in the systems that I work with?

278
00:46:42,170 --> 00:47:02,010
My question is, in order to have a time arrow, irreversible process, don't you need to have a goal?

279
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:11,310
My question is, does it matter to even worry about goals?

280
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:29,160
Because as I listen to all the descriptions and I think about Alice and Bob and systems, I immediately think about, well, so much of what we're talking about depends upon the goal of the system.

281
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:43,690
And in some very abstract way, it seems to me that there is a goal that's driving the need for the boundary, the need for the communication.

282
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:58,080
And so I'm so obsessed with this question that I wanted to ask it early on before I proceed with my learning.

283
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,600
Yeah, that's a very good question.

284
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:27,640
You can think of the whole free energy principle as a way of describing physical systems in a way that makes their behavior as agents obvious.

285
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:43,370
And so you could state the FEP by saying that every system has a goal, and its goal is minimizing prediction error.

286
00:48:45,730 --> 00:49:03,490
Or to put it positively, its goal is to predict and therefore respond to its environment's actions in a way that preserves its own identity.

287
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:12,294
And I don't know whether you've read much of Karl Friston's work, but he uses the word self evidencing a lot.

288
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:22,046
He says the goal of any system is to generate evidence of its own existence, which sounds very psychological.

289
00:49:22,178 --> 00:49:29,930
And Karl, interestingly enough, studied first as a psychiatrist.

290
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:39,120
So I expect that his point of view is actually very consonant with your question and where you're coming from.

291
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:44,206
I started...

292
00:49:44,388 --> 00:49:44,974
I'm sorry.

293
00:49:45,012 --> 00:49:46,160
I didn't mean to interrupt...

294
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:47,502
No, no.

295
00:49:47,556 --> 00:49:48,160
Go.

296
00:49:50,388 --> 00:50:09,190
I've spent some time reading Karl Friston's ideas and work on the free energy principle and self-evidencing.

297
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:12,970
And, yes, I will continue to dig deep.

298
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:27,310
So I'm an anthropologist, and I've worked with indigenous peoples and spent 20 years of my life living in these small scale societies.

299
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,550
One of my observations is that--and that I find really fascinating...and we don't have a good understanding of it...and that's why I decided to dig into physics as information processing--which is that goals are constantly being negotiated.

300
00:50:59,522 --> 00:51:20,350
So, Michael Levin's work actually led me to explore quantum information theory, which is about the collective intelligences that exist within systems.

301
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:43,014
And so, at each level of collective intelligence, it's not just that you have a collective intelligence dictating a goal, but that those goals are being negotiated as the environments change and as relationships between the systems change.

302
00:51:43,212 --> 00:52:00,460
So I know these are very big questions, but if you could just help me, give me some thoughts on what your thoughts have been about these kinds of questions.

303
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:34,210
Yeah, I think you're pointing to something very important here, and this is a question that this kind of free energy principle-based work motivates immediately when you consider a system that comprises a bunch of subsystems.

304
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:49,930
I work with Michael Levin at Tufts in developmental biology, and one of his slogans is "all intelligence is collective."

305
00:52:51,150 --> 00:53:04,190
And that immediately brings up this issue of how do these components, as you put it, negotiate their goals?

306
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:07,162
How do they collaborate?

307
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:08,414
How do they compete?

308
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:14,740
To what extent are they trying to deceive each other or coerce each other or all of this?

309
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:26,226
And we're trying to apply this in a cell biology context as a description of development and morphogenesis.

310
00:53:26,338 --> 00:53:39,930
If you think about cells in a developing organism, they're constantly facing new environments, their capabilities are constantly changing, and how they interact with each other is constantly changing.

311
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:44,170
And this all seems very psychological or sociological.

312
00:53:45,730 --> 00:54:03,758
So I think what you're pointing to is the ubiquitous need for this kind of language in areas other than the human sciences.

313
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:15,458
I mean, it's language that's developed within the human sciences, but it's language that seems to be important at much smaller scales.

314
00:54:15,634 --> 00:54:25,100
And clearly, one would anticipate it being important in much larger scales, the scales of countries or civilizations or whatever.

315
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:31,642
So I guess my answer is yes.

316
00:54:31,696 --> 00:54:41,760
This is an extremely important point of view with very broad implications for how we think about biology, at least.

317
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:44,958
Thank you.

318
00:54:45,124 --> 00:54:46,000
Thank you.

319
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:52,290
Definitely looking forward to your continued learnings and journey.

320
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:55,250
Dean.

321
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:03,430
Yeah, my question has changed three times because just the other questions that have come up in the meantime.

322
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,360
So some context here.

323
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,782
Chris, you've kind of answered this.

324
00:55:11,836 --> 00:55:13,686
You mentioned dual, as in dual.

325
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:20,714
And then Ana brought up like, is there some kind of competition, a duel, a D-U-E-L going on?

326
00:55:20,752 --> 00:55:22,442
And how do we put those two things together?

327
00:55:22,496 --> 00:55:25,882
And me always thumping the table about minimum two.

328
00:55:25,936 --> 00:55:32,206
We have to keep at least two truisms up at once if we're going to gain some sense around things.

329
00:55:32,308 --> 00:55:41,326
I want to go back to that LOCC slide, if we can, for a second, because, Chris, you mentioned, your statement was, "you draw a boundary.'

330
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:45,380
And to me, there's a lot of information packed in those four words.

331
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:51,106
You can draw and you can undraw, you can bound, you can unbound.

332
00:55:51,298 --> 00:55:57,030
Those are perfectly contextless subject matter, information-carrying frames.

333
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:13,850
But you also have in that packet, you and at [?] which are imperfect orientations, an indefinite article, and all of us occupying a slide here, none of us claiming to be anything other than a contradiction.

334
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:32,286
So one aspect of that packet, two words of it, literally half of it, is perfectly contextless and is information carrying, and the other, literally half of that is prediction matter or information graphing.

335
00:56:32,398 --> 00:56:40,458
It's literally the byproduct or the spacetime construct that is included.

336
00:56:40,654 --> 00:56:50,402
So I guess what I'm wondering is, how do we make these different matters, the subject matter and the prediction matter tango, how do we get them to relate?

337
00:56:50,466 --> 00:56:55,814
Because in the session 5, you went on a detour.

338
00:56:55,862 --> 00:57:02,614
You said, we'll take a detour, which is it holds the exact same structure as you draw a boundary.

339
00:57:02,742 --> 00:57:09,082
So there's perfect information and there's imperfect information in that they're dancing.

340
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:11,006
We do this all the time.

341
00:57:11,188 --> 00:57:15,326
This seems to me, at a minimum, what information theory is.

342
00:57:15,508 --> 00:57:28,158
And that's why I want to kind of go back to this slide, because this slide was in a much earlier session, but it got to session 5, where the context could be recapitulated and so I'm wondering whether or not we can really talk about quantum information without the classical, or if that's even possible.

343
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:46,614
Well, I'll go back to [Niels] Borh's statement in his 1928 paper. He basically said, the answer to that question is no.

344
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:58,154
That we are humans, we have to communicate with each other, we have to do it in language, and that's classical communication.

345
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:26,790
While we are doing that, while we're having this conversation, we can't be worried about the question of, "do I still exist or do you still exist?"

346
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:41,850
We can worry about that question, but we can't do it at the same time that we're having this conversation about the theory of LOCC protocols or exchanging data from a Bell/EPR experiment.

347
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:47,470
And that's, of course, deeply paradoxical.

348
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:54,000
And I think that's just the situation we're in.

349
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:58,690
He said, none of us are claiming to be anything other than a contradiction.

350
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:09,540
It's a good thing that we are self-conscious about the fact that we're doing something contradictory here, or potentially contradictory here.

351
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:19,190
A colleague and I wrote a paper several years ago called "Science Generates Limit Paradoxes" [2015, Dietrich E, Fields C], and we basically rehearsed a version of this very discussion that we're having right now.

352
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:49,490
And the upshot of that paper is that in any situation in which a science can turn its theoretical apparatus onto its own practice--so, for example, when physics can turn this analysis of boundaries onto the practice of physics--then it generates paradoxes.

353
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:30,270
And those paradoxes have a particular structure, which is the structure that Priest [Graham Priest], I can't remember his first name, a logician who works in Dialetheic Logic, calls a limit paradox.

354
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:35,946
And all of this is coupled to Godel's theorem.

355
01:00:36,058 --> 01:00:43,330
And these other paradoxes of self-reference are aspects of self-reference.

356
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:50,550
But I think this situation really is ubiquitous and inescapable.

357
01:00:51,210 --> 01:01:35,700
That as soon as we apply the tools of science to the practice of science, we generate these paradoxical situations in which we have to acknowledge that we are entities of a certain sort, and that we are constructing our theories using a faculty of imagination that lets us act as if we don't have a point of view.

358
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:43,910
So it lets us act as if what we're talking about is point of view-independent.

359
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:52,220
But our theories themselves tell us that we have points of view and that they're important.

360
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:56,300
So we're stuck in this paradoxical situation.

361
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:08,160
I don't know whether that's what you're trying to point to here, but it's what I immediately leaped to, hearing what you said.

362
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,160
Yeah, a lot there.

363
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:23,610
Anyone else want to add a piece?

364
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,528
Yeah, I'm going to have to go.

365
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:33,188
So thank you, Chris.

366
01:02:33,284 --> 01:02:34,828
We'll stay for a few minutes.

367
01:02:34,914 --> 01:02:35,484
Thank you, though.

368
01:02:35,522 --> 01:02:36,268
This was awesome.

369
01:02:36,354 --> 01:02:38,430
We're really looking forward to lecture 6.

370
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,836
Okay, thank you all, and thank you all for attending this discussion session.

371
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:53,420
It's nice to have this kind of real time discussion which is missing during the actual lecture sessions, so I appreciate it.

372
01:02:55,046 --> 01:02:56,108
Thanks again.

373
01:02:56,294 --> 01:02:56,884
See you.

374
01:02:56,922 --> 01:02:57,620
Thank you.

375
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:58,980
Thank you, Chris.

376
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,824
Thank you, Kate.

377
01:03:03,872 --> 01:03:05,476
Do you want to ask anything, or anyone can just bring up anything they're thinking right now.

378
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,088
Nothing in particular.

379
01:03:12,174 --> 01:03:18,090
I'm just really looking forward to the last lecture on the biology of it all.

380
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,510
Great.

381
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:35,250
Well, any other thoughts or questions, or if anyone in the live chat has a thought or a question, they can write it and we'll read it in the coming minutes.

382
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:41,810
Well, I just wanted to thank you for creating the space.

383
01:03:43,060 --> 01:04:01,850
It's been absolutely amazing that I was able to find this situation where people are talking about enormous questions and very difficult questions.

384
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:13,960
I just thought I'd share that I find in academia.

385
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,780
I don't know why we're not having these conversations.

386
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:29,970
It's been like a ten year journey, and I have finally found this group.

387
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,160
I just wanted to express my gratitude.

388
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,950
Thank you.

389
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:42,660
I'll read a question from the live chat and anyone can give their thoughts.

390
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:52,500
So, Mills 8102 wrote, it seems that consilience would aim to ameliorate the problems of self reference.

391
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:56,760
Is this a category of solution that seems valuable or fraught?

392
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:04,870
Could consilience ameliorate the problems of self-reference?

393
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:13,426
Yes, Dean, can I just ask a different question built on that?

394
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:22,470
Which is, what if the contradiction is a feature as opposed to a fraughtness?

395
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,600
Do I contradict myself?

396
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:30,384
Very well, then.

397
01:05:30,422 --> 01:05:31,564
I contain multitudes.

398
01:05:31,612 --> 01:05:36,100
There's the Whitman angle, then there's the William Blake, "life is a fiction and is made up of contradiction."

399
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,820
So what is the problem of self-reference?

400
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:51,398
Whose problem is it?

401
01:05:51,484 --> 01:05:52,310
Haris?

402
01:05:53,130 --> 01:06:05,850
Yeah, I will try to answer a bit, to tackle a bit both questions by offering my views from the cognitive science perspective.

403
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:19,614
Basically, I think it has to do with consilience, has to do with the numerous cognitive bias that we all are, let's say, subjected to.

404
01:06:19,732 --> 01:06:27,954
So there is a very long list of cognitive biases, and there are more than 100 listed, I think.

405
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:42,178
So this is one of the challenges in terms of achieving, let's say, good levels of consilience across various domains.

406
01:06:42,354 --> 01:06:45,400
So this is what I wanted to add.

407
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,756
Another thought on that is consilience, though it can mean many things, synthesis.

408
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:12,108
I don't really have insights into the self-referencing problem.

409
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,910
I need to do a lot of thinking about that.

410
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:49,316
But coming from training in evolutionary biology and spending time in graduate school, postgraduate school, working on explanations where we thought of many hypotheses, models, etcetera, based on a goal, which is organisms are designed to maximize their fitness.

411
01:07:49,508 --> 01:07:53,850
And, of course, we know that there are lots of problems with that.

412
01:07:54,620 --> 01:08:03,244
And it turns out, with our data, what we found is that was not the case in the populations that we're working with.

413
01:08:03,362 --> 01:08:07,180
Too often, the goal did not seem to be fitness.

414
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:28,470
But what that experience gave me is that there was something we could hang on to in order to allow ourselves to propose models for why humans behave the way they do and the decisions that they make.

415
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:43,850
So that's why I go back to goals, because if, at whatever level of collective intelligence we're talking about, there is a goal, and Haris, please let me know if this would be correct, that even cognitive biases exist because there is some goal.

416
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:18,832
Yes, there is some sort of teleonomy in conscious agents, or personal systems, as I call them, and it has to do with goals and cognitive biases and the limitations on the knowledge.

417
01:09:26,452 --> 01:09:34,344
Let's say, maybe it's limitations on parts of the knowledge representation that each of us has.

418
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:47,052
Maybe there are limitations in terms of access to knowing, and there are various forms of knowing, so it depends on many things.

419
01:09:47,106 --> 01:10:08,230
And, for example, one of the cognitive biases that I believe can have a negative impact on consilience, let's say, in addressing this self-referentiality will be the halo effect.

420
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:37,710
So where you seem to prioritize, let's say, or give some advantage to some types of individuals, ideas, or even theories because of that, hell, for whatever reason that is, it is based on maybe on many different things, maybe on your past history or other things.

421
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,124
Thank you, Ana.

422
01:10:44,172 --> 01:10:47,580
And if I may add something rather briefly.

423
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:53,144
Your question reminded me of Levin's, and I think it was written with Fields--the proposal about reduction of stress as a goal that guides the emergence of collective structures--one of the papers formulated--that seems to be the goal that drives things as they grow in complexity, reduction of collective stress or reduction of stress at any level.

424
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:20,300
Yeah, I don't remember the title of the paper [see page 12, Box 1-Stress as the glue of agency, Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere: An Experimentally-Grounded Framework for Understanding Diverse Bodies and Minds, Levin M], but that was the gist of it, if I understood it correctly.

425
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:22,828
Thank you.

426
01:11:22,914 --> 01:11:24,092
I'll look that up.

427
01:11:24,226 --> 01:11:24,910
Great.

428
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:36,380
Another piece of the Levins-Fields collaboration that Chris alluded to earlier is that the notion of computation is observer-dependent; that's polycomputation.

429
01:11:38,028 --> 01:11:46,868
If there was a fully encrypted computation, an observer without the key would only be seeing noise to them.

430
01:11:47,034 --> 01:11:54,224
Whereas if they were to have the decryption key, then they could fully understand and go into more detail about the computation.

431
01:11:54,352 --> 01:12:09,470
So then let's say that we're in relation or observing or investigating some life phenomena at some scale, but we're speaking in the scale-free setting, but we're observing a thing that's there.

432
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:24,076
People have ascribed different goals to describe what we call goal-oriented behavior, like seemingly to survive or seemingly to have evolutionary fitness.

433
01:12:24,268 --> 01:12:31,260
However, one, An observer could also project different proximate goals; like the goal to minimize stress, the goal to minimize free energy, the goal to minimize surprise.

434
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:49,000
Those proximate-observer-proposed goals as if goals may be exactly isomorphic or aligned with fitness maximization.

435
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:54,836
So that could just be multiple perspectives of projective goals, and whatever the observer projects, that doesn't mean it describes the actual process of the phenomena at all.

436
01:13:09,346 --> 01:13:10,444
There's just nothing.

437
01:13:10,562 --> 01:13:13,804
Alice can make any story about Bob.

438
01:13:13,932 --> 01:13:23,904
And it may or may not have anything to do or even be possible to be of the kind that Bob tells about themselves.

439
01:13:24,022 --> 01:13:25,316
I want to just piggyback on that, Daniel, this is really hugely important.

440
01:13:27,898 --> 01:13:35,880
The moment you use the word goals, or the moment you use the word fitness, you are assuming context.

441
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:46,810
Whereas a lot of this stuff that's happening on this holographic screen is completely abstracted and completely context less.

442
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,140
There's no context required.

443
01:13:50,960 --> 01:14:07,056
So if you're going to focus on that part of it, as long as you can juggle both at the same time and keep the two things apart, because one does not require context, the other completely assumes that context is given.

444
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:10,412
And now you're taking that into your calculus.

445
01:14:10,476 --> 01:14:10,848
Right?

446
01:14:10,934 --> 01:14:12,290
But they're not the same.

447
01:14:13,786 --> 01:14:16,470
I want to reinforce what Daniel just said.

448
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,140
Thank you, Dean, Ian.

449
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,710
Unmute, then continue.

450
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:27,304
Thank you.

451
01:14:27,342 --> 01:14:33,064
Yeah, I was just maybe reinforcing what you were saying or reflecting on it.

452
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:42,700
I was thinking about the behaviors we see in other animals and even ourselves that we might not think are related to fitness.

453
01:14:43,120 --> 01:15:07,860
Like, I don't know, there's those kind of gazelle-type creatures that just jump into the air, but they seem to do that at a time which might make them be predated upon by some tiger or lion, which then all the sort of biologists try and figure out how is this related to fitness?

454
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,668
And we may do the same.

455
01:15:09,754 --> 01:15:14,336
If I go and mow my lawn, waste half a Sunday afternoon, mowing my lawn, what's that got to do with my fitness?

456
01:15:16,052 --> 01:15:21,588
Well, actually, it's to do with keeping up with the Joneses and my social status.

457
01:15:21,764 --> 01:15:27,064
So it's really hard to actually know what my behavior is about.

458
01:15:27,262 --> 01:15:36,684
I can create a story to say that it's to do with minimizing free energy or fitness, but really, is it or not?

459
01:15:36,722 --> 01:15:37,388
I don't know.

460
01:15:37,474 --> 01:15:41,890
Is that kind of what you were getting at or something different?

461
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:44,624
Yeah, it's a great point.

462
01:15:44,662 --> 01:15:48,720
And also, it's come up several times about goals.

463
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:53,756
The term goal is not to be found within the active inference ontology, strictly speaking, that's why we have so much fun with what we expect and what we prefer.

464
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:04,192
How can it be what we expect and be the positive thing that we pursue?

465
01:16:04,336 --> 01:16:06,900
Well, that's how paths of least action work.

466
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:17,508
And then if somebody else wants to look at that path of least action and say, well, here was a mile point, and this is where it looked like they were heading north, and this is where it looked like the goal was to evade this, those are all stories that an observer could tell about a path, or that the path might tell itself about its own path.

467
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:37,388
But those goal narratives don't need to be implemented proximally or primally with goals, as a kind of core player in the active inference ontology. I'll read some of these great comments and questions, just if anybody has a thought on them from the live chat, just feel free.

468
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:55,832
John Reed wrote, what does the active inference group--I think that's us, but includes everyone--think about the equation of pilot wave with Many Worlds recently expounded upon by Chris O'Dowd at PBS.

469
01:17:06,548 --> 01:17:14,220
I found it to be mixing terms and frustrating personally; any thoughts on pilot wave and Many Worlds?

470
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:33,700
And I would also just be curious on the physics or technical side, where does what Chris is sharing connect to these kinds of discussions that people have about Many Worlds and different interpretations of quantum?

471
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:39,472
Yeah, that's a great question.

472
01:17:39,526 --> 01:17:41,890
So I don't know that I can answer it.

473
01:17:43,060 --> 01:18:07,770
I know that when it comes to interpretations of quantum mechanics, whether the collapse or the Many Worlds or whatever, I think what they're hinting at, and Chris would probably answer something along those lines, that quantum theory is fundamentally about information.

474
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:23,820
And until we make sense of that fully and fully spell out all the details, I think these philosophical issues or the interpretations of quantum mechanics are going to linger.

475
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:35,884
I don't have any strong thoughts on interpretations, and I would say I'm an agnostic about interpretations of quantum mechanics.

476
01:18:36,012 --> 01:18:43,120
I don't know that I subscribe to any of, and especially pilot wave, I don't have the slightest idea about it.

477
01:18:48,058 --> 01:18:48,980
Haris?

478
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:49,784
Yes.

479
01:18:49,822 --> 01:18:54,724
If you allow me, I have a small story regarding pilot wave.

480
01:18:54,852 --> 01:19:13,244
I was conversing with ChatGPT and I actually asked what it thought about pilot wave after watching a lecture on it and then I got intrigued and I wanted to ask and this actually happened.

481
01:19:13,442 --> 01:19:18,828
The model started replying and I got the chance to read a bit the reply.

482
01:19:18,924 --> 01:19:26,300
And the reply was like, it is very interesting, but most probably is not correct, it is wrong.

483
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:31,872
And then it must have reached some sort of information goal.

484
01:19:32,016 --> 01:19:36,516
It retracted the reply and it replied to me.

485
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:38,230
Can you ask me a different question?

486
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:44,980
So this is my short experience with pilot wave theory.

487
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,176
Can I ask a question?

488
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:50,520
Is a pilot wave more or less than 100ft in height?

489
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,350
I think it's exactly 100.

490
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,550
Any other thoughts or questions?

491
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:10,270
It's a fun and lively live chat too, which is always fun.

492
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:31,140
Yeah, well, we are it coming right along in the year and now 5, 6 completed with this course.

493
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:38,430
So any comments that anyone here just wants to make in a closing round?

494
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:41,220
Anybody who wants to can go for it.

495
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:44,920
Yeah, I have a question.

496
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:50,870
If questions come up, have come up during the session, who could I send them to and how?

497
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:00,140
Great question.

498
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:08,470
In the video description, you can get to the syllabus of the course and one of the pages on the course website.

499
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,422
Course syllabus is a question and answer form.

500
01:21:11,556 --> 01:21:19,818
So you'll see several dozen questions that people have already written and Chris gives answers and then it's publicly posted.

501
01:21:19,994 --> 01:21:26,500
All of the lectures, discussions and questions and answers will be published after the course.

502
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:34,674
So every question, no matter from where, or where to, all of these questions are encouraged, it only makes it a richer and more relevant publication.

503
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,000
Thank you.

504
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:48,170
Okay, Ian, Harris or Dean?

505
01:21:52,836 --> 01:21:54,906
Susan also says post in discord.

506
01:21:55,018 --> 01:21:55,920
Great point.

507
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:03,070
Yeah, I just wanted to add a small point as a conclusion.

508
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:20,642
From my personal perspective, I really find that the ideas of Chris Fields, they can be revolutionary, let's say in a variety of different fields.

509
01:22:20,786 --> 01:22:34,310
And I can see it in quantum cryptography and also about what I've mentioned before in terms of quantum knowledge representation.

510
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:38,822
So these are the two fields that I can clearly see it.

511
01:22:38,896 --> 01:22:44,650
So it is great to be able to participate in this conversation.

512
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:46,800
So once again, thanks to everyone.

513
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:55,890
Great to participate in this conversation or quantum knowledge representation, whichever you prefer.

514
01:22:58,070 --> 01:23:00,450
Ander, any last comments?

515
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:04,690
Not really.

516
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,322
Just looking forward to the next one. I guess.

517
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:10,242
I should say.

518
01:23:10,376 --> 01:23:12,530
And what next year?

519
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,500
This is going to be an ongoing thing.

520
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:16,438
Yes, we'll.

521
01:23:16,454 --> 01:23:18,780
We'll come back stronger next year, for sure.

522
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:22,474
Okay.

523
01:23:22,672 --> 01:23:23,862
What a ride.

524
01:23:24,006 --> 01:23:24,954
Thank you all.

525
01:23:25,072 --> 01:23:26,954
See you next time.

526
01:23:27,152 --> 01:23:27,930
Bye.

527
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:30,860
Bye, everyone.

528
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:31,830
Bye.
