3150	3700	1	A	0.54	You.
6710	8418	2	B	0.69	Hello and welcome, everyone.
8584	20930	3	B	0.99871	It's September 30, 2023, and we are in physics as information processing discussion five should be a fun discussion on a great fifth lecture.
21430	40438	4	B	0.99977	So, Andre, if you'd like to give some opening remarks, and then also anyone else, whether it's your first time joining a discussion or not, it would be great to hear your remarks on lecture five or just where you're coming at it today.
40544	42270	5	B	0.97226	So first though, Andre.
43810	44222	6	C	0.99971	Sure.
44276	45418	7	C	1.0	Hello, Daniel.
45594	51230	8	C	0.76961	So I may as well start off by sharing the slides, right?
51300	52320	9	C	1.0	What do you think?
53430	54180	10	B	0.83361	Sure.
54870	62580	11	C	0.98267	So just before, as a warm up, let's review some of the things that Chris mentioned last time.
63750	72230	12	C	0.86215	So near the beginning, the main thing was this distinction between reductionist and scale free theories.
74810	84758	13	C	0.99975	Obviously, one very salient feature of the free energy literature is that it falls under scale free theories.
84934	92510	14	C	0.99945	These are theories where there is no preferred scale of energy or distance.
94930	99706	15	C	0.56846	Reductionist theories are based on such a scale existing.
99738	100030	16	C	0.9706	Right.
100100	104766	17	C	1.0	You want to break the pieces into the fundamental building blocks of the Legos.
104958	126550	18	C	1.0	People think of usually high energy or particle physics as the archetype of this thing, whereas in scale three theories, there is no such thing, and we should have the same skeletons or the same framework at different scales.
128990	131660	19	C	0.95	This is going to be very important.
132110	150874	20	C	0.99814	Chris, correct me if I'm wrong, but especially for the coming lecture where we talk about biology, Chris himself made a few remarks on how the renormalization group flow, aka the process of going from smaller to higher scale, may be trivial in biology.
151002	154766	21	C	1.0	That is to say that there is a self similarity.
154878	161102	22	C	0.72	Okay, so some features of biology should remain invariant at different scales.
161246	171080	23	C	0.65	That is what cells are to a body, different individuals of a species might be to an ecosystem, that sort of idea.
172650	187498	24	C	0.99635	So after talking at scale, and perhaps when we get to the question parts, I guess this is the one thing that I would like Chris to explain a little more precisely what these diagrams mean.
187584	191774	25	C	1.0	I have a rough idea, but it would be nice to hear him talk about that again.
191972	196000	26	C	0.98716	Anyways, in the second half, basically.
198050	198798	27	A	0.99996	We.
198964	207860	28	C	0.99997	Started asking, as is the theme in this course, so far from first principles, what do you need to talk about?
209350	210562	29	C	0.99988	Space and time.
210696	217258	30	C	1.0	And there were some theorizing that time might be more fundamental.
217374	221698	31	C	0.53	That is, the things that you need to implement a clock.
221874	226050	32	C	0.99994	We're thinking about what are the most basic constituents to implement a clock?
226210	233386	33	C	1.0	And those may be even more basic than the things you need to implement QRFs or perception of space.
233568	242062	34	C	0.99999	After all, it seems like you need some spatial extension to perceive a space in the first place.
242196	249040	35	C	1.0	I can't remember if it was somebody who was tuning in for the lecture or a question afterwards or something like that.
249570	254226	36	C	0.99636	But I think this remark gets to a very deep point.
254408	260334	37	C	0.99989	Somebody I recall mentioned that some organisms, it might have been Chris himself.
260382	277830	38	C	1.0	I can't remember, really that there are organisms, you may know the name, Daniel, that are so tiny that if they try to implement a gradient, to try to chase their food or whatever, they're so small that they can't even perceive the gradient.
279230	288566	39	C	0.9997	Any attempt at implementing such perception, they're going to feel the same amount of concentration in all directions.
288598	291166	40	C	0.99607	So they're basically not large enough to perceive space.
291268	295342	41	C	0.99425	However, interestingly, so, they can perceive time.
295476	302186	42	C	0.99	I don't know how this ties to the remarks that Chris made about space being more fundamental.
302218	309410	43	C	0.95	I suppose Chris was getting at the point that you need fewer parts to perceive space.
309560	319350	44	C	0.93	And the fact that such small organisms can perceive time but not space, I guess, is further empirical evidence for this thesis.
322730	324342	45	A	0.99564	Actually, Andrew, if I can.
324476	325190	46	A	0.9	Yes, please.
325260	327190	47	C	0.91	I may not botch the explanation.
327690	328258	48	A	0.99	Yeah.
328364	337386	49	A	0.99	I proposed earlier that time is actually more fundamental than space, that one has to have time to be able to see space.
337568	340410	50	A	0.9888	So that's further on in these slides.
340770	342602	51	A	0.98	That issue is discussed.
342746	343440	52	C	0.98	Yeah.
344530	347150	53	C	0.99502	Do you want to say something about duckers?
350620	353000	54	A	0.99974	Well, this is the right slide.
356380	357130	55	A	0.63	Yeah.
358560	369440	56	A	0.5	One just needs a memory, really, to have a clock, an external clock, to have an internal clock.
370740	373356	57	A	0.95	One also has to have a memory to have an internal clock.
373388	392120	58	A	0.99997	But if you have a memory and there's some kind of activity that's periodic in the environment, then you have a clock, an external clock, but you don't need object identity to have a clock.
392780	398568	59	A	1.0	And that's what distinguishes it from space.
398654	403428	60	A	1.0	You have to have object identity, or in other words, motion.
403524	406830	61	A	1.0	The ability to perceive motion, to perceive space.
407680	408430	62	C	0.95067	Right.
412220	412584	63	C	0.55	Yeah.
412622	415320	64	C	0.75393	Any periodic behavior is effectively a clock.
416380	433932	65	C	0.8706	Whereas for space, we need object persistence, which two comments that we've made were that object persistence, or rather Chris made, is the defining feature of classicality.
434076	435056	66	C	1.0	You said that last time.
435078	436124	67	C	0.96754	Is that right, Chris?
436252	446210	68	C	0.92	And also that object persistence is precisely the notion of thinness, the way freestone would put.
447860	449168	69	A	0.71	Yeah, yeah.
449254	459124	70	A	0.99982	Object persistence is definitely a classical notion, and it does seem to be the place where classicality enters.
459172	468200	71	A	0.99808	Quantum theory, as far as I can tell, is with this notion of object persistence that that's the most fundamental place that it enters.
468960	485010	72	C	0.97087	So how does that definition of, or rather, relationship between classicality and quantumness being object persistence, how does it compare with other accounts coming from QdaR and decoherence and all of that?
488820	491810	73	A	0.97388	Well, say quantum Darwinism is a good example.
493000	496240	74	A	0.9954	Quantum Darwinism assumes object persistence.
496400	508440	75	A	0.81203	It assumes that there is some persistent thing that interacts over time with the environment according to some interaction that has fixed eigenvalues.
509500	554150	76	A	0.98449	So quantum Darwinism already assumes object persistence, and it also assumes classical communication, as we discussed a couple of times ago, in that it's a theory that is about the ability of multiple observers to agree about the state of some other object, which for them to agree about that object, not only does the object need to persist, the various observers need to have the same description of that object, or the same name for that object, or the same way of identifying that object.
555500	560440	77	A	0.96489	So, yeah, Quantum Darwinism actually assumes a lot of classical features.
564300	571420	78	A	1.0	The basic theory of environmental decoherence is, in effect, a single observer theory.
572000	584856	79	A	0.99998	So it doesn't have to assume classical communication, but it does assume object persistence, which obviously, if you're going to talk about empirical science, you have to.
584978	592060	80	A	1.0	You have to assume that your detector is a thing that persists through time, or you can't do an experiment.
592220	596710	81	A	1.0	And more importantly than that, you have to assume that you're a thing that persists through time.
600920	604820	82	A	0.94944	So we need these classical notions to talk about doing science.
608710	611014	83	A	0.9995	I'm not the first person to point that out, of course.
611052	618550	84	A	1.0	I mean, Bohr pointed that out in 1928 in his paper in Science, where he summarizes quantum theory.
619450	623100	85	A	0.99993	So it's a very old idea, right.
624190	641440	86	C	0.59	And I guess right away I have a question that I suspect I may have asked before, but maybe we can revisit it from the perspective of today's discussion, which is, and maybe I should pull the slide, this is actually from session four.
642450	664866	87	C	0.9993	So if we're talking about differences between what the defining feature of classicality is, to me, that bears the question of here, right, this TQFT diagrammatic notation for the classical and the quantum channels.
664978	683718	88	C	0.96451	So if we're talking about object persistence as the defining feature of classicality, and this is the cartoon picture of what goes on an EPR experiment, Chris, could you say maybe a few words about how the symmetry is broken between the quantum and classical channels?
683814	692318	89	C	0.88	I suspect it might have been mentioned that these are symmetrical, but yet one of the two has to be a quantum, and the other one is a classical channel.
692484	699410	90	C	0.98	The quantum channel mediates some sort of unitary evolution, is that correct?
699480	710426	91	C	0.99897	Whereas the classical channel is like an information redundancy reservoir, which maybe has to do something with object persistence.
710478	714726	92	C	0.99871	But I'm very much speculating at this point, so I'm not sure if.
714748	716150	93	C	0.99021	Chris, you have any comments?
717370	724230	94	A	1.0	Yeah, well, an easy way to think about this, I think, is to actually think about a Bell EPR experiment.
724310	730042	95	A	0.99999	Where you have two observers that are separated in know.
730176	738270	96	A	1.0	You have to assume here to talk about Bell EPR, you have to assume the Notion of Space to have a laboratory Reference Frame.
739490	743150	97	A	0.99999	In which the two observers are spatially separated.
745590	755300	98	A	0.83	And in that situation, then the two observers both independently collect data for some amount of time.
758010	765074	99	A	0.84559	On multiple replicates of some quantum state that's produced by a source.
765122	769880	100	A	0.9992	So you have Pairs of Photons or pairs of electrons or pairs of whatever.
771070	776490	101	A	1.0	And at some point, the data collection Stops.
777390	782330	102	A	0.99	And at that point, the observers have to compare their results.
783570	789760	103	A	0.86314	So it's the comparison step that requires a Classical channel.
791730	804910	104	A	1.0	And if you think about how this happens, in practice, it happens via a file sent over to the Internet.
805070	811346	105	A	0.99997	Or a piece of paper on which the data are written.
811378	815830	106	A	0.77614	That's handed by one of the experimenters to the other experimenter.
816410	821738	107	A	0.99996	Or it happens by the experimenters talking to each other.
821904	827980	108	A	0.64478	So one experimenter encodes a Bunch of Information in the ambient air.
828430	830860	109	A	0.58	And the other experimenter hears it.
833150	837182	110	A	0.99851	Or it can be Communicated by light signals, right?
837316	840270	111	A	0.99999	But it's always Communicated by some medium.
841330	847502	112	A	0.52	And that's what Defines Classical communication.
847566	857010	113	A	0.66931	It's Communication Via a Medium that persists through time in the observer's Reference Frame.
859130	868440	114	A	0.98	And the Minimum time of the persistence of that medium is given by the speed of light.
869130	872454	115	A	0.99998	So if the observers are a foot apart.
872502	878330	116	A	1.0	And they're Communicating by a light signal, then it may only last a nanosecond.
880350	886030	117	A	1.0	But if they're talking to each other, it lasts several seconds.
886610	895390	118	A	1.0	And if they exchange a piece of paper, then that piece of paper May last for years in a Lab Notebook someplace.
896070	903700	119	A	0.99926	So there's always the Question of Persistence over time.
905910	916600	120	A	1.0	That is deeply bound up with this Notion of Classicality as a process that takes time.
919690	923654	121	A	0.93	Information has to flow, has to be encoded in a Medium.
923702	929260	122	A	0.95	And then Read from that Medium in some Finite amount of time.
931310	939870	123	A	0.85	And in a sense, we're assuming something like that in the Quantum Description.
940530	951470	124	A	0.99997	When we think of this boundary via which the A and B, the physical components, interact.
953730	960040	125	A	0.99969	If we think of that boundary as a qubit array, then each of those qubits persist through time.
960650	965350	126	A	1.0	And that's what allows them to encode classical information.
965500	970760	127	A	0.99983	So encode observational outcomes that are repeated in time.
972430	982010	128	A	0.99989	That's what allows them to serve as a memory, to encode information in a way that's thermodynamically irreversible.
983570	991520	129	A	1.0	And if you think of the boundary in that way as a qubit array, then it has a certain thickness in time.
994530	997090	130	A	0.85442	It's two Planck times thick.
998230	1005780	131	A	1.0	The Planck time is ten to the -43 seconds, so it's unmeasurably small.
1006470	1023080	132	A	0.99999	But the operation of interacting with a qubit is a physical interaction that, from a relativistic point of view, has to take this minimal time.
1029900	1036430	133	A	0.99975	It's, in a sense, persistence for times that are significantly longer than the Planck time.
1037440	1041390	134	A	0.88	That is the marker of classicality here.
1044080	1059760	135	A	0.99988	But even these Planck time, even persistence over the Planck time is a necessary ingredient for talking about communication, even quantum communication.
1061620	1070644	136	A	0.99843	So it's a very, very deep concept with a very long philosophical history going back to the ship of Theseus and all that.
1070762	1072432	137	A	1.0	People have been wondering about.
1072586	1075610	138	A	0.77	What does it mean to say that something persists through time?
1078620	1085450	139	B	0.99589	Does anyone want to make a comment on that or bring in a new question?
1087440	1090590	140	B	0.98001	Please feel free to, if you haven't brought up anything yet.
1091840	1095790	141	C	0.86147	Sure, I can speak mean, if you don't mind.
1097280	1114980	142	C	1.0	I also recall, and Chris, correct me if I'm wrong, we said that, related to what you just said, that clock tick is always tantamount to one of these classical channels.
1115480	1116164	143	C	0.99986	Is that correct?
1116202	1118260	144	C	0.99713	Did I remember that correctly.
1130850	1131710	145	A	0.69208	Chris?
1135190	1135940	146	A	1.0	Yeah.
1136470	1141890	147	A	0.99968	An internal clock tick corresponds to an irreversible right on the boundary.
1144010	1148710	148	A	0.99949	So one can then ask, what does it mean to say that that's irreversible?
1151530	1154600	149	A	1.0	What it means is it took some energy to do it.
1155390	1169290	150	A	0.94	And if you go back to read that bit again, there's at least a reasonably high probability that it still is in the same state that you wrote it in.
1169440	1169958	151	C	0.50972	Right?
1170064	1177690	152	A	0.93	And clearly, that probability is going to degrade through time because that action is on the boundary.
1177850	1187582	153	A	0.91336	So whatever you've written, whatever bits that you've written are now exposed to the environment.
1187726	1192770	154	A	0.99464	So if Alice writes them, they're now exposed to Bob and to Bob's dynamics.
1193690	1210780	155	A	0.99669	So as time goes on by your internal clock or any external clock, the probability of that memory being the same when you go back to read it, slowly decreases, or maybe it decreases fast.
1211550	1232180	156	A	1.0	And we know that from our own case, our own memories degrade through time because the physical world is interacting with our brains in ways that we don't control, killing neurons or changing their activity or whatever.
1233670	1248040	157	A	0.99989	So whenever we talk about memory, it's always with this caveat that the memory is exposed to the environment and it's not guaranteed to be the same.
1248890	1263710	158	A	0.95925	It's only kind of grace of the environment being reasonably benign that any of us have memories at all.
1268160	1274800	159	C	0.98112	So this thermodynamic cost to classical information sharing or writing.
1276740	1292528	160	C	0.93537	Would it be fair to say that, in a sense, the price you have to pay to protect against decoherence, or entangling this sector with the rest of the environment just to preserve its identity?
1292704	1294230	161	C	0.99994	Would that be fair to say?
1295400	1300312	162	A	0.51	Yeah, I mean, you can think of decoherence as a good thing, or you can think of decoherence as a bad thing.
1300366	1300970	163	A	0.97674	Right.
1301500	1305800	164	A	0.99999	If you're trying to preserve a quantum state, then it's a bad thing.
1305870	1313980	165	A	1.0	You have to spend energy to prevent decoherence by cooling everything down to Milli Kelvins.
1316160	1331280	166	A	0.99984	But if you're interested in preserving classical data, then decoherence is a good thing, because it prevents your classical data from being completely rearranged by becoming entangled with the environment.
1333320	1353530	167	A	0.99993	Think about trying to write classical memories using the states of atoms in the middle of the sun, and the temperature is so high that you can't do anything, you can't rearrange the atoms in any way and expect them to stay put.
1354220	1361608	168	A	0.99964	So there you're in effectively a completely quantum environment just because of the high temperature.
1361704	1363580	169	A	0.99995	So it's a plasma.
1368030	1368490	170	C	1.0	Yeah.
1368560	1399190	171	C	0.56	And then just one final question that popped to my mind, as you say this, and I can certainly leave it here for everyone else, so if we're trying to protect about, against random loss, against the loss of information, I suppose it really begs the question of what is the source of this noise that can perturb the bits in the boundary?
1401210	1406738	172	C	0.82661	There's obviously this distinction between thermal and quantum noise.
1406914	1411242	173	C	0.99998	Again, it's a stretch to see if we can think back about the Wick rotation, about that.
1411376	1434930	174	C	0.97319	But again, I recall earlier sessions where we talk how the noise here in this quantum theoretic picture of information processing is coming from the QRFs failing to be aligned, then you hear about notions of quantum noise versus thermal noise.
1435350	1438340	175	C	0.77048	Chris, do you have any comments on all of that?
1440150	1451160	176	A	0.99	Yeah, I think an important thing here, let me back up.
1453210	1464330	177	A	1.0	The notion of noise, like so many other notions, is very often treated as objective, as observer independent.
1465470	1475230	178	A	0.98	And so when we're doing classical physics, we think of noise as know there's some objective randomness in the universe, and we call that noise.
1476050	1485234	179	A	0.94514	So in this picture, because we're working with just a bipartite decomposition, right, we just have Alice and Bob, and that's it.
1485272	1487010	180	A	0.85711	That's the entire universe.
1489830	1495570	181	A	0.99914	There's no external environment here to impose any sort of noise.
1496070	1519046	182	A	0.97088	But since we only have two systems, Alice and Bob equals everything else, not Alice, then if we talk about Bob being a noisy environment, that's clearly relative to this boundary we've drawn between Alice and Bob.
1519238	1521862	183	A	0.9413	So noise isn't observer independent.
1522006	1528400	184	A	0.99516	What's noise for Alice is just Bob's dynamics, right?
1532370	1557350	185	A	0.99987	If you think about where these systems come from, you've got some universe that is in some pure state, because it's an isolated system, and that state is evolving through time, which means it's just undergoing phase rotation.
1558570	1561740	186	A	0.99993	So there's no noise in that system.
1562270	1562682	187	A	0.95234	Right.
1562736	1565690	188	A	0.99949	It's perfectly unitary, et cetera, et cetera.
1566030	1577440	189	A	0.99995	As soon as you draw a boundary, then there's information that the system on one side of the boundary doesn't have about the system on the Other side.
1578370	1595104	190	A	0.99953	So the individual systems are their states can now be considered conditionally independent.
1595152	1600500	191	A	1.0	I mean, you can come up with a description in which their states are conditionally independent.
1601020	1610360	192	A	0.9	And that just means that what the other side is doing looks like noise.
1611260	1624572	193	A	0.89249	Unless Alice, say, can come up with a way of analyzing the data that she sees on her boundary in a way that makes it make sense, right?
1624626	1628924	194	A	0.99	And then we say it's information for Alice.
1628972	1630240	195	A	0.99953	But what does that mean?
1630390	1638290	196	A	0.99941	It just means it's behavior on her boundary that she's smart enough to assign some kind of semantics to.
1641080	1645620	197	A	1.0	And if she's not smart enough to do that, then it's just noise.
1650140	1659210	198	A	0.95226	So as soon as you make the notion of noise observer dependent, it turns into something that makes a lot more sense.
1664060	1664724	199	A	0.95	And.
1664862	1685596	200	C	0.52	And just to really finish this, I guess it's been a couple of months at least, but I think it was back in July that we talked about the distinction between what you're saying, which is things having the appearance of noise, just because you have finite resources.
1685628	1696832	201	C	0.77189	So you cannot make sense of Bob's internal dynamics, as opposed to in that cartoon of the four possibilities for QRFs, alignments.
1696896	1697172	202	C	0.80717	Right.
1697226	1705592	203	C	0.99999	Some of them were thermal in the sense that one side was acting on a boundary qubits while the other one was not.
1705646	1710250	204	C	0.93042	So then it truly looks like noise to the other side.
1711660	1718044	205	C	0.77406	Does that get to the bottom of the distinction between quantum and thermal noise at all, Chris, or am I misunderstanding things here?
1718082	1725492	206	A	0.96	Yeah, it turns the distinction into essentially a QRF.
1725576	1733612	207	A	0.87712	Relative languages.
1733676	1735024	208	A	0.99973	Provide a good example.
1735222	1739170	209	A	0.99976	Think of going to someplace where you don't understand the language at all.
1739720	1742070	210	A	0.6535	Papua New guinea or something like that.
1742840	1745060	211	A	1.0	I certainly wouldn't understand the language.
1747640	1759610	212	A	0.89	That language, the behavior of speaking that language encodes lots of information for those people and encodes no information at all for me.
1759980	1762312	213	A	0.99994	So it looks like noise to me.
1762366	1767230	214	A	1.0	I can't make sense of it, but it's not noise from their point of view.
1769520	1775900	215	A	0.73	And now let's think about this need to have a thermodynamic sector.
1775980	1795300	216	A	0.99999	If yOu're an organism that has to burn energy, or any system that has to burn energy to act irreversibly on your environment, that thermodynamic sector looks to you like noise.
1796120	1798820	217	A	0.77808	It's just temperature, heat.
1800700	1806388	218	A	1.0	And you use that heat to drive your processing.
1806484	1816760	219	A	1.0	And if you're a really good heat engine, then you can use it pretty efficiently and get a lot of bang for the buck in terms of information processing.
1816920	1829010	220	A	0.89639	If you're a really inefficient heat engine, then maybe you have to use almost your entire environment as heat to do any little bit of information processing at all.
1829940	1835232	221	A	0.59545	So that's not a statement about the universe as a whole.
1835286	1846420	222	A	0.97915	That's a statement about you and your information processing capabilities and your heat processing capabilities.
1847320	1849540	223	A	0.99941	How good is your carnot cycle?
1851260	1855530	224	A	0.69613	Determines the amount of information processing you can do.
1857500	1858724	225	B	0.99929	Thank you, Chris.
1858852	1859640	226	B	0.50849	Ian.
1866900	1867650	227	D	0.94127	Hi.
1868180	1870972	228	D	0.76	Yeah, thank you, everyone, for putting on this series.
1871036	1873920	229	D	0.98469	It's the first time I've joined the discussion.
1877140	1894040	230	D	0.94465	So it's a question about, in one of the slides, there was a green rectangle, and we were talking about that being, or Chris was talking about that being, a kind of thinking of that as a bacterium.
1895020	1898010	231	D	1.0	And it got me wondering whether.
1899740	1900056	232	C	0.99865	How.
1900078	1904200	233	D	0.99999	Else I could get an intuitive grasp of this kind of spacetime emerging.
1908240	1918400	234	D	0.69	What I was thinking is, it appears like to us humans, it appears like the universe is expanding through time.
1918470	1944532	235	D	1.0	And I was just trying to think a bacterium, if you placed a single bacterium on a petri dish at time zero, or even something more simple, let's say deep sea hydrothermal vent, where life was supposed to, these agents were supposed to have maybe begun existing as phospholipid type molecules.
1944596	1969276	236	D	0.99989	So I was just wondering if I was a phospholipid within that bacterial membrane, just one single phospholipid, and all I can measure is the existence of phospholipidness, or not phospholipidness, and selfness and not selfness.
1969388	1977712	237	D	0.99991	Then I was just trying to imagine, as this bacteria divides after 20 minutes, let's say, the average sort of bacterial division time.
1977846	1983472	238	D	0.94003	Then before that happeNed, all I could tell was I was surrounded by phospholipidness.
1983536	1987072	239	D	0.99998	So there was no real distinction in my environment.
1987136	2003080	240	D	0.99998	But once the bacteria is divided into two, then I'm observing some phospholipidness, which isn't in my sort of what I call my own boundary.
2004400	2007756	241	D	0.65471	So then I've kind of created space.
2007858	2026252	242	D	0.41356	Space and time is starting to appear, even though the petri dish hasn't changed in size, or the universe hasn't really changed, but it's the phospholipids, the orientation of the phospholipids.
2026316	2029140	243	D	0.99949	So, yeah, I was just trying to liken it.
2029210	2040960	244	D	0.99995	If this is a scale invariant principle, how can we liken it to how other things might experience space and time emerging?
2041040	2042024	245	D	0.99999	That's where I was coming from.
2042062	2048292	246	D	1.0	Am I kind of totally barking up the wrong tree with that, or is that loose?
2048356	2059340	247	A	0.99815	No, I think that's a really good question, and I think you're constructing a very good kind of thought experiment.
2060480	2104380	248	A	0.98	And it's this sort of question that I'm really going to try to address in October of how can we think about DFEP as a scale ferry theory in practice, as applying at the level of macromolecules, as you were just describing, how do we come up with a description of what a phospholipid, say, can actually measure what actually affects its state, and to what extent does it have a self representation?
2106480	2109580	249	A	0.99963	My guess is that a phospholipid probably doesn't.
2110400	2115384	250	A	0.99997	But a bacterium seems to have at least some degree of self representation.
2115432	2121600	251	A	0.99	I mean, it has an immune system, it can feel stress.
2122820	2130150	252	A	0.9999	So it's starting to seem like an organism that's not that different from us.
2133480	2136884	253	A	0.99876	But even something like E.
2136922	2145030	254	A	0.98061	Coli, it certainly behaves in what we call space.
2145960	2150630	255	A	0.99968	But it's at least not clear to me that it has a representation of space.
2154540	2158536	256	A	0.98883	Although there are processes in the E.
2158558	2164936	257	A	0.93457	Coli that do distinguish, say, the two ends of the E.
2164958	2165364	258	A	0.99946	Coli.
2165412	2173100	259	A	0.99	I mean, even if you think of the chemotaxis pathway, the two ends of that pathway are quite distinct functionally.
2174000	2175436	260	A	0.99777	So perhaps E.
2175458	2179100	261	A	0.87278	Coli has a one dimensional representation of space.
2179170	2191250	262	A	0.9998	It can tell its anterior end from its posterior end, but perhaps it doesn't have any representation of what we would call left and right or up and down.
2195300	2211992	263	A	0.97597	But if you look at multicellular organisms, even something like, say, Hydra is a spatially quite sophisticated kind of thing.
2212046	2223832	264	A	0.65	I mean, it's not bilateral, it's cylindrically symmetrical, but it's got a very large distinction between anterior and posterior.
2223976	2226030	265	A	1.0	And it seems to know quite a bit.
2227200	2235410	266	A	1.0	At least I understand, from people who work on Hydra about its own body, the state of its own body.
2240260	2249092	267	A	0.6063	So I think these are exactly the same kinds of questions that we should be asking, and they also apply at the scale that's much larger than us.
2249226	2263400	268	A	0.99997	So if we think about a human society, for example, as an agent, what can that agent measure, and what can that agent represent?
2264620	2270830	269	A	1.0	And how complex can that agent's cognition be?
2271600	2278360	270	A	0.95	And I think those questions are all essentially open.
2280170	2282678	271	A	0.99891	So, yeah, it's a great thought experiment.
2282854	2287020	272	A	1.0	I think it addresses exactly the questions that we're interested in addressing here.
2288430	2292940	273	B	0.99988	Thank you, Chris. Haris, and then anyone else with a raised hand.
2295090	2301120	274	E	1.0	Yes, thank you once again for allowing me to be here with all of you.
2302050	2303614	275	E	0.99967	Interesting, as always.
2303812	2312402	276	E	0.99996	So, I have a question that is related to this notion of the dual aspect of information.
2312536	2328230	277	E	0.99996	Basically that the meaning of formation is not just a matter of interpretation, but rather it is rooted in the physical properties of the system under investigation.
2328650	2346014	278	E	0.99989	So, basically, that, as I understand it, means translates that the meaning of information is not separate from the physical properties of the system under investigation, but it is rather an intrinsic part of it.
2346212	2361502	279	E	0.92644	So I am also familiar with this notion from the theory of computation called the Embrymersmann's limit.
2361646	2373810	280	E	1.0	That is a limit on the maximum rate of computation that can be achieved, let's say, in a self contained system within the material universe.
2373970	2391690	281	E	0.99995	So my question is, how can we parse, let's say, that sort of computational limit in terms of information processing?
2395090	2396080	282	A	0.99211	Thank you.
2408300	2415130	283	A	1.0	I am not sure that we can talk about a.
2421290	2431580	284	A	1.0	I think it's very difficult to talk about the classical information processing capability of the universe as a whole.
2436370	2445120	285	A	1.0	One has to impose some sort of classical description, and the question is, then, where does that description come from?
2445490	2453010	286	A	1.0	And from kind of whose point of view is that a description?
2453990	2474330	287	A	0.99995	But certainly, as soon as you partition the universe as a whole into some system and some other system, one can immediately talk about their information processing capabilities.
2476990	2489630	288	A	1.0	And then the question becomes quantum information processing capabilities versus classical information processing capabilities.
2491570	2508500	289	A	1.0	And if you're looking at classical information processing, to the extent that it's not reversible, it requires energy.
2509530	2515960	290	A	0.99	And so one can immediately derive limits based on the free energy access of that system.
2520420	2544550	291	A	0.99999	If you're talking about reversible information processing, which purely quantum information processing is, then you don't have that energetic requirement, but you also don't have a well defined answer in any classical, only the.
2545020	2560190	292	A	0.99889	If Alice is your system of interest that's able to do quantum information processing, then it's only her interaction partner, Bob, who can use her as a quantum computer.
2561120	2580340	293	A	0.99	And then his ability to employ Alice as a quantum computer is limited by his classical information processing capabilities because he has to define a classical input and a classical output.
2582840	2595130	294	A	0.55596	So I think this question becomes very complicated as soon as it is cast in these observer relative terms.
2600890	2604586	295	A	0.99896	But such limits clearly exist, right.
2604768	2607980	296	A	0.99998	They just require certain assumptions to define them.
2611160	2619690	297	E	0.99997	So quantum information can indeed be understood as a kind of dual to the classical information, right?
2624140	2624890	298	A	1.0	Yes.
2628300	2637660	299	A	0.65	And it's essentially one of these bulk boundary type dualities that seem now to be ubiquitous in physics.
2638160	2639550	300	A	0.95873	If we think of.
2640800	2662900	301	A	0.99992	Just think in terms of the holographic principle, you can have quantum processing going on in the bulk in the system that has a boundary and that can read classical information from the boundary and encode classical information on the boundary.
2663640	2671912	302	A	1.0	And quantitatively, the holographic principle tells you how much, right.
2671966	2676010	303	A	0.8	What can the maximum entropy, classical entropy of the boundary be?
2679200	2693890	304	A	0.99965	But what it doesn't tell you is anything about the semantics that either the system inside assigns to the information or any observer outside assigns to the information.
2695140	2697360	305	A	0.8333	It's just a quantitative statement.
2699140	2717850	306	A	0.99979	So in any setting that's characterized by that principle, the classical information on the boundary is dual in an interesting sense to the quantum processing that's going on inside.
2719980	2732430	307	A	0.99486	In that classical information on the boundary encodes everything that an external observer can know about what's going on on the.
2738760	2740964	308	A	0.59	Yeah, okay.
2741082	2744490	309	B	0.64	Yeah, Anna and then Dean after.
2749050	2749558	310	F	0.99913	Hi.
2749644	2750920	311	F	0.99998	Thank you very much.
2751850	2758040	312	F	0.96072	I'm also new to your active inference and your course.
2758990	2763530	313	F	1.0	I just want to say that unfortunately, I work with humans.
2767710	2772910	314	F	1.0	And I say unfortunately because the complexities are horrific.
2775970	2783200	315	F	0.99931	So having said that, maybe my question will make sense.
2784390	2801080	316	F	0.97915	So as I'm learning about quantum information theory and what I'm trying to do is assess, how can this help me answer questions that I have in the systems that I work with?
2802170	2822010	317	F	0.99995	My question is, in order to have a time arrow, irreversible process, don't you need to have a goal?
2825410	2831310	318	F	0.99991	My question is, does it matter to even worry about goals?
2831970	2849160	319	F	0.99546	Because as I listen to all the descriptions and I think about Alice and Bob and systems, I immediately think about, well, so much of what we're talking about depends upon the goal of the system.
2850250	2863690	320	F	1.0	And in some very abstract way, it seems to me that there is a goal that's driving the need for the boundary, the need for the communication.
2866190	2878080	321	F	1.0	And so I'm so obsessed with this question that I wanted to ask it early on before I proceed with my learning.
2881330	2883600	322	A	1.0	Yeah, that's a very good question.
2884710	2907640	323	A	0.77	You can think of the whole free energy principle as a way of describing physical systems in a way that makes their behavior as agents obvious.
2909290	2923370	324	A	0.9	And so you could state the FEP by saying that every system has a goal, and its goal is minimizing prediction error.
2925730	2943490	325	A	0.74831	Or to put it positively, its goal is to predict and therefore respond to its environment's actions in a way that preserves its own identity.
2944070	2952294	326	A	0.88	And I don't know whether you've read much of Carl Friston's work, but he uses the word self evidencing a lot.
2952492	2962046	327	A	0.68026	He says the goal of any system is to generate evidence of its own existence, which sounds very psychological.
2962178	2969930	328	A	0.54	And Carl, interestingly enough, studied first as a psychiatrist.
2970750	2979120	329	A	0.99527	So I expect that his point of view is actually very consonant with your question and where you're coming from.
2983410	2984206	330	F	0.49889	Started.
2984388	2984974	331	F	0.67147	I'm sorry.
2985012	2986160	332	F	0.52	I didn't mean to.
2986770	2987502	333	A	0.63544	No, no.
2987556	2988160	334	A	0.99968	Go.
2989170	2990206	335	F	0.78	I started.
2990388	3009190	336	F	0.51741	I've spent some time reading Chris Weisson's ideas and work on the free energy principle and self evidencing.
3009610	3012970	337	F	1.0	And, yes, I will continue to dig deep.
3013950	3015690	338	F	0.97	The problem is.
3015760	3027310	339	F	0.8117	So I'm an anthropologist, and I've worked with Indigenous peoples and spent 20 years of my life living in these small scale societies.
3031170	3033550	340	F	1.0	One of my observations is that.
3033620	3036110	341	F	0.78	And that I find really fascinating.
3038230	3038546	342	C	0.9943	But.
3038568	3041522	343	F	0.99989	We don't have a good understanding of it.
3041576	3059394	344	F	1.0	And that's why I decided to dig into physics as information processing, which is that goals are constantly being negotiated, and it's more along the lines.
3059522	3080350	345	F	0.97054	So, Michael Levine's work actually was what led me to explore quantum information theory, which is like this collective intelligences that exist within systems.
3080770	3103014	346	F	1.0	And so, at each level of collective intelligence, it's not just that you have a collective intelligence dictating a goal, but that those goals are being negotiated as the environments change and as relationships between the systems change.
3103212	3120460	347	F	0.99994	So I know these are very big questions, but if you could just help me, give me some thoughts on what your thoughts have been about these kinds of questions.
3123630	3154210	348	A	0.89	Yeah, I think you're pointing to something very important here, and this is a question that this kind of free energy, principle based work motivates immediately when you consider a system that comprises a bunch of subsystems.
3157290	3169930	349	A	1.0	I work with Michael Levin at Tufts in developmental biology, and one of his slogans is all intelligence as collective.
3171150	3184190	350	A	1.0	And that immediately brings up this issue of how do these components, as you put it, negotiate their goals?
3184530	3187162	351	A	0.99997	How do they collaborate?
3187226	3188414	352	A	0.99998	How do they compete?
3188542	3194740	353	A	1.0	To what extent are they trying to deceive each other or coerce each other or all of this?
3195430	3206226	354	A	1.0	And we're trying to apply this in a cell Biology context as a description of development and morphogenesis.
3206338	3219930	355	A	0.99992	If you think about cells in a developing organism, they're constantly facing new environments, their capabilities are constantly changing, and how they interact with each other is constantly changing.
3220270	3224170	356	A	1.0	And this all seems very psychological or sociological.
3225730	3243758	357	A	0.82201	So I think what you're pointing to is the ubiquitous need for this kind of language in areas other than the human sciences.
3243854	3255458	358	A	0.65	I mean, it's language that's developed within the human sciences, but it's language that seems to be important at much smaller scales.
3255634	3265100	359	A	1.0	And clearly, one would anticipate it being important in much larger scales, the scales of countries or civilizations or whatever.
3266990	3271642	360	A	0.71057	So I guess my answer is yes.
3271696	3281760	361	A	1.0	This is an extremely important point of view with very broad implications for how we think about biology, at least.
3283970	3284958	362	F	0.99268	Thank you.
3285124	3286000	363	B	0.98454	Thank you.
3287750	3292290	364	B	0.99987	Definitely looking forward to your continued learnings and journey.
3292870	3295250	365	B	0.97763	Thank you, Dean.
3297430	3303430	366	G	1.0	Yeah, my question has changed three times because just the other questions that have come up in the meantime.
3306010	3308360	367	G	0.99066	So some context here.
3308730	3311782	368	G	0.99544	Chris, you've kind of answered this.
3311836	3313686	369	G	1.0	You mentioned dual, as in dual.
3313708	3320714	370	G	0.89	And then Anna brought up like, is there some kind of competition, a dual, A-D-U-E-L going on?
3320752	3322442	371	G	0.98	And how do we put those two things together?
3322496	3325882	372	G	0.8	And me always thumping the table about minimum two.
3325936	3332206	373	G	0.99737	We have to keep at least two truisms up at once if we're going to gain some sense around things.
3332308	3341326	374	G	0.99	I want to go back to that lock Loc slide, if we can, for a second, because, Chris, you mentioned your statement was, you draw a boundary.
3341358	3345380	375	G	0.93	And to me, there's a lot of information packed in those four words.
3347590	3351106	376	G	1.0	You can draw and you can undraw, you can bound, you can unbound.
3351298	3357030	377	G	0.99999	Those are perfectly contextless subject matter, information carrying.
3358970	3359830	378	A	0.99808	Frames.
3360170	3373850	379	G	0.99996	But you also have in that packet, you and at which are imperfect orientations, an indefinite article, and all of us occupying a slide here, none of us claiming to be anything other than a contradiction.
3374290	3392286	380	G	0.99954	So one aspect of that packet, two words of it, literally half of it, is perfectly contextless and is information carrying, and the other, literally half of that is prediction matter or information graphing.
3392398	3400458	381	G	0.99987	It's literally the byproduct or the spacetime construct that is included.
3400654	3410402	382	G	0.99931	So I guess what I'm wondering is, how do we make these different matters, the subject matter and the prediction matter tango, how do we get them to relate?
3410466	3415814	383	G	0.99945	Because in the session five, you went on a detour.
3415862	3422614	384	G	1.0	You said, we'll take a detour, which is it holds the exact same structure as you draw a boundary.
3422742	3429082	385	G	0.99996	So there's perfect information and there's imperfect information in that they're dancing.
3429226	3431006	386	G	0.99994	We do this all the time.
3431188	3435326	387	G	0.97	This seems to me, at a minimum, what information theory is.
3435508	3448158	388	G	1.0	And that's why I want to kind of go back to this slide, because this slide was in a much earlier session, but it got to session five, where the context could be recapitulated.
3448334	3459480	389	G	1.0	And so I'm wondering whether or not we can really talk about quantum information without the classical, or if that's even possible.
3462730	3466614	390	A	0.99985	Well, I'll go back to Boris statement.
3466662	3472780	391	A	0.99976	In his 1928 paper, he basically said, the answer to that question is no.
3474850	3478154	392	A	1.0	That we are humans.
3478202	3479902	393	A	0.99998	We have to communicate with each other.
3479956	3485070	394	A	0.99999	We have to do it in language, and that's classical communication.
3485810	3506790	395	A	0.97	And while we are doing that, while we're having this conversation, we can't be worried about the question of, do I still exist or do you still exist?
3507690	3521850	396	A	0.99992	We can worry about that question, but we can't do it at the same time that we're having this conversation about the theory of lock protocols or exchanging data from a Bell EPR experiment.
3522990	3527470	397	A	0.99	And that's, of course, deeply paradoxical.
3529490	3534000	398	A	1.0	And I think that's just the situation we're in.
3534450	3538690	399	A	0.5983	He said, none of us are claiming to be anything other than a contradiction.
3539510	3549540	400	A	0.99993	It's a Good thing that we are self conscious about the fact that we're doing something contradictory here, or potentially contradictory here.
3551370	3559190	401	A	1.0	A colleague and I wrote a paper several years ago called science generates limit paradoxes.
3560490	3570780	402	A	1.0	And we basically rehearsed a version of this very discussion that we're having right now.
3572590	3589490	403	A	0.59	And the upshot of that paper is that in any situation in which a science can turn its theoretical apparatus onto its own practice.
3590470	3608050	404	A	0.86704	So, for example, when physics can turn this analysis of boundaries onto the practice of physics, then it generates paradoxes.
3608870	3630270	405	A	1.0	And those paradoxes have a particular structure, which is the structure that priest, I can't remember his first name, a logician who works in non dialectic logic, calls a limit paradox.
3630930	3635946	406	A	0.92	And all of this is coupled to Gertle's theorem.
3636058	3643330	407	A	1.0	And these other paradoxes of self reference are aspects of self reference.
3645590	3650550	408	A	0.99998	But I think this situation really is ubiquitous and inescapable.
3651210	3695700	409	A	1.0	That as soon as we apply the tools of science to the practice of science, we generate these paradoxical situations in which we have to acknowledge that we are entities of a certain sort, and that we are constructing our theories using a faculty of imagination that lets us act as if we don't have a point of view.
3698790	3703910	410	A	0.99989	So it lets us act as if what we're talking about is point of view, independent.
3705770	3712220	411	A	0.99984	But our theories themselves tell us that we have points of view and that they're important.
3713070	3716300	412	A	0.99995	So we're stuck in this paradoxical situation.
3716670	3728160	413	A	1.0	I don't know whether that's what you're trying to point to here, but it's what I immediately leaped to hearing what you said.
3739420	3741160	414	B	1.0	Yeah, a lot there.
3741230	3743610	415	B	0.99997	Anyone else want to add a piece?
3750220	3751528	416	A	0.57	Yeah, I'm going to have to go.
3751614	3753188	417	B	0.93955	So thank you, Chris.
3753284	3754828	418	B	0.80199	We'll stay for a few minutes.
3754914	3755484	419	B	0.99992	Thank you, though.
3755522	3756268	420	B	1.0	This was awesome.
3756354	3758430	421	B	0.91733	We're really looking forward to lecture six.
3759840	3763836	422	A	0.62	Okay, thank you all, and thank you all for attending this discussion session.
3763868	3764108	423	A	0.68472	It's.
3764124	3773420	424	A	0.94943	It's nice to have this kind of real time discussion which is missing during the actual lecture sessions.
3773500	3774912	425	A	0.99766	So I appreciate it.
3775046	3776108	426	A	0.99717	Thanks again.
3776294	3776884	427	A	0.98623	SEe you.
3776922	3777620	428	F	0.80629	Thank you.
3777770	3778980	429	C	0.99209	Thank you, Chris.
3781480	3783824	430	B	0.53554	Thank you, Kate.
3783872	3785476	431	B	0.96672	Do you want to ask anything, or.
3785498	3789210	432	B	0.99986	Anyone can just bring up anything they're thinking right now.
3790780	3792088	433	H	0.99998	Nothing in particular.
3792174	3798090	434	H	0.99694	I'm just really looking forward to the last lecture on the biology of it all.
3801760	3802510	435	D	0.99992	Great.
3805680	3815250	436	B	0.99973	Well, any other thoughts or questions, or if anyone in the live chat has a thought or a question, they can write it and we'll read it in the coming minutes.
3818260	3821810	437	F	0.83581	Well, I just wanted to thank you for creating the space.
3823060	3841850	438	F	0.73425	It's been absolutely amazing that I was able to find this situation where people are talking about enormous questions and very difficult questions.
3846860	3853960	439	F	1.0	I just thought I'd share that I find in academia.
3857360	3860780	440	F	0.75	I don't know why we're not having these conversations.
3861280	3863230	441	F	0.87	And I've been.
3863940	3869970	442	F	0.95217	It's been like a ten year journey, and I have finally found this group.
3870660	3874160	443	F	1.0	I just wanted to express my gratitude.
3875960	3876950	444	B	0.9984	Thank you.
3878120	3882660	445	B	0.91197	I'll read a question from the live chat and anyone can give their thoughts.
3883320	3892500	446	B	0.9996	So, Mills 81 two wrote, it seems that concilience would aim to ameliorate the problems of self reference.
3892660	3896760	447	B	0.9999	Is this a category of solution that seems valuable or fraught?
3900630	3904870	448	B	0.99981	Could concilience ameliorate the problems of self reference?
3911030	3913426	449	C	1.0	Yes, Dean, can I just ask a.
3913448	3915010	450	G	0.99997	Different question built on that?
3915080	3922470	451	G	0.99919	Which is, what if the contradiction is a feature as opposed to a fraughtness?
3928260	3929600	452	B	0.99981	Do I contradict myself?
3929670	3930384	453	B	0.99999	Very well, then.
3930422	3931564	454	B	1.0	I contain multitudes.
3931612	3936100	455	B	0.99986	There's the Whitman angle, then there's the William Blake.
3936760	3940100	456	B	1.0	Life is a fiction and is made up of contradiction.
3940440	3944820	457	B	0.99855	So what is the problem of self reference?
3949770	3951398	458	B	0.91879	Whose problem is it?
3951484	3952310	459	B	0.85886	Haris?
3953130	3965850	460	E	0.99	Yeah, I will try to answer a bit, to tackle a bit both questions by offering my views from the cognitive science perspective.
3966350	3979614	461	E	0.99995	Basically, I think it has to do with consilience, has to do with the numerous cognitive bias that we all are, let's say, subjected to.
3979732	3987954	462	E	0.99984	So there is a very long list of cognitive biases, and there are more than 100 listed, I think.
3988152	4002178	463	E	0.99321	So this is one of the challenges in terms of achieving, let's say, good levels of consilience across various domains.
4002354	4005400	464	E	0.72979	So this is what I wanted to add.
4009720	4010756	465	B	0.99999	Another thought on.
4010778	4016340	466	B	1.0	That is consilience, though it can mean many things, synthesis.
4017800	4020410	467	B	0.7574	Sorry, yeah, please, Donna, go ahead.
4022940	4032108	468	F	0.99	I don't really have insights into the self referencing problem.
4032194	4034910	469	F	1.0	I need to do a lot of thinking about that.
4036400	4069316	470	F	0.72734	But coming from training in evolutionary biology and spending graduate school, postgraduate school, working on explanations where we thought of many hypotheses, models, et cetera, based on a goal, which is organisms are designed to maximize their fitness.
4069508	4073850	471	F	0.87	And, of course, we know that there are lots of problems with that.
4074620	4083244	472	F	1.0	And it turns out, with our data, what we found is that was not the case in the populations that we're working with.
4083362	4087180	473	F	1.0	Too often, the goal did not seem to be fitness.
4090020	4108470	474	F	0.9997	But what that experience gave me is that there was something we could hang on to in order to allow ourselves to propose models for why humans behave the way they do and the decisions that they make.
4110360	4123850	475	F	0.99776	So that's why I go back to goals, because if at whatever level of collective intelligence we're talking about, there is a.
4125820	4133500	476	F	0.82	And Haris, please let me know if this would be correct, that even cognitive biases exist.
4133920	4143360	477	F	0.99884	They exist because there is some goal, and therefore we can talk about cognitive biases with respect to some goal.
4146180	4146880	478	C	1.0	Yes.
4147030	4158832	479	E	0.75117	There is some sort of telenomy in conscious agents, or personal systems, as I call them, and it has to do with goals.
4158896	4166404	480	E	0.9	Yes, and cognitive biases and the limitations on the knowledge.
4166452	4174344	481	E	0.99587	Let's say, maybe it's limitations on parts of the knowledge representation that each of us has.
4174542	4187052	482	E	1.0	Maybe there are limitations in terms of access to knowing, and there are various forms of knowing, so it depends on many things.
4187106	4208230	483	E	0.99	And, for example, one of the cognitive bias that I believe can have a negative impact on consilience, let's say, in addressing this self referentiality will be the Halo effect.
4209160	4237710	484	E	0.66928	So where you seem to prioritize, let's say, or give some advantage to some types of individuals, ideas, or even theories because of that, hell, for whatever reason that is, it is based on maybe on many different things, maybe on your past history or other.
4238800	4239550	485	E	0.7	Yeah.
4242180	4244124	486	H	0.94197	Thank you, Anna.
4244172	4247580	487	H	0.98	And if I may add something rather briefly.
4247660	4253144	488	H	0.93248	Your question reminded me of Levin's, and I think it was written with Phil.
4253292	4269908	489	H	0.48	The proposal about reduction of stress as a goal that guides the emergence of collective structures is one of the papers formulated that seems to be the goal that drives things as they grow in complexity.
4270004	4274090	490	H	0.99755	Reduction of collective stress or reduction of stress at any level.
4274620	4280300	491	H	0.97	Yeah, I don't remember the title of the paper, but that was the gist of it, if I understood it correctly.
4282080	4282828	492	F	0.99981	Thank you.
4282914	4284092	493	F	0.96639	I'll look that up.
4284226	4284910	494	F	0.9809	Great.
4286160	4296380	495	B	0.99996	Another piece of the Levinson Fields collaboration that Chris alluded to earlier is that the notion of computation is observer dependent.
4296460	4297916	496	B	0.99718	That's polycomputation.
4298028	4306868	497	B	0.99916	If there was a fully encrypted computation, an observer without the key would only be seeing noise to them.
4307034	4314224	498	B	0.93093	Whereas if they were to have the decryption key, then they could fully understand and go into more detail about the computation.
4314352	4329470	499	B	0.99988	So then let's say that we're in relation or observing or investigating some life phenomena at some scale, but we're speaking in the scale free setting, but we're observing a thing that's there.
4330960	4344076	500	B	0.68	People have ascribed different goals to describe what we call goal oriented behavior, like seemingly to survive or seemingly to have evolutionary fitness.
4344268	4351260	501	B	1.0	However, one, an observer could also project different proximate goals.
4351340	4357700	502	B	1.0	Like the goal to minimize stress, the goal to minimize free energy, the goal to minimize surprise.
4358120	4369000	503	B	0.53241	Those proximate observer proposed goals as if goals may be exactly isomorphic or aligned with fitness maximization.
4369580	4374836	504	B	0.99994	So that could just be multiple perspectives of projective goals.
4375028	4389212	505	B	1.0	And whatever the observer projects, that doesn't mean it describes the actual process of the phenomena at all.
4389346	4390444	506	B	0.90275	There's just nothing.
4390562	4393804	507	B	0.99353	Alice can make any story about Bob.
4393932	4403904	508	B	0.99	And it may or may not have anything to do or even be possible to be of the kind that Bob tells about is.
4404022	4405316	509	G	0.99	I want to just piggyback on that.
4405338	4407716	510	G	0.67843	Daniel, this is really hugely important.
4407898	4415880	511	G	1.0	The moment you use the word goals or the moment you use the word fitness, you are assuming context.
4416540	4426810	512	G	0.98386	Whereas a lot of this stuff that's happening on this holographic screen is completely abstractless, abstracted and completely context less.
4427280	4430140	513	G	0.99924	There's no context required.
4430960	4447056	514	G	0.99994	So if you're going to focus on that part of it, as long as you can juggle both at the same time and keep the two things apart, because one does not require context, the other completely assumes that context is given.
4447158	4450412	515	G	1.0	And now you're taking that into your calculus.
4450476	4450848	516	G	0.97497	Right?
4450934	4452290	517	G	0.99966	But they're not the same.
4453080	4453732	518	A	0.791	I'm just.
4453786	4456470	519	G	0.6	I want to reinforce what Daniel just said.
4457560	4459140	520	B	0.99601	Thank you, Dean Ian.
4463800	4464710	521	B	0.59106	Then continue.
4466780	4467304	522	D	0.99938	Thank you.
4467342	4473064	523	D	1.0	Yeah, I was just maybe reinforcing what you were saying or reflecting on it.
4473102	4482700	524	D	1.0	I was thinking about the behaviors we see in other animals and even ourselves that we might not think are related to fitness.
4483120	4507860	525	D	0.97906	Like, I don't know, there's those kind of gazelle type creatures that just jump into the air, but they seem to do that at a time which might make them be predated upon by some tiger or lion, which then all the sort of biologists try and figure out how is this related to fitness?
4508360	4509668	526	D	0.69	And we may do the same.
4509754	4514336	527	D	0.99956	If I go and mow my lawn, waste half a Sunday afternoon, mowing my lawn.
4514368	4516004	528	D	0.99712	What's that got to do with my fitness?
4516052	4521588	529	D	0.99947	Well, actually, it's to do with keeping up with the Joneses and my social status.
4521764	4527064	530	D	0.9928	So it's really hard to actually know what my behavior is about.
4527262	4536684	531	D	1.0	I can create a story to say that it's to do with minimizing free energy or fitness, but really, is it or not?
4536722	4537388	532	D	1.0	I don't know.
4537474	4541890	533	D	0.99996	Is that kind of what you were getting at or something different?
4543380	4544624	534	B	1.0	Yeah, it's a great point.
4544662	4548720	535	B	0.64	And also, it's come up several times about goals.
4549060	4553756	536	B	1.0	The term goal is not to be found within the active inference ontology.
4553868	4559120	537	B	0.99731	Strictly speaking, that's why we have so much fun with what we expect and what we prefer.
4559280	4564192	538	B	0.99998	How can it be what we expect and be the positive thing that we pursue?
4564336	4566900	539	B	0.99984	Well, that's how paths of least action work.
4567050	4577508	540	B	1.0	And then if somebody else wants to look at that path of least action and say, well, here was a mile point, and this is where it looked like they were heading north, and this is where it looked like the goal was to evade this.
4577694	4585640	541	B	0.52888	Those are all stories that an observer could tell about a path, or that the path might tell itself about its own path.
4585800	4597388	542	B	0.99993	But those goal narratives don't need to be implemented proximally or primally with goals.
4597484	4606372	543	B	0.67344	As a kind of core player in the active inference ontology, I'll read some of these great comments and questions.
4606426	4610870	544	B	0.95666	Just if anybody has a thought on them from the live chat, just feel free.
4612120	4615832	545	B	0.99878	John Reed wrote, what does the active inference group?
4615886	4619130	546	B	1.0	I think that's us, but includes everyone.
4619500	4622084	547	B	0.99983	Think about the equation of pilot wave.
4622212	4626436	548	B	0.99961	With many worlds recently expounded upon by Chris O'Dowd at PBS.
4626548	4634220	549	B	1.0	I found it to be mixing terms and frustrating personally, any thoughts on pilot wave and many worlds?
4634640	4653700	550	B	0.87	And I would also just be curious on the physics or technical side, where does what Chris is sharing connect to these kinds of discussions that people have about many worlds and different interpretations of quantum?
4657940	4659472	551	C	1.0	Yeah, that's a great question.
4659526	4661890	552	C	0.99901	So I don't know that I can answer it.
4663060	4687770	553	C	1.0	I know that when it comes to interpretations of quantum mechanics, whether the collapse or the many worlds or whatever, I think what they're hinting at, and Chris would probably answer something along those lines, that quantum theory is fundamentally about information.
4688140	4703820	554	C	0.94	And until we make sense of that fully and fully spell out all the details, I think these philosophical issues or the interpretations of quantum mechanics are going to linger.
4704420	4715884	555	C	0.97	I don't have any strong thoughts on interpretations, and I would say I'm an agnostic about interpretations of quantum mechanics.
4716012	4723120	556	C	1.0	I don't know that I subscribe to any of and especially pilot wave.
4723280	4726230	557	C	0.99	I don't have the slightest idea about it.
4727080	4727876	558	A	0.98687	Cool.
4728058	4728980	559	B	0.89212	Harris?
4729420	4729784	560	E	0.98	Yes.
4729822	4734724	561	E	0.99829	If you allow me, I have a small story regarding pilot wave.
4734852	4753244	562	E	1.0	I was conversing with Chat GPT and I actually asked what it thought about Pilot wave after watching a lecture on it and then I got intrigued and I wanted to ask and this actually happened.
4753442	4758828	563	E	1.0	The model started replying and I got the chance to read a bit the reply.
4758924	4766300	564	E	1.0	And the reply was like, it is very interesting, but most probably is not correct, it is wrong.
4766470	4771872	565	E	1.0	And then it must have reached some sort of information goal.
4772016	4776516	566	E	0.99999	It retracted the reply and it replied to me.
4776538	4778230	567	E	0.99984	Can you ask me a different question?
4778840	4784980	568	E	0.99983	So this is my short experience with pilot wave theory.
4786280	4787176	569	G	0.71284	Can I ask a question?
4787198	4790520	570	G	0.84086	Is a pilot wave more or less than 100ft in height?
4793280	4796350	571	B	0.97	I think it's exactly 100.
4800480	4803550	572	B	0.99996	Any other thoughts or questions?
4805040	4810270	573	B	0.99993	It's a fun and lively live chat too, which is always fun.
4815690	4831140	574	B	1.0	Yeah, well, we are it coming right along in the year and now five, six completed with this course.
4831670	4838430	575	B	0.71714	So any comments that anyone here just wants to make in a closing round?
4838510	4841220	576	B	0.99983	Anybody who wants to can go for it.
4843290	4844920	577	F	0.63	Yeah, I have a question.
4845370	4850870	578	F	0.89775	If questions come up, have come up during the session.
4853130	4853880	579	C	1.0	Yes.
4855770	4858060	580	F	1.0	Who could I send them to and how?
4858830	4860140	581	B	0.99999	Great question.
4860750	4868470	582	B	0.99984	In the video description, you can get to the syllabus of the course and one of the pages on the course website.
4868560	4871422	583	B	0.97181	Course syllabus is a question and answer form.
4871556	4879818	584	B	0.98719	So you'll see several dozen questions that people have already written and Chris gives answers and then it's publicly posted.
4879994	4886500	585	B	0.99973	All of the lectures, discussions and questions and answers will be published after the course.
4887190	4894674	586	B	0.99998	So every question, no matter from where or where to all of these questions are encouraged.
4894722	4899110	587	B	0.73695	It only makes it a richer and more relevant publication.
4900010	4901000	588	F	0.99725	Thank you.
4905470	4908170	589	B	0.51	Okay, Ian Harris or Dean?
4912370	4912782	590	C	0.88	Yes.
4912836	4914906	591	B	0.89009	Susan also says post in discord.
4915018	4915920	592	B	0.99979	Great point.
4918210	4923070	593	E	0.99	Yeah, I just wanted to add a small point as a conclusion.
4923230	4940642	594	E	0.99974	From my personal perspective, I really find that the ideas of Chris Fields, they can be revolutionary, let's say in a variety of different fields.
4940786	4954310	595	E	1.0	And I can see it in quantum cryptography and also about what I've mentioned before in terms of quantum knowledge representation.
4954470	4958822	596	E	0.99991	So these are the two fields that I can clearly see it.
4958896	4964650	597	E	0.94722	So it is great to be able to participate in this conversation.
4964810	4966800	598	E	0.99612	So once again, thanks to everyone.
4968930	4975890	599	B	0.99984	Great to participate in this conversation or quantum knowledge representation, whichever you prefer.
4978070	4980450	600	B	0.5036	Ander, any last comments?
4983990	4984690	601	C	0.99901	Not really.
4984760	4986322	602	C	0.99988	Just looking forward to the next one.
4986376	4987140	603	A	0.91	I guess.
4989190	4990242	604	C	0.94	I should say.
4990376	4992530	605	C	0.97	And what next year?
4992600	4994500	606	C	1.0	This is going to be an ongoing thing.
4994950	4996438	607	A	1.0	Yes, we'll.
4996454	4998780	608	C	0.57754	We'll come back stronger next year, for sure.
5001630	5002474	609	B	0.99	Okay.
5002672	5003862	610	B	1.0	What a ride.
5004006	5004954	611	B	0.99992	Thank you all.
5005072	5006954	612	B	0.99995	See you next time.
5007152	5007930	613	B	0.7661	Bye.
5009790	5010860	614	E	0.95888	Bye, everyone.
5011470	5011830	615	A	0.67499	Bye.
