1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,700
You.

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,006
Hello and welcome, everyone. It's

3
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:12,594
September 30, 2023, and we are in

4
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:14,574
physics as information processing

5
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:17,090
discussion five should be a fun

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,930
discussion on a great fifth lecture.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,802
So, Andre, if you'd like to give some

8
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:28,074
opening remarks, and then also anyone

9
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:29,770
else, whether it's your first time

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,506
joining a discussion or not, it would be

11
00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:35,894
great to hear your remarks on lecture

12
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:39,898
five or just where you're coming at it

13
00:00:39,984 --> 00:00:42,270
today. So first though, Andre.

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,550
Sure. Hello, Daniel. So I

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,366
may as well start off by sharing the

16
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:52,320
slides, right? What do you think?

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,346
Sure. So just before,

18
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:00,658
as a warm up, let's review some of the

19
00:01:00,664 --> 00:01:02,580
things that Chris mentioned last time.

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,154
So near the beginning,

21
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:10,002
the main thing was this distinction

22
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,526
between reductionist and scale free

23
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:12,230
theories.

24
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,570
Obviously, one very salient feature of

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,986
the free energy literature is that it

26
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:25,274
falls under scale free theories. These

27
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:29,494
are theories where there is no preferred

28
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:32,510
scale of energy or distance.

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,606
Reductionist theories are based on

30
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:40,446
such a scale existing. Right. You want

31
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:43,046
to break the pieces into the fundamental

32
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:45,700
building blocks of the Legos. People

33
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,126
think of usually high energy or particle

34
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:51,220
physics as the archetype of this thing,

35
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,990
whereas in scale three theories,

36
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,334
there is no such thing, and we should

37
00:01:59,372 --> 00:02:02,498
have the same skeletons

38
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:05,590
or the same framework at different

39
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,550
scales.

40
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,660
This is going to be very important.

41
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,058
Chris, correct me if I'm wrong, but

42
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:16,266
especially for the coming lecture where

43
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:18,374
we talk about biology, Chris himself

44
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:21,982
made a few remarks on how the

45
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:25,886
renormalization group flow, aka the

46
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:28,750
process of going from smaller to higher

47
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,246
scale, may be trivial in biology. That

48
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:33,922
is to say that there is a self

49
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:37,266
similarity. Okay, so some features of

50
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:39,954
biology should remain invariant at

51
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:43,678
different scales. That is what cells

52
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:47,334
are to a body, different individuals of

53
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:49,650
a species might be to an ecosystem,

54
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,542
that sort of idea. So after talking

55
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:58,486
at scale, and perhaps when

56
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:00,454
we get to the question parts, I guess

57
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:02,090
this is the one thing that I would like

58
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,166
Chris to explain a little more precisely

59
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:08,294
what these diagrams mean. I have a rough

60
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:10,486
idea, but it would be nice to hear him

61
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:12,990
talk about that again. Anyways,

62
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,000
in the second half, basically.

63
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,790
We. Started asking, as is the theme

64
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,242
in this course, so far from first

65
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:27,234
principles, what do you need to talk

66
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:30,562
about? Space and time.

67
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:34,046
And there were some theorizing

68
00:03:34,078 --> 00:03:37,258
that time might be more fundamental.

69
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:40,406
That is, the things that you need to

70
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,694
implement a clock. We're thinking about

71
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:44,966
what are the most basic constituents to

72
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:47,494
implement a clock? And those may be even

73
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:50,506
more basic than the things you need to

74
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:53,386
implement QRFs or perception of space.

75
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:56,954
After all, it seems like you need some

76
00:03:56,992 --> 00:04:00,646
spatial extension to perceive

77
00:04:00,678 --> 00:04:02,666
a space in the first place. I can't

78
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:04,926
remember if it was somebody who was

79
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:07,102
tuning in for the lecture or a question

80
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:10,606
afterwards or something like that. But I

81
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:13,502
think this remark gets to a very deep

82
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:17,954
point. Somebody I recall mentioned that

83
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:19,966
some organisms, it might have been Chris

84
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:22,610
himself. I can't remember, really that

85
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,058
there are organisms, you may know the

86
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,774
name, Daniel, that are so tiny that if

87
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:31,110
they try to implement a gradient,

88
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,014
to try to chase their food or whatever,

89
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:36,646
they're so small that they can't even

90
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:40,186
perceive the gradient. Any attempt at

91
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,090
implementing such perception,

92
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,386
they're going to feel the same amount of

93
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:48,746
concentration in all directions. So

94
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:50,358
they're basically not large enough to

95
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:53,434
perceive space. However, interestingly,

96
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:56,478
so, they can perceive time. I don't know

97
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:59,962
how this ties to the remarks that Chris

98
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:02,186
made about space being more fundamental.

99
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,826
I suppose Chris was getting at

100
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,466
the point that you need fewer parts to

101
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,490
perceive space. And the fact that such

102
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,358
small organisms can perceive time

103
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:17,362
but not space, I guess, is further

104
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:19,350
empirical evidence for this thesis.

105
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,822
Actually, Andrew, if I can. Yes,

106
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:27,190
please. I may not botch the explanation.

107
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,586
Yeah. I proposed earlier that time is

108
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:32,250
actually more fundamental than space,

109
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,946
that one has to have time to

110
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:39,094
be able to see space. So that's further

111
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:41,774
on in these slides. That issue is

112
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:45,006
discussed. Yeah. Do you

113
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,150
want to say something about duckers?

114
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, this is the right slide.

115
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,280
Yeah. One just needs a memory,

116
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,284
really, to have

117
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,120
a clock, an external clock,

118
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,440
to have an internal clock.

119
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,736
One also has to have a memory to have an

120
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:14,880
internal clock. But if you have a memory

121
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,344
and there's some kind of activity

122
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:22,656
that's periodic

123
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:24,468
in the environment, then you have a

124
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:27,060
clock, an external clock,

125
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,964
but you don't need object identity to

126
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:34,840
have a clock. And that's

127
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,856
what distinguishes it from space. You

128
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:42,296
have to have object identity, or in

129
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,236
other words, motion. The ability to

130
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:46,830
perceive motion, to perceive space.

131
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,430
Right.

132
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,024
Yeah. Any periodic behavior is

133
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:58,636
effectively a clock. Whereas for

134
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:02,024
space, we need object persistence,

135
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:05,340
which two comments that we've made

136
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,728
were that object persistence,

137
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:12,236
or rather Chris made, is the defining

138
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:14,736
feature of classicality. You said that

139
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:16,930
last time. Is that right, Chris? And

140
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,224
also that object persistence is

141
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:24,736
precisely the notion of thinness, the

142
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:28,560
way freestone would put. Yeah,

143
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,456
yeah. Object persistence is definitely a

144
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:35,256
classical notion, and it does seem to be

145
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:39,124
the place where classicality enters.

146
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:42,264
Quantum theory, as far as I can tell,

147
00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:43,880
is with this notion of object

148
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,912
persistence that that's the most

149
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,516
fundamental place that it enters. So how

150
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:52,444
does that definition of, or rather,

151
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:54,396
relationship between classicality and

152
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:58,092
quantumness being object

153
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:00,216
persistence, how does it compare with

154
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:03,296
other accounts coming from QdaR and

155
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:05,010
decoherence and all of that?

156
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,184
Well, say quantum Darwinism is a good

157
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:14,864
example. Quantum Darwinism assumes

158
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,540
object persistence. It assumes that

159
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,932
there is some persistent thing that

160
00:08:20,986 --> 00:08:23,460
interacts over time with the environment

161
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,904
according to some interaction that has

162
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:33,156
fixed eigenvalues. So quantum

163
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:36,088
Darwinism already assumes object

164
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:39,256
persistence, and it also assumes

165
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:41,416
classical communication, as we discussed

166
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:44,444
a couple of times ago, in that it's a

167
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,312
theory that is about the ability

168
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:52,464
of multiple observers to agree about the

169
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:55,890
state of some other object,

170
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,136
which for them to agree about that

171
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:01,744
object, not only does the object need to

172
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:04,932
persist, the various observers need

173
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:07,604
to have the same description of that

174
00:09:07,642 --> 00:09:10,964
object, or the same name for that

175
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:13,264
object, or the same way of identifying

176
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:17,540
that object. So, yeah, Quantum Darwinism

177
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,492
actually assumes a lot of classical

178
00:09:19,556 --> 00:09:20,440
features.

179
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,196
The basic theory of environmental

180
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:30,060
decoherence is, in effect, a single

181
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,276
observer theory. So it doesn't have to

182
00:09:33,298 --> 00:09:35,276
assume classical communication, but it

183
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:37,180
does assume object persistence,

184
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,316
which obviously, if you're going to talk

185
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:44,856
about empirical science, you have to.

186
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:48,208
You have to assume that your detector is

187
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:50,544
a thing that persists through time, or

188
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:52,736
you can't do an experiment. And more

189
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,096
importantly than that, you have to

190
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:55,824
assume that you're a thing that persists

191
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:56,710
through time.

192
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,236
So we need these classical notions to

193
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:04,820
talk about doing science.

194
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,406
I'm not the first person to point that

195
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:11,986
out, of course. I mean, Bohr pointed

196
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:14,934
that out in 1928 in his paper in

197
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:17,826
Science, where he summarizes quantum

198
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:21,420
theory. So it's a very old idea,

199
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,234
right. And I guess right away

200
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:27,946
I have a question that I suspect I may

201
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:30,426
have asked before, but maybe we can

202
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,866
revisit it from the perspective

203
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:36,734
of today's discussion, which is, and

204
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:39,726
maybe I should pull the slide, this is

205
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:43,178
actually from session four. So if we're

206
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:49,826
talking about differences between what

207
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:52,100
the defining feature of classicality is,

208
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,738
to me, that bears the question of here,

209
00:10:56,824 --> 00:11:00,482
right, this TQFT diagrammatic

210
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:03,878
notation for the classical and the

211
00:11:03,884 --> 00:11:05,654
quantum channels. So if we're talking

212
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:07,890
about object persistence as the defining

213
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,178
feature of classicality, and this is the

214
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:13,222
cartoon picture of what goes on an EPR

215
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:15,898
experiment, Chris, could you say maybe a

216
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:20,986
few words about how the

217
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:22,566
symmetry is broken between the quantum

218
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:26,118
and classical channels? I suspect it

219
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,502
might have been mentioned that these are

220
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,646
symmetrical, but yet one of the two has

221
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:31,166
to be a quantum, and the other one is a

222
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:33,840
classical channel. The quantum channel

223
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,750
mediates some sort of unitary evolution,

224
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,302
is that correct? Whereas the classical

225
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,740
channel is like an information

226
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,650
redundancy reservoir,

227
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,522
which maybe has to do something with

228
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,734
object persistence. But I'm very much

229
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:54,326
speculating at this point, so I'm not

230
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:56,150
sure if. Chris, you have any comments?

231
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,254
Yeah, well, an easy way to think about

232
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:01,834
this, I think, is to actually think

233
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:04,794
about a Bell EPR experiment. Where you

234
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:08,380
have two observers that are separated in

235
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,106
know. You have to assume here to talk

236
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:13,838
about Bell EPR, you have to assume the

237
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:17,034
Notion of Space to have a laboratory

238
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:20,286
Reference Frame. In which the

239
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:23,150
two observers are spatially separated.

240
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,906
And in that situation, then the

241
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:33,198
two observers both independently collect

242
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,300
data for some amount of time.

243
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,402
On multiple replicates of some quantum

244
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:44,114
state that's produced

245
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:46,326
by a source. So you have Pairs of

246
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,026
Photons or pairs of electrons or pairs

247
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:53,210
of whatever. And at

248
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,490
some point, the data collection Stops.

249
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,458
And at that point, the observers have to

250
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:02,330
compare their results.

251
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,614
So it's the comparison step that

252
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:09,760
requires a Classical channel.

253
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,658
And if you

254
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:16,994
think about how this happens, in

255
00:13:17,032 --> 00:13:22,914
practice, it happens via a

256
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:28,934
file sent over to the Internet. Or a

257
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:31,046
piece of paper on which the data are

258
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,526
written. That's handed by one of the

259
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:35,830
experimenters to the other experimenter.

260
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,210
Or it happens by the experimenters

261
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,602
talking to each other. So one

262
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,194
experimenter encodes a Bunch of

263
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:48,986
Information in the ambient air. And the

264
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:50,860
other experimenter hears it.

265
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,822
Or it can be Communicated by light

266
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,302
signals, right? But it's always

267
00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:00,270
Communicated by some medium.

268
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,310
And that's what Defines

269
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,902
Classical communication. It's

270
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:12,546
Communication Via a Medium that

271
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:15,774
persists through time in the observer's

272
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,010
Reference Frame.

273
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,126
And the

274
00:14:23,148 --> 00:14:26,326
Minimum time of the persistence of that

275
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:28,440
medium is given by the speed of light.

276
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,454
So if the observers are a foot apart.

277
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:34,122
And they're Communicating by a light

278
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:37,226
signal, then it may only last a

279
00:14:37,248 --> 00:14:38,330
nanosecond.

280
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,260
But if they're talking to each other,

281
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,734
it lasts several seconds. And if

282
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:50,334
they exchange a piece of paper, then

283
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:53,166
that piece of paper May last for years

284
00:14:53,348 --> 00:15:00,494
in a Lab Notebook someplace. So there's

285
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:03,010
always the Question of Persistence over

286
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,700
time.

287
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,442
That is deeply bound

288
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:14,086
up with this Notion of Classicality as

289
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:16,600
a process that takes time.

290
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,426
Information has to flow, has to be

291
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:24,666
encoded in a Medium. And then Read from

292
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:28,634
that Medium in some Finite amount of

293
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:34,766
time. And in

294
00:15:34,788 --> 00:15:36,750
a sense, we're assuming something like

295
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,870
that in the Quantum Description.

296
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,874
When we think of this boundary via

297
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:48,080
which the A and B,

298
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,470
the physical components, interact.

299
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,266
If we think of that boundary as a qubit

300
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:59,074
array, then each of those qubits persist

301
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:01,986
through time. And that's what allows

302
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:05,350
them to encode classical information.

303
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,046
So encode observational outcomes that

304
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,760
are repeated in time.

305
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,506
That's what allows them to serve as a

306
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:18,842
memory, to encode information

307
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:20,790
in a way that's thermodynamically

308
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,814
irreversible. And if

309
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,766
you think of the boundary in that way as

310
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:29,838
a qubit array, then it has a certain

311
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,520
thickness in time.

312
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,090
It's two Planck times thick.

313
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,202
The Planck time is ten to the -43

314
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:45,070
seconds, so it's unmeasurably

315
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,374
small. But the

316
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:55,254
operation of interacting with a qubit is

317
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:57,960
a physical interaction that,

318
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,254
from a relativistic point of view, has

319
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:03,080
to take this minimal time.

320
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,672
It's, in a sense, persistence for times

321
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:15,516
that are significantly longer than the

322
00:17:15,538 --> 00:17:19,164
Planck time. That is the

323
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:21,390
marker of classicality here.

324
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,030
But even these Planck time,

325
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,250
even persistence over the Planck time is

326
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,480
a necessary ingredient for talking about

327
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,764
communication, even quantum

328
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:39,760
communication.

329
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,916
So it's a very, very deep concept with

330
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,172
a very long philosophical history going

331
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:50,164
back to the ship of Theseus and all

332
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,432
that. People have been wondering about.

333
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:54,152
What does it mean to say that something

334
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,610
persists through time?

335
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,944
Does anyone want to make a comment on

336
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:05,450
that or bring in a new question?

337
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,080
Please feel free to, if you haven't

338
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,590
brought up anything yet.

339
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,196
Sure, I can speak mean, if you don't

340
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:18,796
mind. I also recall,

341
00:18:18,988 --> 00:18:22,304
and Chris, correct me if I'm wrong, we

342
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:25,024
said that, related to what you just

343
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,396
said, that clock

344
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:31,604
tick is always tantamount to one

345
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:34,980
of these classical channels.

346
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,476
Is that correct? Did I remember that

347
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:38,260
correctly.

348
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,710
Chris?

349
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,574
Yeah. An internal clock tick corresponds

350
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:01,074
to an irreversible right on the

351
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:05,142
boundary. So one can then

352
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:07,286
ask, what does it mean to say that

353
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:08,710
that's irreversible?

354
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,766
What it means is it took some energy to

355
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:17,258
do it. And if you

356
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:20,940
go back to read that bit again,

357
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,154
there's at least a reasonably high

358
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:27,482
probability that it still is in the same

359
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:30,622
state that you wrote it in. Right? And

360
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:32,734
clearly, that probability is going to

361
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:36,346
degrade through time because that action

362
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:41,122
is on the boundary. So whatever

363
00:19:41,176 --> 00:19:43,794
you've written, whatever bits that

364
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:46,834
you've written are now exposed to the

365
00:19:46,872 --> 00:19:49,026
environment. So if Alice writes them,

366
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:51,854
they're now exposed to Bob and to Bob's

367
00:19:51,902 --> 00:19:57,382
dynamics. So as

368
00:19:57,436 --> 00:20:00,486
time goes on by your internal clock or

369
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:03,414
any external clock, the probability of

370
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:06,506
that memory being the same when you go

371
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:09,178
back to read it, slowly decreases, or

372
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:12,746
maybe it decreases fast. And we

373
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:14,554
know that from our own case, our own

374
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:18,750
memories degrade through time because

375
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,446
the physical world is interacting with

376
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:22,746
our brains in ways that we don't

377
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:23,360
control,

378
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,914
killing neurons or changing their

379
00:20:30,952 --> 00:20:35,294
activity or whatever. So whenever

380
00:20:35,342 --> 00:20:38,962
we talk about memory, it's always

381
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:42,910
with this caveat that the memory is

382
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,262
exposed to the environment and it's not

383
00:20:46,316 --> 00:20:49,766
guaranteed to be the same. It's only

384
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:57,736
kind of grace

385
00:20:57,768 --> 00:20:59,432
of the environment being reasonably

386
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:02,840
benign that any of us have memories

387
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,710
at all.

388
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,224
So this thermodynamic cost to

389
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:14,000
classical information sharing or

390
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,376
writing. Would it be

391
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:20,224
fair to say that, in a sense, the price

392
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:22,630
you have to pay to protect against

393
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,124
decoherence, or entangling this

394
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,380
sector with the rest of the environment

395
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,996
just to preserve its identity? Would

396
00:21:33,018 --> 00:21:36,276
that be fair to say? Yeah, I mean,

397
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:37,976
you can think of decoherence as a good

398
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:39,476
thing, or you can think of decoherence

399
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:42,264
as a bad thing. Right. If you're trying

400
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,256
to preserve a quantum state, then it's a

401
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:47,644
bad thing. You have to spend energy to

402
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,656
prevent decoherence by cooling

403
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:53,980
everything down to Milli Kelvins.

404
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,904
But if you're interested in preserving

405
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:01,136
classical data, then decoherence is a

406
00:22:01,158 --> 00:22:04,544
good thing, because it prevents your

407
00:22:04,582 --> 00:22:07,904
classical data from being completely

408
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:10,256
rearranged by becoming entangled with

409
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:13,892
the environment. Think about

410
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:17,940
trying to write classical memories using

411
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,916
the states of atoms in the middle of the

412
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:24,710
sun, and the temperature is so high that

413
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,236
you can't do anything, you can't

414
00:22:29,268 --> 00:22:31,896
rearrange the atoms in any way and

415
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:36,440
expect them to stay put. So there

416
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,348
you're in effectively a completely

417
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:40,876
quantum environment just because of the

418
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:43,580
high temperature. So it's a plasma.

419
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,870
Yeah. And then just one final question

420
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,502
that popped to my mind, as you say this,

421
00:22:53,636 --> 00:22:55,582
and I can certainly leave it here for

422
00:22:55,636 --> 00:22:59,658
everyone else, so if we're

423
00:22:59,674 --> 00:23:04,030
trying to protect about, against random

424
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,900
loss, against the loss of information,

425
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,186
I suppose it really begs the

426
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:14,242
question of what is the source of this

427
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:17,926
noise that can perturb the

428
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:22,102
bits in the boundary? There's obviously

429
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:25,606
this distinction between thermal and

430
00:23:25,628 --> 00:23:28,358
quantum noise. Again, it's a stretch to

431
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:30,030
see if we can think back about the Wick

432
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,834
rotation, about that. But again,

433
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:36,570
I recall earlier sessions where we talk

434
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,590
how the noise here in this quantum

435
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,486
theoretic picture of information

436
00:23:41,668 --> 00:23:44,794
processing is coming from the QRFs

437
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:50,254
failing to be aligned, then you

438
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:52,910
hear about notions of quantum noise

439
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,642
versus thermal noise. Chris, do you have

440
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:58,340
any comments on all of that?

441
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,762
Yeah, I think an important thing

442
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:04,420
here,

443
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,160
let me back up.

444
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,574
The notion of noise, like so many other

445
00:24:15,612 --> 00:24:18,902
notions, is very

446
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:22,390
often treated as objective,

447
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,810
as observer independent. And so

448
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,666
when we're doing classical physics, we

449
00:24:28,688 --> 00:24:31,962
think of noise as know there's some

450
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:33,786
objective randomness in the universe,

451
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:37,582
and we call that noise. So in this

452
00:24:37,636 --> 00:24:40,894
picture, because we're working with just

453
00:24:40,932 --> 00:24:43,326
a bipartite decomposition, right, we

454
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,234
just have Alice and Bob, and that's it.

455
00:24:45,272 --> 00:24:47,010
That's the entire universe.

456
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,442
There's no external environment here to

457
00:24:53,496 --> 00:24:57,526
impose any sort of noise. But since

458
00:24:57,548 --> 00:25:01,926
we only have two systems, Alice and

459
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:05,990
Bob equals everything else, not Alice,

460
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,026
then if we talk

461
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:12,810
about Bob being a noisy environment,

462
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,582
that's clearly relative to this boundary

463
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:19,642
we've drawn between Alice and Bob. So

464
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:21,862
noise isn't observer independent.

465
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:25,274
What's noise for Alice is just Bob's

466
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:28,400
dynamics, right?

467
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,202
If you think about where these systems

468
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:38,100
come from, you've got some universe that

469
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,706
is in some pure state,

470
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:46,980
because it's an isolated system,

471
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,126
and that

472
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:54,534
state is evolving through time, which

473
00:25:54,572 --> 00:25:56,434
means it's just undergoing phase

474
00:25:56,482 --> 00:26:00,534
rotation. So there's no noise

475
00:26:00,582 --> 00:26:03,494
in that system. Right. It's perfectly

476
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:06,506
unitary, et cetera, et cetera. As soon

477
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:11,142
as you draw a boundary, then there's

478
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:13,646
information that the system on one side

479
00:26:13,668 --> 00:26:15,806
of the boundary doesn't have about the

480
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:21,374
system on the Other side. So the

481
00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:25,120
individual systems are

482
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,824
their states can now be considered

483
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:36,116
conditionally independent. I mean, you

484
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:38,164
can come up with a description in which

485
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:39,504
their states are conditionally

486
00:26:39,552 --> 00:26:43,930
independent. And that just means

487
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,000
that what the other side is doing looks

488
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,752
like noise. Unless Alice,

489
00:26:53,816 --> 00:26:58,008
say, can come up with a way of analyzing

490
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:00,620
the data that she sees on her boundary

491
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,390
in a way that makes it make sense,

492
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,112
right? And then we say it's information

493
00:27:08,246 --> 00:27:10,752
for Alice. But what does that mean? It

494
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:14,284
just means it's behavior on her boundary

495
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,624
that she's smart enough to assign some

496
00:27:16,662 --> 00:27:18,290
kind of semantics to.

497
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,004
And if she's not smart enough to do

498
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,620
that, then it's just noise.

499
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,656
So as soon as you make the notion of

500
00:27:33,678 --> 00:27:36,552
noise observer dependent, it turns into

501
00:27:36,606 --> 00:27:39,210
something that makes a lot more sense.

502
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,710
And. And just to really finish this,

503
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,508
I guess it's been a couple of months at

504
00:27:50,514 --> 00:27:52,344
least, but I think it was back in July

505
00:27:52,392 --> 00:27:55,890
that we talked about

506
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,196
the distinction between what you're

507
00:27:59,228 --> 00:28:01,248
saying, which is things having the

508
00:28:01,254 --> 00:28:04,384
appearance of noise, just because you

509
00:28:04,422 --> 00:28:06,156
have finite resources. So you cannot

510
00:28:06,188 --> 00:28:08,580
make sense of Bob's internal dynamics,

511
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,964
as opposed to in that

512
00:28:13,002 --> 00:28:15,876
cartoon of the four possibilities for

513
00:28:15,898 --> 00:28:17,812
QRFs, alignments. Right. Some of them

514
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:21,376
were thermal in the sense that one

515
00:28:21,418 --> 00:28:24,516
side was acting on a boundary qubits

516
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:26,488
while the other one was not. So then it

517
00:28:26,494 --> 00:28:29,624
truly looks like noise to the other

518
00:28:29,662 --> 00:28:33,068
side. Does that get to the bottom of the

519
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:35,016
distinction between quantum and thermal

520
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,732
noise at all, Chris, or am I

521
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:39,356
misunderstanding things here? Yeah, it

522
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:44,652
turns the distinction into essentially a

523
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:53,612
QRF. Relative languages.

524
00:28:53,676 --> 00:28:56,032
Provide a good example. Think of going

525
00:28:56,086 --> 00:28:57,840
to someplace where you don't understand

526
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,964
the language at all. Papua New guinea or

527
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:03,444
something like that. I certainly

528
00:29:03,482 --> 00:29:05,060
wouldn't understand the language.

529
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,140
That language,

530
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,644
the behavior of speaking that language

531
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:16,712
encodes lots of information for those

532
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:18,744
people and encodes no information at all

533
00:29:18,782 --> 00:29:22,312
for me. So it looks like noise to me.

534
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:25,436
I can't make sense of it, but it's not

535
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:27,230
noise from their point of view.

536
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,420
And now let's think about this

537
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,224
need to have a thermodynamic sector. If

538
00:29:36,262 --> 00:29:40,016
yOu're an organism that has to

539
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:42,256
burn energy, or any system that has to

540
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:46,530
burn energy to

541
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,020
act irreversibly on your environment,

542
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,324
that thermodynamic sector looks to you

543
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:57,872
like noise. It's just temperature,

544
00:29:58,016 --> 00:29:58,820
heat.

545
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,564
And you use that heat

546
00:30:04,692 --> 00:30:07,028
to drive your processing. And if you're

547
00:30:07,044 --> 00:30:10,104
a really good heat engine, then you can

548
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,468
use it pretty efficiently and get a lot

549
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:15,212
of bang for the buck in terms of

550
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:17,548
information processing. If you're a

551
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,710
really inefficient heat engine, then

552
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,012
maybe you have to use almost your entire

553
00:30:24,146 --> 00:30:26,816
environment as heat to do any little bit

554
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:29,010
of information processing at all.

555
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,176
So that's not a statement about the

556
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:36,044
universe as a whole. That's a statement

557
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:38,884
about you and your information

558
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:44,324
processing capabilities and your

559
00:30:44,362 --> 00:30:46,420
heat processing capabilities.

560
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,540
How good is your carnot cycle?

561
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,816
Determines the amount of information

562
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:58,072
processing you can do. Thank you,

563
00:30:58,126 --> 00:30:59,640
Chris. Ian.

564
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,552
Hi. Yeah, thank you, everyone, for

565
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:11,536
putting on this series. It's the first

566
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:13,920
time I've joined the discussion.

567
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,756
So it's a question about, in one of

568
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:24,580
the slides, there was a green rectangle,

569
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,796
and we were talking about that being,

570
00:31:27,978 --> 00:31:29,604
or Chris was talking about that being,

571
00:31:29,642 --> 00:31:32,490
a kind of thinking of that as a

572
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,504
bacterium. And it got me

573
00:31:36,702 --> 00:31:38,010
wondering whether.

574
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,636
How. Else I could get an intuitive grasp

575
00:31:41,668 --> 00:31:44,200
of this kind of spacetime emerging.

576
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,492
What I was thinking is, it appears like

577
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:52,396
to us humans, it appears like the

578
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:56,960
universe is expanding

579
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,296
through time. And I was just trying to

580
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:02,448
think a bacterium, if you placed a

581
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:06,704
single bacterium on a petri dish at

582
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:07,730
time zero,

583
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,140
or even something more simple, let's say

584
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,300
deep sea hydrothermal vent, where life

585
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,116
was supposed to, these agents were

586
00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:21,850
supposed to have maybe begun existing as

587
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,048
phospholipid type molecules. So I was

588
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:28,936
just wondering if

589
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,616
I was a phospholipid within that

590
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:34,236
bacterial membrane, just one

591
00:32:34,258 --> 00:32:37,996
single phospholipid, and all I can

592
00:32:38,018 --> 00:32:40,716
measure is the existence of

593
00:32:40,898 --> 00:32:42,604
phospholipidness, or not

594
00:32:42,642 --> 00:32:43,900
phospholipidness,

595
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,888
and selfness and not selfness. Then I

596
00:32:51,894 --> 00:32:52,976
was just trying to imagine, as this

597
00:32:52,998 --> 00:32:55,200
bacteria divides after 20 minutes,

598
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,764
let's say, the average sort of bacterial

599
00:32:56,812 --> 00:32:59,044
division time. Then before that

600
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:01,076
happeNed, all I could tell was I was

601
00:33:01,098 --> 00:33:03,828
surrounded by phospholipidness. So there

602
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:06,516
was no real distinction in my

603
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:10,752
environment. But once the

604
00:33:10,826 --> 00:33:14,548
bacteria is divided into two, then I'm

605
00:33:14,564 --> 00:33:17,096
observing some phospholipidness, which

606
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:20,490
isn't in my sort of

607
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,080
what I call my own boundary.

608
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,756
So then I've kind of created space.

609
00:33:27,858 --> 00:33:29,980
Space and time is starting to appear,

610
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,456
even though the petri dish hasn't

611
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:35,828
changed in size, or the universe hasn't

612
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:39,730
really changed, but it's the

613
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,328
phospholipids, the orientation of the

614
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:48,336
phospholipids. So, yeah, I was just

615
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:50,580
trying to liken it. If this is a scale

616
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,404
invariant principle, how can we liken it

617
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:58,740
to how other things might

618
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,960
experience space and time emerging?

619
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,504
That's where I was coming from. Am I

620
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,664
kind of totally barking up the wrong

621
00:34:04,702 --> 00:34:08,292
tree with that, or is that loose?

622
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:10,792
No, I think that's a really good

623
00:34:10,846 --> 00:34:14,460
question, and I think you're

624
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,204
constructing a very good kind of

625
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:21,896
thought experiment. And it's

626
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:24,124
this sort of question that I'm really

627
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:28,370
going to try to address in October of

628
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,844
how can we think about DFEP

629
00:34:34,892 --> 00:34:39,300
as a scale ferry theory in

630
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,772
practice, as applying at the level

631
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:45,204
of macromolecules, as you were just

632
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:49,204
describing, how do we come

633
00:34:49,242 --> 00:34:51,496
up with a description of what a

634
00:34:51,518 --> 00:34:54,120
phospholipid, say, can actually measure

635
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,610
what actually affects its state,

636
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,180
and to what extent

637
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,380
does it have a self representation?

638
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,700
My guess is that a phospholipid probably

639
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:12,472
doesn't. But a bacterium

640
00:35:12,536 --> 00:35:14,364
seems to have at least some degree of

641
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:18,896
self representation. I mean, it has an

642
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:21,600
immune system, it can feel stress.

643
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,296
So it's starting to seem like an

644
00:35:27,318 --> 00:35:29,492
organism that's not that different from

645
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:30,150
us.

646
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,884
But even something like E.

647
00:35:36,922 --> 00:35:37,780
Coli,

648
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,276
it certainly behaves in what we call

649
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:47,476
space. But it's at least not clear to me

650
00:35:47,498 --> 00:35:50,630
that it has a representation of space.

651
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,036
Although there are processes

652
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:00,600
in the E. Coli that do distinguish,

653
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,468
say, the two ends

654
00:36:04,484 --> 00:36:06,136
of the E. Coli. I mean, even if you

655
00:36:06,158 --> 00:36:09,484
think of the chemotaxis pathway, the two

656
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:12,088
ends of that pathway are quite distinct

657
00:36:12,184 --> 00:36:15,436
functionally. So perhaps E.

658
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:17,736
Coli has a one dimensional

659
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:20,032
representation of space. It can tell its

660
00:36:20,086 --> 00:36:22,770
anterior end from its posterior end,

661
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,976
but perhaps it doesn't have any

662
00:36:27,158 --> 00:36:28,944
representation of what we would call

663
00:36:28,982 --> 00:36:31,250
left and right or up and down.

664
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,064
But if you look at multicellular

665
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,140
organisms,

666
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,170
even something like, say, Hydra is

667
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,736
a spatially quite sophisticated kind of

668
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:54,276
thing. I mean, it's not bilateral, it's

669
00:36:54,308 --> 00:36:56,040
cylindrically symmetrical,

670
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,640
but it's got a very large distinction

671
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,444
between anterior and posterior. And it

672
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:07,884
seems to know quite a bit. At least I

673
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:09,324
understand, from people who work on

674
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:13,024
Hydra about its own

675
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:15,410
body, the state of its own body.

676
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,796
So I think these are exactly the same

677
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:24,196
kinds of questions that we should be

678
00:37:24,218 --> 00:37:27,536
asking, and they also apply at the scale

679
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:29,876
that's much larger than us. So if we

680
00:37:29,898 --> 00:37:33,520
think about a human society,

681
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,170
for example, as an agent,

682
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,116
what can that agent measure,

683
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:43,400
and what can that agent represent?

684
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,012
And how

685
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,830
complex can that agent's cognition be?

686
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,054
And I think

687
00:37:56,092 --> 00:37:57,650
those questions are all essentially

688
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,534
open. So,

689
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:02,678
yeah, it's a great thought experiment.

690
00:38:02,854 --> 00:38:04,586
I think it addresses exactly the

691
00:38:04,608 --> 00:38:05,882
questions that we're interested in

692
00:38:05,936 --> 00:38:09,082
addressing here. Thank you,

693
00:38:09,136 --> 00:38:11,754
Chris Harris, and then anyone else with

694
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:12,940
a raised hand.

695
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,542
Yes, thank you once again for

696
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,120
allowing me to be here with all of you.

697
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,246
Interesting, as always. So, I have a

698
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:29,090
question that is related to this notion

699
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,402
of the dual aspect of information.

700
00:38:32,536 --> 00:38:37,474
Basically that the

701
00:38:37,512 --> 00:38:39,478
meaning of formation is not just a

702
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,438
matter of interpretation, but rather it

703
00:38:42,444 --> 00:38:45,526
is rooted in the physical properties of

704
00:38:45,548 --> 00:38:48,230
the system under investigation.

705
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,850
So, basically, that, as I understand it,

706
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,842
means translates that the meaning of

707
00:38:54,896 --> 00:38:57,706
information is not separate from the

708
00:38:57,728 --> 00:39:00,570
physical properties of the system under

709
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,726
investigation, but it is rather an

710
00:39:03,748 --> 00:39:08,606
intrinsic part of it. So I

711
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:12,720
am also familiar with this

712
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,774
notion from the theory of

713
00:39:17,812 --> 00:39:20,774
computation called the Embrymersmann's

714
00:39:20,842 --> 00:39:23,646
limit. That is a limit on the maximum

715
00:39:23,678 --> 00:39:26,562
rate of computation that can be

716
00:39:26,696 --> 00:39:30,194
achieved, let's say, in a self contained

717
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:33,810
system within the material universe.

718
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:39,410
So my question is, how can we parse,

719
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,440
let's say,

720
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:48,310
that sort of computational limit

721
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,690
in terms of information processing?

722
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,080
Thank you.

723
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,952
I am not sure that

724
00:40:13,006 --> 00:40:15,130
we can talk about a.

725
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,162
I think it's very difficult to talk

726
00:40:23,216 --> 00:40:27,238
about the classical

727
00:40:27,334 --> 00:40:30,074
information processing capability of the

728
00:40:30,112 --> 00:40:31,580
universe as a whole.

729
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,018
One has to impose some sort of classical

730
00:40:39,114 --> 00:40:42,430
description, and the question is, then,

731
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,120
where does that description come from?

732
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:49,298
And from

733
00:40:49,384 --> 00:40:52,034
kind of whose point of view is that a

734
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:55,060
description? But certainly,

735
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,866
as soon as you partition the

736
00:40:58,888 --> 00:41:03,270
universe as a whole into some

737
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,080
system and some other system,

738
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:11,080
one can immediately talk about their

739
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,330
information processing capabilities.

740
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:21,290
And then the question becomes

741
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,434
quantum information processing

742
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:27,242
capabilities versus classical

743
00:41:27,306 --> 00:41:29,630
information processing capabilities.

744
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:36,526
And if

745
00:41:36,548 --> 00:41:38,194
you're looking at classical information

746
00:41:38,312 --> 00:41:42,206
processing, to the extent that it's

747
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:43,650
not reversible,

748
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,422
it requires energy. And so one

749
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:53,206
can immediately derive limits based on

750
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:55,960
the free energy access of that system.

751
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,252
If you're talking about reversible

752
00:42:02,316 --> 00:42:05,216
information processing, which purely

753
00:42:05,248 --> 00:42:08,150
quantum information processing is,

754
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,944
then you don't have that energetic

755
00:42:10,992 --> 00:42:14,132
requirement, but you also

756
00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:17,284
don't have a well defined answer in any

757
00:42:17,322 --> 00:42:18,180
classical,

758
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,552
only the. If Alice is your system

759
00:42:26,606 --> 00:42:29,236
of interest that's able to do quantum

760
00:42:29,268 --> 00:42:32,824
information processing, then it's

761
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:35,580
only her interaction partner, Bob,

762
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,190
who can use her as a quantum computer.

763
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,668
And then his ability

764
00:42:44,764 --> 00:42:48,608
to employ

765
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:52,652
Alice as a quantum computer is limited

766
00:42:52,716 --> 00:42:55,536
by his classical information processing

767
00:42:55,568 --> 00:42:57,748
capabilities because he has to define a

768
00:42:57,754 --> 00:43:00,340
classical input and a classical output.

769
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,324
So I think

770
00:43:06,362 --> 00:43:08,440
this question becomes very complicated

771
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,812
as soon as it is cast in these observer

772
00:43:13,876 --> 00:43:15,130
relative terms.

773
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,586
But such limits clearly exist, right.

774
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,874
They just require certain assumptions to

775
00:43:26,912 --> 00:43:27,980
define them.

776
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,816
So quantum information can indeed

777
00:43:34,848 --> 00:43:37,896
be understood as a kind of dual to the

778
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:39,690
classical information, right?

779
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,890
Yes.

780
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,852
And it's essentially one of these

781
00:43:51,906 --> 00:43:55,416
bulk boundary type dualities that seem

782
00:43:55,448 --> 00:43:58,716
now to be ubiquitous in physics. If we

783
00:43:58,738 --> 00:44:02,288
think of. Just think in terms of the

784
00:44:02,294 --> 00:44:03,760
holographic principle,

785
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,712
you can have quantum processing going on

786
00:44:09,846 --> 00:44:13,456
in the bulk in the system that has a

787
00:44:13,478 --> 00:44:17,476
boundary and that

788
00:44:17,498 --> 00:44:19,636
can read classical information from the

789
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:21,152
boundary and encode classical

790
00:44:21,216 --> 00:44:24,390
information on the boundary. And

791
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,556
quantitatively, the holographic

792
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:31,912
principle tells you how much, right.

793
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:34,132
What can the maximum entropy, classical

794
00:44:34,196 --> 00:44:36,010
entropy of the boundary be?

795
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,572
But what it doesn't tell you

796
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:45,630
is anything about the semantics that

797
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,676
either the system inside assigns to the

798
00:44:49,698 --> 00:44:52,368
information or any observer outside

799
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:55,856
assigns to the information. It's just a

800
00:44:55,878 --> 00:44:57,360
quantitative statement.

801
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:02,876
So in any setting that's

802
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,980
characterized by that principle,

803
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,116
the classical information on the

804
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:14,052
boundary is dual in an interesting sense

805
00:45:14,106 --> 00:45:16,164
to the quantum processing that's going

806
00:45:16,202 --> 00:45:17,850
on inside.

807
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,292
In that classical

808
00:45:24,356 --> 00:45:26,680
information on the boundary encodes

809
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,564
everything that an external observer can

810
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:32,430
know about what's going on on the.

811
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,750
Yeah, okay. Yeah,

812
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,490
Anna and then Dean after.

813
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,886
Hi. Thank you very much. I'm also

814
00:45:52,988 --> 00:45:57,094
new to your active inference and

815
00:45:57,132 --> 00:46:00,650
your course. I just want to say that

816
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,530
unfortunately, I work with humans.

817
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:10,554
And I say unfortunately because the

818
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:12,910
complexities are horrific.

819
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:21,182
So having said that, maybe my

820
00:46:21,316 --> 00:46:25,074
question will make sense. So as

821
00:46:25,112 --> 00:46:29,438
I'm learning about quantum

822
00:46:29,534 --> 00:46:33,118
information theory and what I'm

823
00:46:33,134 --> 00:46:36,854
trying to do is assess, how can this

824
00:46:36,892 --> 00:46:39,334
help me answer questions that I have in

825
00:46:39,372 --> 00:46:42,582
the systems that I work with? My

826
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:43,720
question is,

827
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:50,380
in order to have a

828
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:53,370
time arrow,

829
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,020
irreversible process,

830
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,010
don't you need to have a goal?

831
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:09,134
My question is, does it matter to

832
00:47:09,172 --> 00:47:11,310
even worry about goals?

833
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:15,410
Because as I listen to

834
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,482
all the descriptions and I think about

835
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:22,862
Alice and Bob and systems, I immediately

836
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:26,138
think about, well, so much of what we're

837
00:47:26,174 --> 00:47:28,358
talking about depends upon the goal of

838
00:47:28,364 --> 00:47:32,454
the system. And in some

839
00:47:32,652 --> 00:47:35,846
very abstract way, it seems to me

840
00:47:35,868 --> 00:47:39,898
that there is a goal that's driving the

841
00:47:40,064 --> 00:47:42,666
need for the boundary, the need for the

842
00:47:42,688 --> 00:47:43,690
communication.

843
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:50,406
And so I'm so obsessed

844
00:47:50,438 --> 00:47:53,982
with this question that I wanted to ask

845
00:47:54,036 --> 00:47:57,454
it early on before I proceed with my

846
00:47:57,492 --> 00:47:58,080
learning.

847
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,600
Yeah, that's a very good question.

848
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,930
You can think of the whole free energy

849
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:16,082
principle as a

850
00:48:16,136 --> 00:48:19,682
way of describing physical

851
00:48:19,746 --> 00:48:24,006
systems in a way that makes

852
00:48:24,108 --> 00:48:27,640
their behavior as agents obvious.

853
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:32,714
And so you could state the

854
00:48:32,752 --> 00:48:36,554
FEP by saying that every system has

855
00:48:36,592 --> 00:48:40,358
a goal, and its goal

856
00:48:40,454 --> 00:48:43,370
is minimizing prediction error.

857
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:48,910
Or to put it positively,

858
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:53,386
its goal is to predict

859
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:57,282
and therefore respond to its

860
00:48:57,336 --> 00:49:01,250
environment's actions in a way that

861
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,490
preserves its own identity.

862
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:07,106
And I don't know whether you've read

863
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:09,346
much of Carl Friston's work, but he uses

864
00:49:09,378 --> 00:49:13,014
the word self evidencing a lot. He says

865
00:49:13,052 --> 00:49:17,442
the goal of any system is to generate

866
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:20,502
evidence of its own existence, which

867
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:23,974
sounds very psychological. And Carl,

868
00:49:24,022 --> 00:49:25,260
interestingly enough,

869
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:32,186
studied first as a psychiatrist. So I

870
00:49:32,288 --> 00:49:34,102
expect that his point of view is

871
00:49:34,176 --> 00:49:36,942
actually very consonant with your

872
00:49:36,996 --> 00:49:39,120
question and where you're coming from.

873
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:46,160
Started. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

874
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:50,206
No, no. Go. I started.

875
00:49:50,388 --> 00:49:56,142
I've spent some time reading Chris

876
00:49:56,206 --> 00:50:00,040
Weisson's ideas and work on

877
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:08,262
the free energy principle and self

878
00:50:08,316 --> 00:50:11,506
evidencing. And, yes, I will continue

879
00:50:11,628 --> 00:50:15,066
to dig deep. The problem

880
00:50:15,248 --> 00:50:18,374
is. So I'm an anthropologist, and I've

881
00:50:18,422 --> 00:50:22,502
worked with Indigenous peoples

882
00:50:22,566 --> 00:50:25,406
and spent 20 years of my life living in

883
00:50:25,428 --> 00:50:27,310
these small scale societies.

884
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:34,334
One of my observations is that. And that

885
00:50:34,372 --> 00:50:36,110
I find really fascinating.

886
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,382
But. We don't have a good understanding

887
00:50:40,526 --> 00:50:44,722
of it. And that's why I decided to dig

888
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:49,570
into physics as information processing,

889
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:53,398
which is that goals are constantly being

890
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:57,510
negotiated, and it's

891
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:00,194
more along the lines. So, Michael

892
00:51:00,242 --> 00:51:03,926
Levine's work actually was what led

893
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:06,860
me to explore quantum information

894
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:08,810
theory,

895
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:14,554
which is like this collective

896
00:51:14,602 --> 00:51:18,650
intelligences that exist

897
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:22,494
within systems. And so, at each

898
00:51:22,532 --> 00:51:24,830
level of collective intelligence,

899
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:28,174
it's not just that you have a collective

900
00:51:28,222 --> 00:51:31,790
intelligence dictating a goal,

901
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,634
but that those goals are being

902
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:37,794
negotiated as

903
00:51:37,832 --> 00:51:40,102
the environments change and as

904
00:51:40,156 --> 00:51:42,242
relationships between the systems

905
00:51:42,306 --> 00:51:46,006
change. So I know these are very

906
00:51:46,108 --> 00:51:48,520
big questions, but if you could just

907
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:49,960
help me,

908
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:57,274
give me some thoughts on what

909
00:51:57,312 --> 00:51:59,386
your thoughts have been about these

910
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:00,460
kinds of questions.

911
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,406
Yeah, I think you're pointing to

912
00:52:05,428 --> 00:52:11,054
something very important here, and this

913
00:52:11,092 --> 00:52:14,766
is a

914
00:52:14,788 --> 00:52:18,610
question that this

915
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,618
kind of free energy, principle based

916
00:52:21,704 --> 00:52:26,834
work motivates immediately when

917
00:52:26,872 --> 00:52:31,982
you consider a system that comprises

918
00:52:32,046 --> 00:52:34,210
a bunch of subsystems.

919
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:40,658
I work with Michael Levin at Tufts

920
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:45,420
in developmental biology, and one of his

921
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,034
slogans is all intelligence as

922
00:52:49,072 --> 00:52:52,938
collective. And that

923
00:52:53,024 --> 00:52:56,720
immediately brings up this issue of

924
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,560
how do these components, as you put it,

925
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:05,680
negotiate their goals? How do they

926
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,786
collaborate? How do they compete? To

927
00:53:08,808 --> 00:53:11,374
what extent are they trying to deceive

928
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:13,986
each other or coerce each other or all

929
00:53:14,008 --> 00:53:17,714
of this? And we're trying

930
00:53:17,752 --> 00:53:20,470
to apply this in a cell Biology context

931
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:25,094
as a description of development and

932
00:53:25,132 --> 00:53:27,426
morphogenesis. If you think about cells

933
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,714
in a developing organism, they're

934
00:53:29,762 --> 00:53:31,670
constantly facing new environments,

935
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,582
their capabilities are constantly

936
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:37,786
changing, and how they interact with

937
00:53:37,808 --> 00:53:40,586
each other is constantly changing. And

938
00:53:40,608 --> 00:53:42,842
this all seems very psychological or

939
00:53:42,896 --> 00:53:44,170
sociological.

940
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:49,706
So I think what you're pointing

941
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:53,818
to is the ubiquitous

942
00:53:53,914 --> 00:54:00,820
need for this kind of language in

943
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:04,066
areas other than the human sciences. I

944
00:54:04,088 --> 00:54:05,806
mean, it's language that's developed

945
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:08,238
within the human sciences, but it's

946
00:54:08,254 --> 00:54:13,510
language that seems to be important at

947
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:17,874
much smaller scales. And clearly,

948
00:54:18,002 --> 00:54:19,702
one would anticipate it being important

949
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,042
in much larger scales, the scales of

950
00:54:22,096 --> 00:54:25,100
countries or civilizations or whatever.

951
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:30,634
So I guess

952
00:54:30,672 --> 00:54:32,774
my answer is yes. This is an extremely

953
00:54:32,822 --> 00:54:36,766
important point of view with

954
00:54:36,948 --> 00:54:39,854
very broad implications for how we think

955
00:54:39,892 --> 00:54:41,760
about biology, at least.

956
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,000
Thank you. Thank you.

957
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,538
Definitely looking forward to your

958
00:54:49,624 --> 00:54:52,290
continued learnings and journey.

959
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:55,250
Thank you, Dean.

960
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,166
Yeah, my question has changed three

961
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:01,782
times because just the other questions

962
00:55:01,836 --> 00:55:03,430
that have come up in the meantime.

963
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,360
So some context here.

964
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,782
Chris, you've kind of answered this.

965
00:55:11,836 --> 00:55:15,174
You mentioned dual, as in dual. And then

966
00:55:15,212 --> 00:55:17,386
Anna brought up like, is there some kind

967
00:55:17,408 --> 00:55:20,474
of competition, a dual, A-D-U-E-L going

968
00:55:20,512 --> 00:55:22,154
on? And how do we put those two things

969
00:55:22,192 --> 00:55:24,458
together? And me always thumping the

970
00:55:24,464 --> 00:55:27,594
table about minimum two. We have to keep

971
00:55:27,712 --> 00:55:30,538
at least two truisms up at once if we're

972
00:55:30,554 --> 00:55:32,206
going to gain some sense around things.

973
00:55:32,308 --> 00:55:35,086
I want to go back to that lock Loc

974
00:55:35,268 --> 00:55:36,622
slide, if we can, for a second,

975
00:55:36,676 --> 00:55:39,666
because, Chris, you mentioned your

976
00:55:39,688 --> 00:55:41,602
statement was, you draw a boundary. And

977
00:55:41,656 --> 00:55:43,362
to me, there's a lot of information

978
00:55:43,496 --> 00:55:45,380
packed in those four words.

979
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:49,526
You can draw and you can undraw, you can

980
00:55:49,548 --> 00:55:51,814
bound, you can unbound. Those are

981
00:55:51,852 --> 00:55:54,440
perfectly contextless subject matter,

982
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,030
information carrying.

983
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:02,146
Frames. But you also have in that

984
00:56:02,188 --> 00:56:05,750
packet, you and at which are imperfect

985
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:08,070
orientations, an indefinite article,

986
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,954
and all of us occupying a slide here,

987
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,506
none of us claiming to be anything other

988
00:56:12,528 --> 00:56:16,240
than a contradiction. So one

989
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:20,014
aspect of that packet, two words of it,

990
00:56:20,052 --> 00:56:22,522
literally half of it, is perfectly

991
00:56:22,586 --> 00:56:25,706
contextless and is information carrying,

992
00:56:25,738 --> 00:56:29,380
and the other, literally half of that is

993
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,346
prediction matter or information

994
00:56:31,448 --> 00:56:34,942
graphing. It's literally the byproduct

995
00:56:35,006 --> 00:56:39,026
or the spacetime construct that

996
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:42,546
is included. So I guess what I'm

997
00:56:42,578 --> 00:56:45,014
wondering is, how do we make these

998
00:56:45,052 --> 00:56:46,742
different matters, the subject matter

999
00:56:46,796 --> 00:56:48,598
and the prediction matter tango, how do

1000
00:56:48,604 --> 00:56:52,346
we get them to relate? Because in the

1001
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:55,814
session five, you went on a detour.

1002
00:56:55,862 --> 00:56:58,458
You said, we'll take a detour, which is

1003
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:01,514
it holds the exact same structure as you

1004
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:03,978
draw a boundary. So there's perfect

1005
00:57:04,064 --> 00:57:06,650
information and there's imperfect

1006
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,534
information in that they're dancing. We

1007
00:57:09,572 --> 00:57:12,382
do this all the time. This seems to me,

1008
00:57:12,436 --> 00:57:14,602
at a minimum, what information theory

1009
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:16,978
is. And that's why I want to kind of go

1010
00:57:16,984 --> 00:57:19,326
back to this slide, because this slide

1011
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:21,330
was in a much earlier session,

1012
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:24,690
but it got to session five, where the

1013
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,158
context could be recapitulated.

1014
00:57:28,334 --> 00:57:31,686
And so I'm wondering whether or not we

1015
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:34,034
can really talk about quantum

1016
00:57:34,082 --> 00:57:38,086
information without the classical, or if

1017
00:57:38,108 --> 00:57:39,480
that's even possible.

1018
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:46,614
Well, I'll go back to Boris statement.

1019
00:57:46,662 --> 00:57:48,620
In his 1928 paper,

1020
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,546
he basically said, the answer to that

1021
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:52,780
question is no.

1022
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:58,686
That we are humans. We have to

1023
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,398
communicate with each other. We have to

1024
00:58:00,404 --> 00:58:03,962
do it in language, and that's classical

1025
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:10,958
communication. And while

1026
00:58:11,044 --> 00:58:14,482
we are doing that, while we're having

1027
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:17,822
this conversation, we can't

1028
00:58:17,886 --> 00:58:21,974
be worried about the question of,

1029
00:58:22,172 --> 00:58:26,022
do I still exist or do you still

1030
00:58:26,076 --> 00:58:29,334
exist? We can worry about that question,

1031
00:58:29,452 --> 00:58:31,738
but we can't do it at the same time that

1032
00:58:31,744 --> 00:58:35,674
we're having this conversation about the

1033
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:39,494
theory of lock protocols or exchanging

1034
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:41,850
data from a Bell EPR experiment.

1035
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:46,314
And that's, of course, deeply

1036
00:58:46,362 --> 00:58:47,470
paradoxical.

1037
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:52,894
And I think that's just the situation

1038
00:58:53,012 --> 00:58:56,078
we're in. He said, none of us are

1039
00:58:56,084 --> 00:58:57,666
claiming to be anything other than a

1040
00:58:57,688 --> 00:59:01,314
contradiction. It's a Good thing that we

1041
00:59:01,512 --> 00:59:04,834
are self conscious about the fact that

1042
00:59:04,952 --> 00:59:06,574
we're doing something contradictory

1043
00:59:06,622 --> 00:59:09,540
here, or potentially contradictory here.

1044
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,826
A colleague and I wrote a paper several

1045
00:59:13,858 --> 00:59:17,522
years ago called science generates

1046
00:59:17,586 --> 00:59:19,190
limit paradoxes.

1047
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:27,126
And we basically rehearsed

1048
00:59:27,158 --> 00:59:29,466
a version of this very discussion that

1049
00:59:29,488 --> 00:59:30,780
we're having right now.

1050
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:37,934
And the upshot of that paper is that in

1051
00:59:37,972 --> 00:59:41,898
any situation in which a science

1052
00:59:42,074 --> 00:59:46,270
can turn its theoretical apparatus

1053
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:49,490
onto its own practice.

1054
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,900
So, for example,

1055
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:58,082
when physics can turn

1056
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:02,238
this analysis of boundaries

1057
01:00:02,414 --> 01:00:06,514
onto the practice of physics, then it

1058
01:00:06,552 --> 01:00:10,894
generates paradoxes. And those paradoxes

1059
01:00:11,022 --> 01:00:13,290
have a particular structure,

1060
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:18,198
which is the structure that priest,

1061
01:00:18,374 --> 01:00:21,306
I can't remember his first name, a

1062
01:00:21,328 --> 01:00:27,626
logician who works in non dialectic

1063
01:00:27,658 --> 01:00:30,270
logic, calls a limit paradox.

1064
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:34,750
And all of this is coupled to

1065
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:37,182
Gertle's theorem. And these other

1066
01:00:37,236 --> 01:00:42,026
paradoxes of self reference are aspects

1067
01:00:42,058 --> 01:00:43,330
of self reference.

1068
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:48,226
But I think this situation really is

1069
01:00:48,248 --> 01:00:55,446
ubiquitous and inescapable. That as

1070
01:00:55,468 --> 01:00:57,606
soon as we apply the tools of science to

1071
01:00:57,628 --> 01:00:59,110
the practice of science,

1072
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:03,578
we generate these

1073
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:07,514
paradoxical situations in which we have

1074
01:01:07,552 --> 01:01:11,066
to acknowledge that we are entities of

1075
01:01:11,088 --> 01:01:12,300
a certain sort,

1076
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:18,320
and that we are

1077
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:25,710
constructing our theories using

1078
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:29,250
a faculty of imagination

1079
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:34,482
that lets us act as if we don't have a

1080
01:01:34,616 --> 01:01:35,700
point of view.

1081
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:41,426
So it lets us act as if what we're

1082
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:42,902
talking about is point of view,

1083
01:01:42,956 --> 01:01:47,350
independent. But our

1084
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:50,294
theories themselves tell us that we have

1085
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:51,566
points of view and that they're

1086
01:01:51,618 --> 01:01:54,650
important. So we're stuck in this

1087
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,226
paradoxical situation. I don't know

1088
01:01:57,248 --> 01:01:58,538
whether that's what you're trying to

1089
01:01:58,544 --> 01:02:02,460
point to here, but it's what

1090
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:07,326
I immediately leaped to hearing what

1091
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,160
you said.

1092
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:22,264
Yeah, a lot there. Anyone else want to

1093
01:02:22,302 --> 01:02:23,610
add a piece?

1094
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:32,504
Yeah, I'm going to have to go. So thank

1095
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:34,476
you, Chris. We'll stay for a few

1096
01:02:34,498 --> 01:02:35,884
minutes. Thank you, though. This was

1097
01:02:35,922 --> 01:02:37,468
awesome. We're really looking forward to

1098
01:02:37,474 --> 01:02:41,196
lecture six. Okay, thank you

1099
01:02:41,218 --> 01:02:42,664
all, and thank you all for attending

1100
01:02:42,712 --> 01:02:44,704
this discussion session. It's. It's nice

1101
01:02:44,742 --> 01:02:49,184
to have this kind of real

1102
01:02:49,222 --> 01:02:51,072
time discussion which is missing during

1103
01:02:51,126 --> 01:02:53,984
the actual lecture sessions. So I

1104
01:02:54,022 --> 01:02:56,884
appreciate it. Thanks again. SEe you.

1105
01:02:56,922 --> 01:02:58,980
Thank you. Thank you, Chris.

1106
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,964
Thank you, Kate. Do you want to ask

1107
01:03:05,002 --> 01:03:07,380
anything, or. Anyone can just bring up

1108
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:09,210
anything they're thinking right now.

1109
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,952
Nothing in particular. I'm just really

1110
01:03:13,006 --> 01:03:16,456
looking forward to the last lecture on

1111
01:03:16,478 --> 01:03:18,090
the biology of it all.

1112
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,510
Great.

1113
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,748
Well, any other thoughts or questions,

1114
01:03:28,834 --> 01:03:31,308
or if anyone in the live chat has a

1115
01:03:31,314 --> 01:03:32,956
thought or a question, they can write it

1116
01:03:32,978 --> 01:03:35,250
and we'll read it in the coming minutes.

1117
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,480
Well, I just wanted to thank you for

1118
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,840
creating the space. It's been

1119
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:48,516
absolutely amazing that

1120
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:53,812
I was able to find this situation

1121
01:03:53,946 --> 01:03:58,112
where people are talking about enormous

1122
01:03:58,176 --> 01:04:01,850
questions and very difficult questions.

1123
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:12,520
I just thought I'd share that I find

1124
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:13,960
in academia.

1125
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,884
I don't know why we're not having these

1126
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:23,230
conversations. And I've been.

1127
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,320
It's been like a ten year journey,

1128
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,970
and I have finally found this group.

1129
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,160
I just wanted to express my gratitude.

1130
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,764
Thank you. I'll read a question from

1131
01:04:39,802 --> 01:04:41,892
the live chat and anyone can give their

1132
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:45,172
thoughts. So, Mills 81 two

1133
01:04:45,226 --> 01:04:49,044
wrote, it seems that concilience would

1134
01:04:49,082 --> 01:04:51,664
aim to ameliorate the problems of self

1135
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:53,976
reference. Is this a category of

1136
01:04:53,998 --> 01:04:56,760
solution that seems valuable or fraught?

1137
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,238
Could concilience ameliorate the

1138
01:05:03,244 --> 01:05:04,870
problems of self reference?

1139
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:13,682
Yes, Dean, can I just ask a. Different

1140
01:05:13,736 --> 01:05:15,940
question built on that? Which is,

1141
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:20,258
what if the contradiction is a feature

1142
01:05:20,434 --> 01:05:22,470
as opposed to a fraughtness?

1143
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,144
Do I contradict myself? Very well,

1144
01:05:30,182 --> 01:05:31,888
then. I contain multitudes. There's the

1145
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:35,344
Whitman angle, then there's the William

1146
01:05:35,392 --> 01:05:38,724
Blake. Life is a fiction and is made up

1147
01:05:38,762 --> 01:05:42,870
of contradiction. So what is the problem

1148
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,820
of self reference?

1149
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:52,310
Whose problem is it? Harris?

1150
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:56,086
Yeah, I will try to answer a bit, to

1151
01:05:56,108 --> 01:05:59,350
tackle a bit both questions by

1152
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:03,702
offering my views from the cognitive

1153
01:06:03,766 --> 01:06:06,810
science perspective. Basically,

1154
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,610
I think it has to do with consilience,

1155
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:12,694
has to do with the numerous cognitive

1156
01:06:12,742 --> 01:06:15,760
bias that we all are,

1157
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:19,614
let's say, subjected to.

1158
01:06:19,732 --> 01:06:22,014
So there is a very long list of

1159
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:25,134
cognitive biases, and there are more

1160
01:06:25,172 --> 01:06:30,866
than 100 listed, I think. So this

1161
01:06:30,888 --> 01:06:34,498
is one of the challenges in terms of

1162
01:06:34,664 --> 01:06:38,002
achieving, let's say, good levels of

1163
01:06:38,056 --> 01:06:42,178
consilience across various domains.

1164
01:06:42,354 --> 01:06:45,400
So this is what I wanted to add.

1165
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,320
Another thought on. That is consilience,

1166
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,230
though it can mean many things,

1167
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,644
synthesis. Sorry,

1168
01:06:58,842 --> 01:07:00,410
yeah, please, Donna, go ahead.

1169
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:06,570
I don't really have

1170
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,844
insights into the

1171
01:07:10,882 --> 01:07:13,116
self referencing problem. I need to do a

1172
01:07:13,138 --> 01:07:14,910
lot of thinking about that.

1173
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:21,328
But coming from training

1174
01:07:21,414 --> 01:07:25,970
in evolutionary biology and

1175
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:30,284
spending graduate school, postgraduate

1176
01:07:30,332 --> 01:07:34,390
school, working on explanations where

1177
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:40,368
we thought of many hypotheses,

1178
01:07:40,464 --> 01:07:42,500
models, et cetera,

1179
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,804
based on a goal, which is organisms

1180
01:07:46,852 --> 01:07:49,316
are designed to maximize their fitness.

1181
01:07:49,508 --> 01:07:52,168
And, of course, we know that there are

1182
01:07:52,174 --> 01:07:55,476
lots of problems with that. And it turns

1183
01:07:55,508 --> 01:07:58,076
out, with our data, what we found is

1184
01:07:58,098 --> 01:08:02,072
that was not the case in the populations

1185
01:08:02,136 --> 01:08:04,684
that we're working with. Too often, the

1186
01:08:04,722 --> 01:08:07,180
goal did not seem to be fitness.

1187
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:13,488
But what that experience gave me

1188
01:08:13,654 --> 01:08:16,208
is that there was something we could

1189
01:08:16,294 --> 01:08:21,200
hang on to in order to allow

1190
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:24,740
ourselves to propose models for why

1191
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:26,836
humans behave the way they do and the

1192
01:08:26,858 --> 01:08:28,470
decisions that they make.

1193
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,860
So that's why I go back to goals,

1194
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:39,192
because if

1195
01:08:39,326 --> 01:08:41,204
at whatever level of collective

1196
01:08:41,252 --> 01:08:42,984
intelligence we're talking about, there

1197
01:08:43,022 --> 01:08:47,204
is a. And Harris,

1198
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:49,756
please let me know if this would be

1199
01:08:49,778 --> 01:08:52,376
correct, that even cognitive biases

1200
01:08:52,568 --> 01:08:56,396
exist. They exist because there is some

1201
01:08:56,498 --> 01:08:58,492
goal, and therefore we can talk about

1202
01:08:58,546 --> 01:09:01,890
cognitive biases with respect to some

1203
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,360
goal.

1204
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:10,640
Yes. There is some sort of telenomy in

1205
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:14,256
conscious agents, or personal systems,

1206
01:09:14,288 --> 01:09:17,668
as I call them, and it has to

1207
01:09:17,674 --> 01:09:21,872
do with goals. Yes, and cognitive

1208
01:09:21,936 --> 01:09:25,816
biases and the limitations on

1209
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:28,564
the knowledge. Let's say, maybe it's

1210
01:09:28,612 --> 01:09:31,284
limitations on parts of the knowledge

1211
01:09:31,332 --> 01:09:34,344
representation that each of us has.

1212
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:37,996
Maybe there are limitations in terms of

1213
01:09:38,178 --> 01:09:42,440
access to knowing, and there are various

1214
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,556
forms of knowing, so it depends on

1215
01:09:46,578 --> 01:09:49,816
many things. And, for example,

1216
01:09:49,938 --> 01:09:52,972
one of the cognitive bias

1217
01:09:53,036 --> 01:09:56,412
that I believe can have a negative

1218
01:09:56,476 --> 01:09:59,810
impact on consilience, let's say,

1219
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:06,020
in addressing this self referentiality

1220
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,230
will be the Halo effect.

1221
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:15,312
So where you seem to prioritize,

1222
01:10:15,376 --> 01:10:18,250
let's say, or give some advantage to

1223
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,988
some types of individuals,

1224
01:10:22,164 --> 01:10:26,600
ideas, or even theories because

1225
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:29,676
of that, hell, for whatever reason that

1226
01:10:29,698 --> 01:10:32,972
is, it is based on maybe on

1227
01:10:33,026 --> 01:10:35,004
many different things, maybe on your

1228
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:37,710
past history or other.

1229
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:43,170
Yeah. Thank you,

1230
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,992
Anna. And if I may add something rather

1231
01:10:47,046 --> 01:10:49,650
briefly. Your question reminded me of

1232
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:52,544
Levin's, and I think it was written with

1233
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:55,716
Phil. The proposal about reduction of

1234
01:10:55,738 --> 01:10:59,140
stress as a goal that guides the

1235
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:01,524
emergence of collective structures is

1236
01:11:01,562 --> 01:11:05,204
one of the papers formulated that seems

1237
01:11:05,242 --> 01:11:08,264
to be the goal that drives things as

1238
01:11:08,302 --> 01:11:10,888
they grow in complexity. Reduction of

1239
01:11:10,974 --> 01:11:12,996
collective stress or reduction of stress

1240
01:11:13,028 --> 01:11:15,976
at any level. Yeah, I don't remember the

1241
01:11:15,998 --> 01:11:17,784
title of the paper, but that was the

1242
01:11:17,822 --> 01:11:19,484
gist of it, if I understood it

1243
01:11:19,522 --> 01:11:22,828
correctly. Thank you.

1244
01:11:22,914 --> 01:11:27,468
I'll look that up. Great. Another piece

1245
01:11:27,634 --> 01:11:29,636
of the Levinson Fields collaboration

1246
01:11:29,688 --> 01:11:32,176
that Chris alluded to earlier is that

1247
01:11:32,278 --> 01:11:35,724
the notion of computation is observer

1248
01:11:35,772 --> 01:11:38,256
dependent. That's polycomputation. If

1249
01:11:38,278 --> 01:11:40,800
there was a fully encrypted computation,

1250
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:44,164
an observer without the key would only

1251
01:11:44,202 --> 01:11:48,100
be seeing noise to them. Whereas if they

1252
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,084
were to have the decryption key, then

1253
01:11:50,122 --> 01:11:52,036
they could fully understand and go into

1254
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,704
more detail about the computation. So

1255
01:11:54,762 --> 01:11:58,468
then let's say that we're in relation

1256
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:01,752
or observing or investigating some life

1257
01:12:01,886 --> 01:12:04,868
phenomena at some scale, but we're

1258
01:12:04,884 --> 01:12:06,488
speaking in the scale free setting, but

1259
01:12:06,494 --> 01:12:09,470
we're observing a thing that's there.

1260
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,532
People have ascribed different goals to

1261
01:12:15,586 --> 01:12:19,096
describe what we call goal oriented

1262
01:12:19,128 --> 01:12:21,424
behavior, like seemingly to survive or

1263
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:24,076
seemingly to have evolutionary fitness.

1264
01:12:24,268 --> 01:12:28,204
However, one, an observer

1265
01:12:28,252 --> 01:12:30,764
could also project different proximate

1266
01:12:30,812 --> 01:12:33,616
goals. Like the goal to minimize stress,

1267
01:12:33,728 --> 01:12:36,036
the goal to minimize free energy, the

1268
01:12:36,058 --> 01:12:38,580
goal to minimize surprise. Those

1269
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:42,052
proximate observer proposed goals as if

1270
01:12:42,106 --> 01:12:46,468
goals may be exactly isomorphic

1271
01:12:46,564 --> 01:12:49,000
or aligned with fitness maximization.

1272
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:51,764
So that could just be multiple

1273
01:12:51,812 --> 01:12:54,836
perspectives of projective goals.

1274
01:12:55,028 --> 01:12:57,880
And whatever the observer projects,

1275
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,060
that doesn't mean it describes

1276
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:07,084
the actual process of the

1277
01:13:07,122 --> 01:13:10,444
phenomena at all. There's just nothing.

1278
01:13:10,562 --> 01:13:13,804
Alice can make any story about Bob.

1279
01:13:13,932 --> 01:13:16,736
And it may or may not have anything to

1280
01:13:16,758 --> 01:13:19,728
do or even be possible to be of the kind

1281
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:23,904
that Bob tells about is.

1282
01:13:24,022 --> 01:13:25,316
I want to just piggyback on that.

1283
01:13:25,338 --> 01:13:27,716
Daniel, this is really hugely important.

1284
01:13:27,898 --> 01:13:30,676
The moment you use the word goals or the

1285
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:33,812
moment you use the word fitness, you are

1286
01:13:33,946 --> 01:13:37,496
assuming context. Whereas a

1287
01:13:37,518 --> 01:13:39,336
lot of this stuff that's happening on

1288
01:13:39,358 --> 01:13:41,848
this holographic screen is completely

1289
01:13:41,934 --> 01:13:45,032
abstractless, abstracted and completely

1290
01:13:45,166 --> 01:13:48,764
context less. There's no

1291
01:13:48,802 --> 01:13:52,408
context required. So if you're

1292
01:13:52,424 --> 01:13:54,716
going to focus on that part of it, as

1293
01:13:54,738 --> 01:13:57,004
long as you can juggle both at the same

1294
01:13:57,042 --> 01:14:00,364
time and keep the two things apart,

1295
01:14:00,412 --> 01:14:02,844
because one does not require context,

1296
01:14:02,972 --> 01:14:05,680
the other completely assumes that

1297
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:08,320
context is given. And now you're taking

1298
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:11,136
that into your calculus. Right? But

1299
01:14:11,158 --> 01:14:14,196
they're not the same. I'm just. I want

1300
01:14:14,218 --> 01:14:16,470
to reinforce what Daniel just said.

1301
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,140
Thank you, Dean Ian.

1302
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,304
Then continue. Thank you.

1303
01:14:27,342 --> 01:14:30,136
Yeah, I was just maybe reinforcing what

1304
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:33,064
you were saying or reflecting on it.

1305
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:36,056
I was thinking about the behaviors we

1306
01:14:36,078 --> 01:14:39,320
see in other animals and even ourselves

1307
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,916
that we might not think are related to

1308
01:14:41,938 --> 01:14:44,760
fitness. Like, I don't know, there's

1309
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,896
those kind of gazelle type creatures

1310
01:14:47,928 --> 01:14:50,864
that just jump into the air, but they

1311
01:14:50,902 --> 01:14:53,264
seem to do that at a time which might

1312
01:14:53,302 --> 01:14:57,170
make them be predated upon by

1313
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:02,784
some tiger or lion, which then

1314
01:15:02,822 --> 01:15:05,356
all the sort of biologists try and

1315
01:15:05,398 --> 01:15:07,124
figure out how is this related to

1316
01:15:07,162 --> 01:15:10,356
fitness? And we may do the same. If I go

1317
01:15:10,378 --> 01:15:13,248
and mow my lawn, waste half a Sunday

1318
01:15:13,264 --> 01:15:14,756
afternoon, mowing my lawn. What's that

1319
01:15:14,778 --> 01:15:16,216
got to do with my fitness? Well,

1320
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:17,368
actually, it's to do with keeping up

1321
01:15:17,374 --> 01:15:21,588
with the Joneses and my social status.

1322
01:15:21,764 --> 01:15:24,552
So it's really hard to actually know

1323
01:15:24,606 --> 01:15:27,956
what my behavior is about. I can create

1324
01:15:27,998 --> 01:15:30,670
a story to say that it's to do with

1325
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,372
minimizing free energy or fitness, but

1326
01:15:35,426 --> 01:15:37,676
really, is it or not? I don't know. Is

1327
01:15:37,698 --> 01:15:40,976
that kind of what you were getting at or

1328
01:15:40,998 --> 01:15:44,320
something different? Yeah, it's a great

1329
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:47,180
point. And also, it's come up several

1330
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:50,624
times about goals. The term goal is not

1331
01:15:50,662 --> 01:15:53,084
to be found within the active inference

1332
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:55,844
ontology. Strictly speaking, that's why

1333
01:15:55,882 --> 01:15:57,892
we have so much fun with what we expect

1334
01:15:57,946 --> 01:16:00,196
and what we prefer. How can it be what

1335
01:16:00,218 --> 01:16:03,236
we expect and be the positive thing that

1336
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:05,476
we pursue? Well, that's how paths of

1337
01:16:05,498 --> 01:16:08,404
least action work. And then if somebody

1338
01:16:08,442 --> 01:16:10,212
else wants to look at that path of least

1339
01:16:10,266 --> 01:16:11,796
action and say, well, here was a mile

1340
01:16:11,828 --> 01:16:13,496
point, and this is where it looked like

1341
01:16:13,518 --> 01:16:14,936
they were heading north, and this is

1342
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:16,344
where it looked like the goal was to

1343
01:16:16,382 --> 01:16:19,820
evade this. Those are all stories that

1344
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:22,444
an observer could tell about a path, or

1345
01:16:22,482 --> 01:16:24,444
that the path might tell itself about

1346
01:16:24,482 --> 01:16:28,700
its own path. But those goal

1347
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,724
narratives don't need to be implemented

1348
01:16:33,852 --> 01:16:37,388
proximally or primally with goals.

1349
01:16:37,484 --> 01:16:41,484
As a kind of core player

1350
01:16:41,532 --> 01:16:44,416
in the active inference ontology, I'll

1351
01:16:44,448 --> 01:16:46,116
read some of these great comments and

1352
01:16:46,138 --> 01:16:47,764
questions. Just if anybody has a thought

1353
01:16:47,802 --> 01:16:50,244
on them from the live chat, just feel

1354
01:16:50,282 --> 01:16:53,620
free. John Reed wrote,

1355
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,008
what does the active inference group? I

1356
01:16:56,014 --> 01:16:59,130
think that's us, but includes everyone.

1357
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,084
Think about the equation of pilot wave.

1358
01:17:02,212 --> 01:17:04,404
With many worlds recently expounded upon

1359
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:07,356
by Chris O'Dowd at PBS. I found it to be

1360
01:17:07,378 --> 01:17:09,660
mixing terms and frustrating personally,

1361
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,372
any thoughts on pilot wave and many

1362
01:17:13,426 --> 01:17:16,984
worlds? And I would also just be curious

1363
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:20,368
on the physics or technical side, where

1364
01:17:20,454 --> 01:17:23,840
does what Chris is sharing

1365
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:26,764
connect to these kinds of discussions

1366
01:17:26,812 --> 01:17:31,472
that people have about many worlds and

1367
01:17:31,526 --> 01:17:33,700
different interpretations of quantum?

1368
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:40,256
Yeah, that's a great question. So I

1369
01:17:40,278 --> 01:17:43,584
don't know that I can answer it. I know

1370
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:46,708
that when it comes to interpretations of

1371
01:17:46,714 --> 01:17:47,860
quantum mechanics,

1372
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:54,496
whether the collapse or the many worlds

1373
01:17:54,528 --> 01:17:57,168
or whatever, I think what they're

1374
01:17:57,184 --> 01:17:59,992
hinting at, and Chris would probably

1375
01:18:00,046 --> 01:18:02,004
answer something along those lines,

1376
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:05,604
that quantum theory is fundamentally

1377
01:18:05,652 --> 01:18:10,120
about information. And until

1378
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:13,480
we make sense of that fully

1379
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,420
and fully spell out all the details,

1380
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:21,164
I think these philosophical issues or

1381
01:18:21,202 --> 01:18:22,856
the interpretations of quantum mechanics

1382
01:18:22,888 --> 01:18:25,264
are going to linger. I don't have any

1383
01:18:25,302 --> 01:18:29,356
strong thoughts on interpretations,

1384
01:18:29,548 --> 01:18:33,404
and I would say I'm an agnostic

1385
01:18:33,532 --> 01:18:35,228
about interpretations of quantum

1386
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:37,744
mechanics. I don't know that I subscribe

1387
01:18:37,792 --> 01:18:41,492
to any of and

1388
01:18:41,546 --> 01:18:43,956
especially pilot wave. I don't have the

1389
01:18:43,978 --> 01:18:47,876
slightest idea about it. Cool.

1390
01:18:48,058 --> 01:18:51,240
Harris? Yes. If you allow me, I have a

1391
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,724
small story regarding pilot wave.

1392
01:18:54,852 --> 01:18:58,760
I was conversing with Chat GPT

1393
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:02,812
and I actually asked what it thought

1394
01:19:02,866 --> 01:19:06,684
about Pilot wave after watching a

1395
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:09,144
lecture on it and then I got intrigued

1396
01:19:09,192 --> 01:19:12,460
and I wanted to ask and this actually

1397
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:16,156
happened. The model started replying and

1398
01:19:16,178 --> 01:19:18,256
I got the chance to read a bit the

1399
01:19:18,278 --> 01:19:21,056
reply. And the reply was like, it is

1400
01:19:21,078 --> 01:19:24,144
very interesting, but most probably is

1401
01:19:24,182 --> 01:19:27,828
not correct, it is wrong. And then it

1402
01:19:27,914 --> 01:19:30,532
must have reached some sort of

1403
01:19:30,586 --> 01:19:34,196
information goal. It retracted the

1404
01:19:34,218 --> 01:19:36,996
reply and it replied to me. Can you ask

1405
01:19:37,018 --> 01:19:41,844
me a different question? So this

1406
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:44,256
is my short experience with pilot wave

1407
01:19:44,288 --> 01:19:47,716
theory. Can I ask a question? Is a pilot

1408
01:19:47,748 --> 01:19:50,520
wave more or less than 100ft in height?

1409
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,350
I think it's exactly 100.

1410
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,550
Any other thoughts or questions?

1411
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,612
It's a fun and lively live chat too,

1412
01:20:07,666 --> 01:20:10,270
which is always fun.

1413
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:19,200
Yeah, well, we are it

1414
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:24,078
coming right along in the year and

1415
01:20:24,164 --> 01:20:28,560
now five, six completed with

1416
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:34,242
this course. So any

1417
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:36,626
comments that anyone here just wants to

1418
01:20:36,728 --> 01:20:39,474
make in a closing round? Anybody who

1419
01:20:39,512 --> 01:20:41,220
wants to can go for it.

1420
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:46,534
Yeah, I have a question. If questions

1421
01:20:46,652 --> 01:20:50,134
come up, have come up during the

1422
01:20:50,172 --> 01:20:50,870
session.

1423
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:56,714
Yes. Who could I send

1424
01:20:56,752 --> 01:21:00,140
them to and how? Great question.

1425
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:04,346
In the video description, you can get to

1426
01:21:04,368 --> 01:21:06,138
the syllabus of the course and one of

1427
01:21:06,144 --> 01:21:08,910
the pages on the course website. Course

1428
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:11,422
syllabus is a question and answer form.

1429
01:21:11,556 --> 01:21:13,822
So you'll see several dozen questions

1430
01:21:13,876 --> 01:21:15,326
that people have already written and

1431
01:21:15,348 --> 01:21:18,506
Chris gives answers and then it's

1432
01:21:18,538 --> 01:21:22,318
publicly posted. All of the lectures,

1433
01:21:22,414 --> 01:21:24,574
discussions and questions and answers

1434
01:21:24,622 --> 01:21:27,650
will be published after the course. So

1435
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:31,266
every question, no matter from where or

1436
01:21:31,368 --> 01:21:34,054
where to all of these questions are

1437
01:21:34,092 --> 01:21:37,186
encouraged. It only makes it a richer

1438
01:21:37,218 --> 01:21:40,374
and more relevant publication. Thank

1439
01:21:40,412 --> 01:21:41,000
you.

1440
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:48,170
Okay, Ian Harris or Dean?

1441
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:54,906
Yes. Susan also says post in discord.

1442
01:21:55,018 --> 01:21:55,920
Great point.

1443
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:01,426
Yeah, I just wanted to add a small point

1444
01:22:01,608 --> 01:22:04,786
as a conclusion. From my personal

1445
01:22:04,888 --> 01:22:09,154
perspective, I really find that the

1446
01:22:09,192 --> 01:22:12,420
ideas of Chris Fields, they can be

1447
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:17,158
revolutionary, let's say in a variety of

1448
01:22:17,324 --> 01:22:20,642
different fields.

1449
01:22:20,786 --> 01:22:25,510
And I can see it in quantum cryptography

1450
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:29,674
and also about what I've mentioned

1451
01:22:29,872 --> 01:22:33,142
before in terms of quantum knowledge

1452
01:22:33,206 --> 01:22:35,546
representation. So these are the two

1453
01:22:35,568 --> 01:22:38,822
fields that I can clearly see it.

1454
01:22:38,896 --> 01:22:43,194
So it is great to be able to participate

1455
01:22:43,242 --> 01:22:45,774
in this conversation. So once again,

1456
01:22:45,812 --> 01:22:49,630
thanks to everyone. Great to

1457
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:52,002
participate in this conversation or

1458
01:22:52,056 --> 01:22:54,350
quantum knowledge representation,

1459
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:55,890
whichever you prefer.

1460
01:22:58,070 --> 01:23:00,450
Ander, any last comments?

1461
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:05,858
Not really. Just looking forward to the

1462
01:23:05,864 --> 01:23:07,140
next one. I guess.

1463
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:12,786
I should say. And what next year? This

1464
01:23:12,808 --> 01:23:15,700
is going to be an ongoing thing. Yes,

1465
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:17,674
we'll. We'll come back stronger next

1466
01:23:17,712 --> 01:23:18,780
