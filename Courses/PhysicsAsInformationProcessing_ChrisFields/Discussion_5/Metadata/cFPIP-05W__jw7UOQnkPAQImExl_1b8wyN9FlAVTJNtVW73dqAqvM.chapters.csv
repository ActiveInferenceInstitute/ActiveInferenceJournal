3150	45418	00:03	Information processing discussion five should be a fun discussion on a great fifth lecture. Andre, if you'd like to give some opening remarks, and then also anyone else, whether it's your first time joining a discussion or not.	Information processing discussion five is scheduled for September 30, 2023	Physicysics 5, Introduction
45594	191774	00:45	Some features of biology should remain invariant at different scales. Chris himself made a few remarks on how the renormalization group flow may be trivial in biology. I would like Chris to explain a little more precisely what these diagrams mean.	Scale free theories are theories where there is no preferred scale of energy or distance	Free Energy and Scale Free theories
191972	623100	03:11	Time is actually more fundamental than space, that one has to have time to be able to see space. For space, we need object persistence, which is the defining feature of classicality. Quantum Darwinism already assumes object persistence. How does that relationship compare with other accounts coming from QdaR and decoherence?	Quantum Darwinism already assumes object persistence, and it also assumes classical communication	Quantum Darwinism and object persistence
624190	1070644	10:24	The quantum channel mediates some sort of unitary evolution. Whereas the classical channel is like an information redundancy reservoir. The Question of Persistence over time is deeply bound up with this Notion of Classicality as a process that takes time.	Chris: Object persistence is the defining feature of classical communication	Quantum Communication and the Classical Channel
1070762	1855530	17:50	An internal clock tick corresponds to an irreversible right on the boundary. Whatever bits that you've written are now exposed to the environment. Would it be fair to say that the price you have to pay to protect against decoherence is entangling this sector with the rest of the environment just to preserve its identity?	People have been wondering about whether something persists through time	Quantum information storage and decoherence
1857500	2303614	30:57	Chris Harris: How can we liken DFEP to how other things might experience space and time emerging? Ian: A bacterium seems to have at least some degree of self representation. How can DFEP be applied at the level of macromolecules?	Ian Harris: I was wondering whether bacterium has a representation of space	Do bacterians have a self-representation?
2303812	3295250	38:23	 quantum information can indeed be understood as a kind of dual to the classical information, right? So as I'm learning about quantum information theory, how can this help me answer questions that I have in the systems that I work with? Does it matter to even worry about goals?	Carl Friston: Question is about quantum information processing versus classical information processing	Quantum information processing capabilities vs classical information processing
3297430	3332206	54:57	Yeah, my question has changed three times because just the other questions that have come up in the meantime. We have to keep at least two truisms up at once if we're going to gain some sense around things.	My question has changed three times because just the other questions have come up	Sen. Chris Collins on the Middle East
3332308	3798090	55:32	Chris SEe asks whether we can really talk about quantum information without the classical, or if that's even possible. A colleague and I wrote a paper called science generates limit paradoxes. As soon as we apply the tools of science to the practice of science, we generate these paradoxical situations.	Chris: Science generates paradoxes when it applies theoretical tools to practice	Quantum information and the limit paradox
3801760	3882660	1:03:21	Great. Well, any other thoughts or questions, or if anyone in the live chat has a thought or a question, they can write it and we'll read it in the coming minutes. It's been absolutely amazing that I was able to find this situation. I just wanted to express my gratitude.	I just wanted to thank you for creating this space for open discussion	A Question for the Future of Science
3883320	4123850	1:04:43	Dean Ornish: Could concilience ameliorate the problems of self reference? He says it has to do with consilience, with the numerous cognitive biases. Ornish offers his views from the cognitive science perspective.	Dean Harris: Could concilience ameliorate problems of self reference	Concilience and the Problem of Self Reference
4125820	4544624	1:08:45	There is some sort of telenomy in conscious agents, or personal systems, and it has to do with goals. And cognitive biases and the limitations on the knowledge. Daniel: When you use the word goals or the word fitness, you are assuming context. But a lot of this stuff is completely abstractless.	Even cognitive biases exist because there is some goal, Harris says	Cognitive biases and the law of evolutionary fitness
4544662	4810270	1:15:44	With many worlds recently expounded upon by Chris O'Dowd at PBS. Any thoughts on pilot wave and many worlds? And also just be curious on the physics or technical side. It's a fun and lively live chat too, which is always fun.	With many worlds recently expounded upon by Chris O'Dowd	Pilot Wave and the Many Worlds
4815690	4975890	1:20:15	All of the lectures, discussions and questions and answers will be published after the course. Every question, no matter from where or where to all of these questions are encouraged. Great to participate in this conversation or quantum knowledge representation, whichever you prefer.	Any comments that anyone here just wants to make in a closing round	Q&A
4978070	5011830	1:22:58	Ander, any last comments? Not really. Just looking forward to the next one. And what next year? This is going to be an ongoing thing. We'll come back stronger next year, for sure. Thank you all. See you next time.	Ander, any last comments? Not really. Just looking forward to the next one. And what next year	Ander Pandey
