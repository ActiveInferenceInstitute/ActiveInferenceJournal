00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,460
Hello and welcome, everyone, to the Active Inference Institute.

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:16,020
This is Session 1 of the course "Physics as Information Processing" with Chris Fields.

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,316
First we'll have Ander Aguirre and Chris Fields

4
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:20,232
introduce themselves.

5
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:23,540
And then we'll carry on with the first lecture,

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,152
here.

7
00:00:24,286 --> 00:00:44,084
Check out the video description for a link to the [Course Overview website](https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/fields-physics-2023), where you can ask questions that will be answered asynchronously; register to participate in the discussions, which happen about two weeks after each of the six lecture sessions; and just learn more about this area.

8
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:49,264
So thank you both so much for joining into this adventure

9
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:51,140
we are starting now.

10
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,328
And first, please, Ander Aguirre, introduce yourself.

11
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:57,172
And then Chris' introduction and lecture.

12
00:00:57,236 --> 00:00:58,010
Thank you.

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,280
Hello!

14
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,200
So I'll be the course assistant.

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,270
And I'm a postdoc in math, specializing in probability. And I have a deep interest in the physics of information.

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,140
And I've been familiar with Chris's papers for a while.

17
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,190
So, yeah, just here to learn myself!

18
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,316
Thank you, Ander.

19
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:21,840
And thank you, Daniel.

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:39,300
I'm Chris Fields. And I'll be presenting this course in six sessions, and Ander will be organizing discussion sessions after each of those.

21
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,380
And all of this is explained on the course website.

22
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,040
So let's start!

23
00:01:49,210 --> 00:02:06,810
This is a course on "Physics as Information Processing," and this first session will be a historical perspective on the idea that physics is, or is about, information processing.

24
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:18,478
And I'll just start with a few quotations that span the middle of the 20th century - from **[Ludwig] Wittgenstein** in the 1920s saying "The world is all that is the case,"

25
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:23,490
so, defining the world in terms of facts, not objects;

26
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,410
**[Rolf] Landauer** in the early '60s, proclaiming that "Information is Physical;"

27
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:42,102
and then **John Archibald Wheeler**, who in many ways is the grandfather of this era recently, stating it is "It from Bit,"

28
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:47,850
so things come from information, i.e. bitstrings.

29
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:57,180
And if nothing else, this shows that formulations of this idea get pithier as the 20th century rolls on!

30
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:05,390
But the history goes back farther clearly than the 20th century.

31
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:16,354
But I'm only going to really talk about a piece of it and the timeline that I'll actually discuss today,

32
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:23,090
the most relevant history of this idea, goes back to the mid-19th Century.

33
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:31,750
And the first specific thing I'll talk about is **[Rudolf] Clausius**'s definition of entropy.

34
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:50,750
But with the beginning of the understanding of thermodynamics and the role of information in thermodynamics, you get this very interesting multidisciplinary progression of ideas that incorporates the beginning of quantum theory.

35
00:03:52,850 --> 00:04:12,900
And the beginning of **quantum theory** can kind of be dated to the [fifth]{first} **Solvay conference** in [1927]{1928}, and the famous debate between **[Nils] Bohr** and **[Albert] Einstein** over whether quantum theory is about knowledge, information - or [about] objects, things.

36
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:21,186
But it incorporates a lot of work in computer science and logic and mathematics.

37
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:35,062
So, interestingly, computer science was born effectively in the mid-30s with the work of **[Alonzo] Church** and **[Alan] Turing**, which very rapidly converged with the work in physics.

38
00:04:35,206 --> 00:04:39,530
So today we'll be talking about both computer science and physics.

39
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,880
And then in the second half of the 20th Century, this just exploded into a huge area.

40
00:04:48,050 --> 00:05:03,010
And in consequence of that mid-20th Century development, we're beginning to see a new idea about physics which is roughly encapsulated in quantum information theory.

41
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,494
And the new idea is this.

42
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:17,686
It's that what physics is actually about is information transfer across **boundaries** and the information... We can represent

43
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,978
the information transfer like this.

44
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:23,260
And this is a convention I'll use.

45
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,970
A **boundary** is always a blue ellipse.

46
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:39,360
And the agents that are exchanging information across this boundary are conventionally called Alice and Bob, which is just a more polite way of saying A and B.

47
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:49,890
And when you think about this picture, it becomes clear that what physics is really about is communication.

48
00:05:50,950 --> 00:06:05,750
And this is a wild redescription of the idea of what physics is, compared to the ideas of Newton or LaPlace or even the 19th century ideas.

49
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:33,810
And it's very different from the idea that's been preserved in 20th Century physics in the lineage of Einstein and others who viewed **classical physics** as, in a sense, either as completely fundamental or as a fundamental adjunct to quantum theory.

50
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:43,090
So this way of thinking about physics is a very deeply quantum-theoretic way of thinking about physics.

51
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:51,702
And where we're going in this course today is really "how did this all happen?"

52
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,400
It's the origin story.

53
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:15,600
And then in the next session, I want to discuss quantum information theory explicitly. And in particular, how quantum theory makes this conclusion that physics is about communication very simple and obvious, much more obvious than it is in classical physics where it takes _work_ to formulate this idea.

54
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:31,060
Then in the next session, we're going to talk about **semantics**, and how observations become meaningful to the agents who make them and hence how actions become meaningful to the agents who make them.

55
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:45,750
Then in August, we'll talk about **communication theory** a little bit more explicitly, and talk about how agents employ multiple communication channels when they're communicating.

56
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:55,974
And this is obvious when you think of people communicating: they not only talk to each other, they look at the same things, they point to things, et cetera.

57
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:59,950
So this is what I mean by multiple communication channels.

58
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:09,210
Then in September, we'll leverage that discussion to talk about how **spacetime** actually emerges from communication.

59
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,854
And this is one of the most important aspects, I think, of quantum information theory.

60
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:29,960
It provides us with a way of viewing spacetime as an emergent phenomenon, that communication is what is _fundamental_ in some ontological sense; and the _box_ in which it happens, spacetime, is not.

61
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:43,530
So in the final session in October we'll talk about applications to biology via the **Free Energy Principle**, and future directions both in physics and biology and elsewhere.

62
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,294
So it's going to be an interesting ride!

63
00:08:46,422 --> 00:09:01,150
I'm keeping formalism to a minimum, because we're directing this toward the _broad_ array of people who are interested in **Active Inference** and who are involved with the Active Inference Institute.

64
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:13,250
And I would ask you to hold questions (because we have a lot to get through in an hour) for the interactive discussion and for the discussion forum.

65
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:22,470
So I hope I explain things well enough that all of the concepts will be understandable.

66
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:30,780
If not, **Wikipedia** is actually a wonderful resource in this area for just definitions of terms.

67
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:37,894
So if there's anything that... just a term that is a trip-up, try Wikipedia.

68
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:41,006
It's probably a very good source for what these terms mean.

69
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:46,990
So let's start! Our story, as I said, begins in the 19th Century.

70
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:56,130
And in the mid-19th Century, lots of physicists were devoting their efforts to figuring out how to make better steam engines.

71
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:11,282
And one question that arises when you're trying to design a steam engine is "what happens _physically_ when you add heat to a system at constant temperature?"

72
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:15,350
So if you're building a steam engine, you've got a boiler, because you need to make steam.

73
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:22,330
And as you turn up the heat to your boiler, you get more steam, but the temperature doesn't change.

74
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,250
So this is a mystery.

75
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:34,670
What is the heat actually _adding_ to the boiler that is not increasing the temperature?

76
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:44,530
And Clausius responded to this question in a way that's sort of typical for a physicist or a mathematician.

77
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:52,478
Since he didn't know what the answer was, he just _invented a new name_ for whatever it was, and gave it a formal definition.

78
00:10:52,654 --> 00:11:05,270
So he called it **entropy**, which is a made-up word that, if it was translated from the Greek, would roughly mean "transformation content," en-tropy.

79
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:23,360
And he represented it by a simple equation that the change in this new concept, entropy, which is always called S, is just equal to the change in heat, Q, at constant temperature, T.

80
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:40,210
So obviously, this equation just reformulates the question in declarative form, saying "whatever this stuff is, its changes in this stuff are just changes in heat at constant temperature."

81
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,580
Well, heat is energy.

82
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:56,066
And this wasn't completely recognized in the mid-19th Century. But the way you'll see this equation in a current textbook is "dS is the change in _energy_ at constant temperature."

83
00:11:56,258 --> 00:12:04,010
So even more commonly, you would see it written as "the change in energy is equal to the temperature times the change in entropy."

84
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,950
It's the most common sort of textbook way of seeing this.

85
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,010
But the question, of course, is, "What _is_ this quantity?

86
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,498
What is this entropy?

87
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:15,440
What does this concept _mean?_"

88
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:33,300
And about 15 years after Clausius proposed it, **[Ludwig] Boltzmann** had the key insight, which is that "entropy is a measurement of _our uncertainty_ about the **state** the system is in."

89
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:53,820
And in particular, he again, of course, went to formalism, and said "the entropy, S, is equal to some constant times the number of states that the system can be in that look the same to us."

90
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:02,542
And since that number of states is enormous, the way to make that manageable is to take the _log_ of the number of states.

91
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:05,310
The **natural log** is _ln._

92
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,270
And this constant k is called **Boltzmann's constant**.

93
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:31,080
And Boltzmann was able to do this because he subscribed to a radical, very unpopular theory that material things, including gases like air, were made of atoms; and heat made the atoms move around.

94
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,646
And as you increase the amount of heat, the atoms can move in many different ways.

95
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:42,010
So the number of _states_ that they can be in that look the same to us _increases._

96
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,914
And that's what entropy is.

97
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:52,622
It's this increase in the number of states that the system can be in that all look the same to us with the measurements that we can make.

98
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:57,840
And since they look the same to us, we're _uncertain_ about exactly what state they're in.

99
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,870
So entropy is a measure of uncertainty.

100
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,370
This was really the beginning of modern physics,

101
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:15,014
because what it says now is that "decreasing uncertainty requires energy."

102
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:19,480
It links a measurement of uncertainty to a measurement of energy.

103
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:31,580
And if you think about the **uncertainty principle** in quantum theory, the core idea of the uncertainty principle is "you can't _measure_ a system without _disturbing_ it."

104
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:37,914
So to actually _act_ on a system requires energy.

105
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:40,400
And that's what you have to do to get information.

106
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,710
So here's Boltzmann, basically inventing quantum theory.

107
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,000
So we're going to fast forward by another 15 years, to 1900.

108
00:14:52,850 --> 00:15:03,540
And in 1900, **[Max] Planck** solved this problem called the "black-body radiation problem," which was basically "how much heat does your hot boiler give off into the air?"

109
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:18,766
And all of the measurements of the heat that hot boilers gave off to the air ran into problems in classical physics, and caused contradictions and quantities that went to infinity.

110
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,346
And all of that was bad.

111
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:27,078
So many people were trying to solve this problem. And Planck solved it by making a simple postulate.

112
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:32,570
He said "the energy of the radiation is proportional to its frequency."

113
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,440
So its _color_ in the case of light.

114
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:42,154
And if you go higher frequency, you end up in ultraviolet and X rays and gamma rays.

115
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:46,740
If you go to lower frequency, you go into microwaves and radio and all of that.

116
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,182
So this is a nice way of talking about radiation.

117
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,330
And it turned out that this solved the problem!

118
00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:03,590
I mean, just assuming this simple proportionality relationship produced spectra for black-body radiation that worked, that matched what you saw experimentally.

119
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,958
Well, this means something very important.

120
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:12,906
It means because this number _h_, the proportionality constant called **Planck's constant**, is a _number,_

121
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:14,198
it's finite,

122
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,930
it means that energy comes in discrete units of _h_.

123
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,080
You can have one _h_ or two _h_ or 10 million _h_, but you can't have half an _h_ of energy.

124
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,290
So it's quantized.

125
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,230
And this is widely recognized as the birth of quantum theory.

126
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,580
But of course, we should have known this already,

127
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,060
if we just thought a little bit,

128
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,890
right?

129
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:47,110
We know that changes of energy are proportional to changes in entropy by temperature.

130
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:56,120
And we know that entropy is a measure of the number of states, and numbers of states are just numbers.

131
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:08,140
You can have one state, two states, three states, 10 million states, 100 billion states, but they're all just a number - one, up.

132
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,486
And it's not infinite.

133
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:15,360
There's not an infinite number of states unless you have an infinite amount of energy, which you don't have.

134
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,910
So we knew already that entropy could only take discrete values.

135
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:28,530
And since energy and entropy are basically the same thing, we knew already that energy could only take discrete values.

136
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:37,030
So we _could_ have realized in 1900 that energy is quantized because the number of states is quantized.

137
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:47,446
So it shouldn't have really been a _mystery_ why energy was quantized. But it was a mystery, and it stayed a mystery, and it's still a mystery!

138
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:50,170
People still debate the meaning of quantum theory.

139
00:17:52,110 --> 00:18:11,870
But another thing we _could_ have known in 1900 was something _very_ important, and it's that this quantum of action, Planck's constant, which has units of action, which is energy times time, is intimately related to Boltzmann's constant.

140
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:19,970
And Boltzmann's constant has units of energy over temperature.

141
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,020
But this wasn't actually understood until the 1950s.

142
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,158
No one really figured {that} this out.

143
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:32,214
There was this relation until the 1950s.

144
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:37,290
And when it was figured out, it was figured out by a guy named **Gian Carlo Wick**.

145
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:49,930
And he introduced this notion of the **Wick rotation** by realizing that if you have an equation in classical physics, and in it there's the term "1 over kT,"

146
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,658
you can always replace that "1 over kT" with this other expression,

147
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:57,150
"_i_ _t_ over h-bar."

148
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:03,250
H-bar is just _h_ divided by 2 pi; and you'll get an equation that's valid in quantum theory.

149
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,730
And this is typically described in textbooks as "a trick."

150
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:14,760
And whenever something in physics is described as a trick, what that really means is it's something we don't understand.

151
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:21,030
And lots of papers have been written about the meaning of the Wick rotation.

152
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:29,980
But to start to understand the Wick rotation, I want to look at this equation a little bit.

153
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:43,134
"1 over kT" is 1 over an energy. And "_i_ _t_ over h-bar" is 1 over an energy,

154
00:19:43,252 --> 00:19:57,250
since h-bar is units of energy times time. We have time in this equation, and then we have this factor, _i_, which is typically thought of as just an imaginary number.

155
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,940
So it's the square root of minus one.

156
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,358
And - what's this "_i_" doing in this equation?

157
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:06,454
And in fact, you see factors of _i_ _t_ over h-bar

158
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:11,698
(if you're familiar with quantum theory) _everywhere_ in quantum theory!

159
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:16,040
So what's the meaning of this "imaginary number?"

160
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:34,670
And if you just think of "_i_ _t_," or of _i_, as this "arbitrary, imaginary number" that somehow renders the equation mysterious, then the whole of quantum theory is mysterious. But the Wick rotation is very mysterious.

161
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,990
But what _i_ is actually is an **operator**.

162
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:46,910
And if you think of the real numbers as an axis (which is always drawn horizontally)...

163
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,082
So here it is.

164
00:20:48,216 --> 00:20:52,482
Here's zero, and the axis is pointing that way.

165
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:56,326
{(I'm sorry - I can't get the camera really far enough away to see my arm here.)}

166
00:20:56,508 --> 00:20:58,070
So what is _i_?

167
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:05,190
_i_ is actually an operator that rotates the whole real axis by 90 degrees.

168
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:12,954
So if you see a plot of complex numbers, then the real numbers go this way, and the, quote, "imaginary numbers" go that way.

169
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:17,638
So what multiplying by _i_ has done is rotate by 90 degrees.

170
00:21:17,814 --> 00:21:26,400
And of course, if you do _i_ squared, you rotate _twice_ by 90 degrees (my arm won't do this), but you end up pointing _that_ way, and those are the negative numbers.

171
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:37,358
So _i_ is an operator that rotates something by 90 degrees, and if you rotate four times by 90 degrees, you're back to the identity.

172
00:21:37,534 --> 00:21:39,780
So _i_ to the fourth is one.

173
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:48,950
So this tells us something very interesting, which is that what the Wick rotation is really talking about is a rotation.

174
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,230
It's a geometrical equation.

175
00:21:53,290 --> 00:22:02,410
And in July, we'll come back to this and really probe what this Wick rotation _means, physically._

176
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:12,640
But as I said, this wasn't understood 'till the 1950s. And by the 1950s, a lot had happened.

177
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,954
So - quantum theory had been developed.

178
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,922
Bohr and Einstein had had their debate.

179
00:22:16,986 --> 00:22:18,814
Particle accelerators had been built.

180
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:20,574
The atomic bomb had been built.

181
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:29,794
Nuclear physics was well on its way. So an enormous amount of practical physics had been done.

182
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:31,966
Quantum theory was highly developed.

183
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:40,310
People were starting to think about quantum field theory before they made this simple realization that's formulated in the Wick rotation.

184
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,240
So this is a harbinger of things to come.

185
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:52,060
But before we continue in physics, we need to backtrack in time a little bit, and look at what the mathematicians were doing.

186
00:22:53,150 --> 00:23:05,146
So across the hall in the math department, one year after the Solvay conference, in 1929, Kurt Gödel proved his famous first incompleteness theorem.

187
00:23:05,338 --> 00:23:11,280
And the theorem states that "no formal system that contains arithmetic can be both consistent and complete."

188
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:25,880
And that means that either there are true statements that aren't provable in the formal system; _or_ there are false statements that are provable; _or,_ of course, both.

189
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:31,878
And Gödel's proof is actually extremely simple.

190
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:48,010
Almost all of the work in the proof is setting up all of the notation and procedures and so forth to formulate within arithmetic the sentence, "This sentence is not provable."

191
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:56,800
And once you have that sentence formulated within arithmetic, then the conclusion of the proof is obvious.

192
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:03,890
If you can prove the sentence, "this sentence is not provable," then you've proved something that's false.

193
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:10,686
And if you can't prove it, then there are sentences that you can't prove in arithmetic.

194
00:24:10,878 --> 00:24:33,686
So this was incredibly bad news for mathematicians who thought that finite discrete operations, which is what proofs are and also what computations are, can exhaustively enumerate the facts. And this was the assumption behind Wittgenstein's claim that "the world is all that is the case," the world is a collection of _facts._

195
00:24:33,878 --> 00:24:43,600
And optimistically, he thought that first order logic would allow us to enumerate all those facts and we'd be _done._ Dreams of a Final Theory, again!

196
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:56,690
So Gödel's theorem means that no system with finite capabilities, no system that can just do finite discrete operations, can fully describe its _environment._

197
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:03,810
It will always be in an environment where there are true things that aren't provable or false things that are provable.

198
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:12,040
But I think more relative to a discussion of agents, is that it means that no _agent_ can describe itself.

199
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:28,540
Any agent's theory of itself {will either contain true statements that it can't derive or false statements, or it} will either _miss_ true statements that it can't derive, or will end up deriving things that are false about itself.

200
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,320
Of course, we see this in psychology all the time.

201
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:44,190
So an immediate consequence of Gödel's theorem was an intense investigation of what computation actually _is,_ what it _meant_ to talk about finite discrete operations.

202
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,782
And two leaders of this were, of course, Church and Turing.

203
00:25:48,846 --> 00:26:00,440
And here's a picture of a Turing machine, which is just a little device with a couple of tapes, and a tape reader, and a simple logic unit that either writes a one or a zero if it sees a one or a zero.

204
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:17,530
And they defined a **computation** as a process that can be implemented in finite time by such a machine, or by Church's **lambda calculus**, or by any of the now hundreds of other methods that are provably equivalent to a Turing machine.

205
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,820
So what does _this_ mean?

206
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:29,200
It means that computation is a _physical_ process that can be mechanized; and it turns out, mechanized in any one of a huge array of ways.

207
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,846
It means that many different implementations of any computation are possible.

208
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:40,530
So I can do it on a Turing machine, I can do it on my laptop, I can do it on my head, et cetera.

209
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,554
The most important things it means is that there are questions with no computable answer.

210
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:48,306
This is the Revenge of Gödel's theorem.

211
00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:53,798
And two of the most famous questions of this kind are, "Given some arbitrary program,

212
00:26:53,884 --> 00:26:54,882
will it halt?

213
00:26:55,026 --> 00:26:57,578
Will it get to an answer in finite time?"

214
00:26:57,744 --> 00:27:02,410
And the answer to that question is, "This is undecidable.

215
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,260
No procedure can figure this out."

216
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:14,670
And the other undecidable question is, "Given some arbitrary program, what _function_ does it compute?"

217
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,730
And you'd think that would be simple, that you can read a program and figure out what function it computes.

218
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,502
But it turns out that is undecidable.

219
00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:27,620
That cannot be done by any finite process.

220
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:39,990
So this was another body blow to the goal of understanding everything with finite discrete processes.

221
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,366
But it also set the stage for something *new.*

222
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:56,380
It set the stage for thinking about an agent who interacts with a computational process by giving it an input, and then looking at its output some time later.

223
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:06,590
And this, of course, will look familiar, because I've included the blue ellipse, which is the boundary, which these days we call a "**user interface**."

224
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:17,700
And the user interface just allows some finite action on the system, and then the ability to observe some finite response by the system.

225
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:27,574
So we can now ask, "What can Alice determine by acting in some finite way, and then making some finite number of observations?" -

226
00:28:27,612 --> 00:28:28,200
i.e.

227
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:33,880
receiving some finite number of outputs from the system that she's acting on.

228
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:42,326
And the first 20 years of this produced a _large_ number of answers, all of them negative.

229
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:51,070
So to go back to Turing, he proved that Alice can't tell what's _implementing_ the function that she sees being implemented.

230
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,002
She can't tell whether a given input will lead to an output -

231
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:58,560
that's the **halting problem**.

232
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:05,380
**[Claude Elwood] Shannon** showed that Alice can't tell what the inputs _mean_ to the system -

233
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:11,330
his whole theory of communication is completely independent of semantics,

234
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:18,470
and his theory of communication actually accurately describes what Alice can observe.

235
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:29,130
**[Henry Gordon] Rice** is the one who proved that you can't determine what program is generating the outputs.

236
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:40,510
And then **[Darrell R.] Moore** proved a very similar result in a completely different formal setting of general cybernetics, that you can't tell what _process_ is generating the outputs by finite observation.

237
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:53,950
But what Alice _can_ do, is build a predictive _model_ of what generates the output she sees in response to her inputs, and test it by designing new inputs.

238
00:29:54,370 --> 00:30:00,930
And this is, of course, as **Karl Popper** told us, the process that we call "science."

239
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:07,080
So Alice can do science even though she can't answer any of these fundamental questions.

240
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:24,730
Now, this, of course, has a huge technological consequence. Since this theory of computation tells us that processes are effectively virtual,

241
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:31,306
we don't know what they are and we can't _determine_ what they are except in theory,

242
00:30:31,418 --> 00:30:41,600
by _making_ a theory. Technologically, it means we're free to _use_ virtualization everywhere because we have to deal with it anyway.

243
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,758
And this allows us to build multilevel architectures.

244
00:30:45,854 --> 00:30:55,960
It means that we can architect computers where no layer of the computation has any idea what's going on below or above it, and doesn't need to.

245
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,520
And that's what makes practical programming possible.

246
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:18,780
So from these no-go theorems that tell you what you _can't_ do, you actually get an enormous boost into [inaudible] and use, to probe the world and develop theories and on and on and on.

247
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:31,680
So in a sense, Gödel birthed not only computer science, but practical computing by showing us that virtualization is just the way the world works.

248
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:48,230
So now let's go back to physics, where these ideas were replicated, basically reintroduced, reinvented by Feynman in developing his path integral formulation of quantum theory.

249
00:31:48,570 --> 00:32:01,882
And basically what Feyman realized was that in any physical process, the observer, Alice, prepares some state that she's interested in.

250
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:04,730
She prepares some input to an experiment.

251
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:12,080
Then she lets something happen, and then she sees what the result of the experiment is.

252
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,110
And the canonical experiment in physics is scattering.

253
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:24,420
You {you know} fire two protons at each other, and they intersect someplace, and stuff comes out, and you measure the stuff that comes out.

254
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:32,580
And what you can measure is momentum and spin energy, things like that, position.

255
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:41,762
So these processes conserve the total values of the things you can measure.

256
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:54,940
So in particular, they preserve momentum and angular momentum, and they preserve {you know} other things that are harder to measure and are only approximately conserved anyway, like **lepton number**.

257
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:16,020
But Feynman's contribution to this way of thinking about experiments was to say, "Look, if you want to understand the output, you have to _sum_ over all of the possible processes that could have produced the output from the input, no matter how improbable they are."

258
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:36,370
So the famous idea from Feynman **diagrams** is if you have an electron that's scattering off an atom, you measure the initial state of the electron that you've generated with an accelerator or something, and you measure the final state, which involves momentum and spin and so forth.

259
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:55,120
And for all you knew, partway through the process, the electron disappeared, and an entire universe appeared and then annihilated with a copy of an entire anti-universe, and the electron came back out!

260
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:03,570
And you have to include processes like that if you really want to understand and correctly predict the outcomes of your measurements.

261
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:16,274
And **Murray Gell-Mann** lifted the bumper sticker slogan from T. H. White in the book "The Once and Future King," "Everything not explicitly forbidden is mandatory."

262
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:18,520
That sums up Feynman's idea.

263
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:32,490
And this is called the **totalitarian principle**, since it's what's written in T. H. White's section in the book "The Once and Future King" on the kingdom of the ants, for which "everything not explicitly forbidden is mandatory."

264
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:40,026
So let's think about a real example that's {a bit actually it's...} the same as scattering.

265
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:45,470
The ultimate scattering experiment in physics is a black hole.

266
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:51,840
Stuff goes into the horizon, stars, whole galaxies, whatever.

267
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,322
Something happens, and stuff comes out.

268
00:34:56,376 --> 00:35:10,840
And what comes out is **Hawking radiation**, and information is conserved if the information in the Hawking radiation is actually the same as the information in the "stuff" that went in.

269
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:15,650
And conservation is not qualitative.

270
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,910
It's quantitative.

271
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:21,130
It's only the **quantity of information** that's supposed to be preserved.

272
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:30,270
And you can ask, "How much is the information that's being emitted by a black hole that's emitting Hawking radiation?"

273
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:37,658
And **[Jacob David] Bekenstein** was the one who figured this out, using an incredibly simple argument.

274
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:40,160
But I'll just give the answer here.

275
00:35:40,530 --> 00:36:02,920
The answer is that the total entropy of the black hole is its area divided by four. And the area in this equation has to be computed in **Planck units**, which are units where Planck's constant and the speed of light and Boltzmann's constant and other interesting things are all set equal to _one._

276
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:12,810
So one Planck area is the Planck length squared, which turns out to be about ten to the minus 70th meters squared.

277
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:18,460
So this says that black holes are the most entropic entities we know of.

278
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:39,730
So a black hole about this big [gesturing], with a radius of about a meter, has an entropy of about ten to the 70th, which is, of course, an astonishingly big number. And a black hole with the area of the sun -

279
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:52,440
so a moderate sized cosmological black hole, a real thing that we can observe with a gravity wave telescope or something - has an entropy of about ten to the 79th.

280
00:36:52,810 --> 00:37:04,300
And really big black holes, which are bigger than the entire solar system, have entropies into the ten to the 80th, 10 to the 85th, or something.

281
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,650
So these are enormously entropic entities.

282
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,998
But Beckenstein didn't just tell us that.

283
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:20,830
He told us something about the _structure_ of the interface, the horizon of a black hole.

284
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,700
And this is what he told us.

285
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:36,950
You can compute entropy in bits just by using logs base two instead of logs base _e_, natural logs.

286
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:43,560
And that's just multiplying the natural log by about 1.4.

287
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:52,620
So we can write the entropy {of black hole,} of black hole in units of bits, and it's about a over six.

288
00:37:53,630 --> 00:38:00,270
So what does this mean to say that we can think of the entropy in terms of _bits?_

289
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:28,690
What it says is that we can think of the interface in terms of a bit array. And we can think of all of these bits as encoded on this interface at a density of one bit every roughly six Planck lengths squared, six plank areas.

290
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,470
So this is an incredibly dense encoding in a black hole.

291
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,014
And it's an interesting idea about black holes.

292
00:38:37,062 --> 00:38:41,498
But what gets really interesting is what happens when you _generalize_ it.

293
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:47,260
And of course, physicists are prone to generalization, and that's what happened _next._

294
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:57,150
**Gerard 't Hooft**, almost immediately thereafter, on the basis of Beckenstein's work, formulated the **Holographic Principle**.

295
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:06,050
And what the Holographic Principle says is "We can think of _any_ system as _approximately_ a black hole.

296
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:10,210
And the only approximation is the encoding density."

297
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:21,042
The _boundary_ of any system encodes the information that we can _get_ about the system at some density.

298
00:39:21,106 --> 00:39:26,150
And the density is less than the density for a black hole because we're not black holes.

299
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:39,130
And this rules out a lot by limiting the amount of information that you can _extract_ from a system to the amount of information that you can actually _write on its boundary._

300
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:45,406
And one of the things that it rules out is knowing the **geometry** on the inside of the system.

301
00:39:45,588 --> 00:40:02,034
And 't Hooft put it this way, which I think is a brilliant thought experiment. He says, "Look, the metric inside this system can be _so curved,_ effectively the space time inside the system can be so curved, that you could stick an entire universe inside.

302
00:40:02,232 --> 00:40:09,750
And we never know, because it wouldn't change the amount of entropy, number of bits that are encoded on the boundary.

303
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,494
So the inside geometry can be anything.

304
00:40:13,692 --> 00:40:15,414
And you can't find out by

305
00:40:15,452 --> 00:40:17,740
looking at the outside of the system."

306
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:24,010
Now, the Holographic Principle almost follows from classical physics!

307
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:40,670
There's **[Leonhard]** **Euler's theorem**, which tells you about one over R squared forces, and you can think of the force as penetrating the boundary at some density.

308
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:51,330
And the difference between Euler's theorem and the Holographic Principle is just that the density in classical physics can go to infinity.

309
00:40:51,990 --> 00:41:00,466
And in the Holographic Principle, it can only go to this maximal density that's achieved by a black hole.

310
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:01,110
Why?

311
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:09,100
Because if you try to get any higher, more information, the information gets sucked into the black hole, and you can't get it out.

312
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:24,560
So the Holographic Principle becomes a _guiding principle_ for thinking about any physical system and what it means to extract information from a physical system.

313
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:28,974
And in fact (we'll talk about this next time),

314
00:41:29,172 --> 00:41:35,060
you can say exactly what the information encoded on the boundary of any system _is._

315
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:53,106
And what I'll go through next time is seeing that the information that's encoded on the boundary is a specification of the energy that's being exchanged by the interaction, which, of course, is linear in the number of bits.

316
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:55,830
It's just counting the number of bits.

317
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:57,980
Okay!

318
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:19,630
So with the Holographic Principle, we now have a complete new science about systems that are exchanging finite discrete information across a boundary by encoding that information _on_ the boundary and then reading the information _off_ the boundary.

319
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:25,650
So here's a new way of thinking about physical interaction.

320
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:38,658
Alice writes a message _on_ her boundary with Bob, and Bob reads the message _off_ the boundary, and then writes his own new message, which Alice then reads.

321
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:42,280
And of course, that's what's happening _right now._

322
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:50,886
I'm writing information by speaking _on_ an interface, which is effectively the Internet.

323
00:42:51,078 --> 00:42:56,250
And you're reading that information _off_ the Internet by listening to it.

324
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:04,030
And when we get time for questions, you'll be writing information on the Internet, which I'll be reading.

325
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:09,658
Now, the key thing about this new science is that it's **topological**.

326
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:16,942
It's about connectivity across some communication channel, which we represent as a boundary.

327
00:43:17,086 --> 00:43:22,930
It's not geometric, so it doesn't assume anything about spacetime.

328
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:33,030
So it allows us to _build a model_ of _space_ in particular as an emergent phenomenon.

329
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:47,100
And it allows us to see _time_ as not some absolute external abstraction, but something that the communicating agents measure for themselves.

330
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,920
And so they each act in their _own time._

331
00:43:53,090 --> 00:44:00,906
And we get a very natural measure of time in terms of how many bits I see coming across my boundary.

332
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:11,250
And again, we'll talk about that in the next couple of sessions, and then talk about it more thoroughly in September when we talk about emergent spacetime.

333
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:24,882
So quantum information theory looks very different from the physics that came before, not because it's adopted a new formalism, the tools of quantum theory;

334
00:44:25,026 --> 00:44:41,840
it's because it's entirely changed the _thinking_ about what physics _is_ and what it's _about,_ and replaced this idea of forces and balls banging into each other and all of that with the idea of communication between agents.

335
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:47,310
And of course that's familiar from an Active Inference perspective.

336
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:55,710
So we can now back up a little bit to see what they were doing in _classical_ physics during this period.

337
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,682
{Well, let me go on a little bit.

338
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:58,340
Sorry.}

339
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:14,226
This is just a slide quoting Wheeler, who of course is the most radical {in terms of} and _pithiest,_ in terms of formulating these ideas.

340
00:45:14,418 --> 00:45:18,250
But here's his characterization of this new physics.

341
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:20,490
It's not reductive:

342
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,930
all of the reasoning is circular;

343
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:31,630
you don't have smaller things and then yet smaller things, and then yet smaller things forever.

344
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,510
There are no laws:

345
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:41,070
so what you see on the interface is a message;

346
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:47,090
it's not something that's governed by laws since the beginning of the universe.

347
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,406
There's no continuum:

348
00:45:49,518 --> 00:45:52,050
so there's nothing described by real numbers;

349
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,930
it's all described by integers;

350
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:56,710
everything's done in finite dimensional spaces.

351
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:02,280
And finally, and most importantly, there's no "spacetime _box_" in which things happen.

352
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:06,294
So think of how radical this is!

353
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:13,290
It means there's no big bang, there's no big rip, there's no bouncing universe.

354
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:19,290
All of those ideas are out the window because they're classical and they're about spacetime.

355
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:27,390
And what the new physics wants to do is derive spacetime out of basically users' experiences.

356
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:36,142
So the agents here are all "observer-participants" in Wheeler's language.

357
00:46:36,206 --> 00:46:44,450
But what that just means is _agents_ that want to communicate. And it's their communication that gives rise to physics.

358
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:58,810
So _now_ we'll go back to classical physics. And what was happening, or one thing that was happening in classical physics at that time, was a lot of thinking about **stochastic causal networks**.

359
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:15,130
And **[Judea] Pearl** realized that if you have any stochastic causal network that's **unidirectional**, then around any **node**, you can draw what he called a **Markov blanket**.

360
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:37,080
And a Markov blanket is just the set of nodes in the network that absorb all outside causation and then transmit that causation into whatever node you're interested in; and then absorb all causation coming from the node you're interested in and transmit it to the rest of the world.

361
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:44,642
And so we can redraw that in "part b" here, and it should look very familiar.

362
00:47:44,706 --> 00:47:49,900
A Markov blanket is just a classical-physics way of talking about a **holographic screen**.

363
00:47:50,670 --> 00:48:04,874
And the number of nodes in the Markov blanket, or in particular the number of **degrees of freedom** times the number of nodes, is just the number of bits that flow across that Markov blanket.

364
00:48:04,922 --> 00:48:09,520
So it's the entropy of the effective holographic screen.

365
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:18,210
All these ideas were reinvented more or less independently within classical physics.

366
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:29,730
And it was from this classical physics background that **Karl Friston** came up with the idea that a Markov blanket defines a persistent

367
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,550
[**** inaudible ****] [**thing**, a system that persists through time],

368
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:41,960
at least from an Active Inference Institute point of view everyone is familiar with, because it's the foundation of the idea of Active Inference.

369
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:56,140
Any system that persists through time does so by making sure that it doesn't dissolve into its environment.

370
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,284
Well, what does that _mean?_

371
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:07,040
It means it persists through time by maintaining the integrity of its Markov blanket, or the integrity of its boundary.

372
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:27,380
So this of course is just a tautology. But it's a very interesting and very productive tautology, because it says that any system is using the information it gets on its boundary from its environment to build a model of how its environment behaves.

373
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:35,690
And then it uses that model to act back on its environment to test and refine its model.

374
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,490
And again, as Popper told us, this is just what _science_ is.

375
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:49,470
So what the free energy principle really tells us is that all systems are agents that are doing science all the time.

376
00:49:50,400 --> 00:50:11,060
So physics is effectively not just the study of communication, but it's the study of agents doing science with each other, pairs of agents who are trying to figure each other out by their communicative exchanges.

377
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:43,020
So that's the history of how we got from {1930s sorry,} 1850s thermodynamics to the free energy principle, and how the free energy principle connects to these very deep and extremely radical (especially within context) ideas in quantum theory and quantum cosmology and computer science.

378
00:50:43,540 --> 00:51:19,560
All of which tell us that the world we see is a projection that's being written on our boundaries by a process that we have no access to - except the procedure of Active Inference, or the procedure of science - which is to formulate predictive models and test them by doing things in the world and seeing how the world responds.

379
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,260
So that's it for this session.

380
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:37,250
The first discussion session, which Ander is going to lead, will be the 3rd of June at this same time, i.e. 5 o'clock European time.

381
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,960
And then my session number two will be in mid June.

382
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:51,910
And if you look at the course website [1st Discussion; 2nd Lecture](https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/fields-physics-2023/questions-answers-3), there's this subsidiary website for interactive Q and A.

383
00:51:52,360 --> 00:52:12,060
And I invite everyone to post questions, and discuss them; and hope that we'll have an interesting exchange and that everyone will come to sort of an understanding of what was talked about today through discussion.

384
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:20,888
And we'll be interested in being back in June to see how to formulate this in quantum theory.

385
00:52:20,984 --> 00:52:31,424
So thank you very much and thank you again, Daniel, for organizing this and hosting it and putting together all the technical things necessary to pull this off.

386
00:52:31,622 --> 00:52:33,570
I could never do that on my own.

387
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:35,744
Thank you.

388
00:52:35,782 --> 00:52:38,550
We're really excited here.

389
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,816
Any closing thoughts?

390
00:52:40,848 --> 00:52:45,140
Or Ander, I'd love to hear your reflection just briefly.

391
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:52,570
How would you have told that history; or how does that history reflect on the areas that you're familiar with?

392
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,890
Well, I don't think I have much to add.

393
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:03,176
I've been mainly interested in the Wick rotation part.

394
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:07,020
I'm excited to hear more about that, Chris.

395
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,620
But no, I found this to be a very nice summary.

396
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:28,710
I'm less familiar with the staff on computation, formal computation, despite being a mathematician by training, it was a little more familiar with all the physics stuff, but yeah, I thought it was great.

397
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,436
Thank you.

398
00:53:30,618 --> 00:53:31,508
All right.

399
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:32,244
Thank you.

400
00:53:32,282 --> 00:53:33,396
I will close it.

401
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:36,320
So in about two weeks, we'll have the first discussion.

402
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,272
Everyone's welcome to join.

403
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:42,996
I will share with Ander and Chris the questions, and we can develop that.

404
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:47,584
And we'll have that on the course front end before the coming discussion.

405
00:53:47,712 --> 00:53:49,344
So thanks again, fellows.

406
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,500
See you next time.
