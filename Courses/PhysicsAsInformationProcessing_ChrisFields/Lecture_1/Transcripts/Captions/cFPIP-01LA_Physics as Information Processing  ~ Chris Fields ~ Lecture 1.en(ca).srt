00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:07,848
Daniel: Hello and welcome, everyone, to

2
00:00:07,848 --> 00:00:09,045
the active inference institute.

3
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:12,365
This is session one of the course physics

4
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:15,633
as Information Processing with Chris

5
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:16,700
Fields.

6
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,976
First we'll have Andrea Guere and Chris

7
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:19,029
Fields.

8
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:20,121
Introduce themselves.

9
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:22,391
And then we'll carry on with the first

10
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:23,451
lecture.

11
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:24,512
Here.

12
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:26,775
Check out the video description for a

13
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:29,003
link to the course course overview

14
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:31,272
website where you can ask questions that

15
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:34,541
will be answered asynchronously register

16
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,810
to participate in the discussions, which

17
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,079
happen about two weeks after each of the

18
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,348
six lecture sessions and just learn more

19
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:44,504
about this area.

20
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:47,838
So thank you both so much for joining

21
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:49,021
into this adventure.

22
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:51,208
We are starting now.

23
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:53,410
And first, please Aguirre Giray,

24
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,527
introduce yourself.

25
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:57,811
And then Chris introduction and lecture.

26
00:00:57,817 --> 00:00:58,895
Thank you.

27
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,528
Ander: Hello.

28
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,719
So I'll be the course assistant.

29
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:05,060
I'm a postdoc in math, specializing in

30
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,321
improbability, and I have a deep interest

31
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:10,526
in the physics of information.

32
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:12,785
And I've been familiar with Chris's

33
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:14,912
papers for a while.

34
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:16,117
So, yeah, just here to learn myself.

35
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:20,529
Chris: Thank you, Andrew.

36
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:21,681
And thank you, Daniel.

37
00:01:22,723 --> 00:01:27,201
I'm Chris Fields and I'll be presenting

38
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:31,679
this course in six sessions and Aguirre

39
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:36,144
will be organizing discussion sessions

40
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:39,426
after each of those.

41
00:01:39,463 --> 00:01:42,717
And all of this is explained on the

42
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:43,833
course website.

43
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:48,029
So let's start.

44
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:52,072
This is a course on physics as

45
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:56,111
information processing, and this first

46
00:01:56,111 --> 00:02:00,093
session will be historical perspective on

47
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:04,130
the idea that physics is or is about

48
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,158
information processing.

49
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:10,193
And I'll just start with a few quotations

50
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:13,222
that span the middle of the 20th century

51
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:16,250
from Wittgenstein in 1920s saying the

52
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,274
world is all that is the case.

53
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:22,312
So defining the world in terms of facts,

54
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:23,324
not objects.

55
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,361
Landauer in the early 60s proclaiming

56
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:29,383
that information is physical.

57
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:34,433
And then John Archibald Wheeler, who in

58
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:38,473
many ways is the grandfather of this era,

59
00:02:38,473 --> 00:02:42,510
recently stating it is it from Bit.

60
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:46,554
So things come from information, I E

61
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:47,568
bitstrings.

62
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:51,607
And if nothing else, this shows that

63
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:54,638
formulations of this idea get pithier as

64
00:02:54,638 --> 00:02:57,661
the 20th century rolls on.

65
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:02,659
But the history goes back farther clearly

66
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:05,683
than the 20th century.

67
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:09,729
But I'm only going to really talk about a

68
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:13,767
piece of it and the timeline that I'll

69
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:16,793
actually discuss today.

70
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:19,828
The most relevant history of this idea

71
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:23,860
goes back to the mid 19th century.

72
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:27,908
And the first specific thing I'll talk

73
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:31,946
about is Clausia's definition of entropy.

74
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:31,947
.

75
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,981
But with the beginning of the

76
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,011
understanding of thermodynamics and the

77
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:41,041
role of information in thermodynamics,

78
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,064
you get this very interesting

79
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:46,093
multidisciplinary progression of ideas

80
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:49,120
that incorporates the beginning of

81
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,137
quantum theory.

82
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:56,193
And the beginning of quantum theory can

83
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:59,225
kind of be dated to the first Solve

84
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:03,201
conference in 1928 and the famous debate

85
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,236
between Bohr and Einstein over whether

86
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:09,267
quantum theory is about knowledge,

87
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:12,298
information or objects things.

88
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:17,345
But it incorporates a lot of work in

89
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:20,370
computer science and logic and

90
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,381
mathematics.

91
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:24,415
So, interestingly, computer science was

92
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:28,449
Born effectively in the mid 30s with the

93
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:31,481
work of Church and Turing, which very

94
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,510
rapidly converged with the work in

95
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,520
physics.

96
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:37,545
So today we'll be talking about both

97
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,564
computer science and physics.

98
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:43,605
And then in the second half of the 20th

99
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:46,633
century, this just exploded into a huge

100
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:46,638
area.

101
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,681
And in consequence of that mid 20th

102
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:54,717
century development, we're beginning to

103
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:58,750
see a new idea about physics which is

104
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,719
roughly encapsulated in quantum

105
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:03,740
information theory.

106
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:05,764
And the new idea is this.

107
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:09,806
It's that what physics is actually about

108
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:13,847
is information transfer across boundaries

109
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:17,886
and the information we can represent.

110
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:19,909
The information transfer like this.

111
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:23,942
And this is a convention I'll use.

112
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,979
A boundary is always a blue ellipse.

113
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,014
And the agents that are exchanging

114
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:33,039
information across this boundary are

115
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,065
conventionally called Alice and Bob,

116
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:38,094
which is just a more polite way of saying

117
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:39,103
A and B.

118
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:44,150
And when you think about this picture, it

119
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,186
becomes clear that what physics is really

120
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:49,208
about is communication.

121
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:55,260
And this is a wild redescription of the

122
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,302
idea of what physics is compared to the

123
00:05:59,302 --> 00:06:03,283
ideas of Newton or LaPlace or even the

124
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:05,307
19th century ideas.

125
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:10,353
And it's very different from the idea

126
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:14,394
that's been preserved in 20th century

127
00:06:14,394 --> 00:06:18,437
physics in the lineage of Einstein and

128
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:23,481
others who viewed classical physics as,

129
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:26,517
in a sense, either as completely

130
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:31,560
fundamental or as a fundamental adjunct

131
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,587
to quantum theory.

132
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:37,628
So this way of thinking about physics is

133
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:41,659
a very deeply quantum theoretic way of

134
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,680
thinking about physics.

135
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:47,723
And where we're going in this course

136
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:51,766
today is really how did this all happen?

137
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,783
It's the origin story.

138
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:57,823
And then in the next session, I want to

139
00:06:57,823 --> 00:06:59,846
discuss quantum information theory

140
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:02,816
explicitly and in particular, how quantum

141
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:05,844
theory makes this conclusion that physics

142
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:08,871
is about communication very simple and

143
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:10,899
obvious, much more obvious than it is in

144
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:13,926
classical physics where it takes work to

145
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:15,945
formulate this idea.

146
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:19,985
Then in the next session, we're going to

147
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:22,015
talk about semantics and how observations

148
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:25,044
become meaningful to the agents who make

149
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,068
them and hence how actions become

150
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:31,100
meaningful to the agents who make them.

151
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:34,136
Then in August, we'll talk about

152
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:37,166
communication theory a little bit more

153
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,193
explicitly and talk about how agents

154
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,223
employ multiple communication channels

155
00:07:43,223 --> 00:07:45,247
when they're communicating.

156
00:07:46,253 --> 00:07:48,276
And this is obvious when you think of

157
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:51,300
people communicating, they not only talk

158
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,322
to each other, they look at the same

159
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:55,349
things, they point to things, et cetera.

160
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:58,372
So this is what I mean by multiple

161
00:07:58,372 --> 00:07:59,388
communication channels.

162
00:08:00,334 --> 00:08:03,363
Then in September, we'll leverage that

163
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:06,392
discussion to talk about how spacetime

164
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:09,422
actually emerges from communication.

165
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,442
And this is one of the most important

166
00:08:11,442 --> 00:08:13,463
aspects, I think, of quantum information

167
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:13,468
theory.

168
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:16,499
It provides us with a way of viewing

169
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:20,533
spacetime as an emergent phenomenon, that

170
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,565
communication is what is fundamental in

171
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:26,597
some ontological sense, and the box in

172
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:29,629
which it happens, spacetime is not.

173
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,670
So the final session in October will talk

174
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,698
about applications to biology via the

175
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:39,722
free energy principle and future

176
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:42,751
directions both in physics and biology

177
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,764
and elsewhere.

178
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:46,792
So it's going to be an interesting ride.

179
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,819
I'm keeping formalism to a minimum

180
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:51,849
because we're directing this toward the

181
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:55,879
broad array of people who are interested

182
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,910
in active inference and who are involved

183
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,881
with the Active Inference Institute.

184
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:04,917
And I would ask you to hold questions

185
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,947
because we have a lot to get through in

186
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,977
an hour for the interactive discussion

187
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:13,002
and for the discussion forum.

188
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:18,051
So I hope I explain things well enough

189
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:20,079
that all of the concepts will be

190
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,094
understandable.

191
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,136
If not, Wikipedia is actually a wonderful

192
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:28,159
resource in this area for just

193
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,177
definitions of terms.

194
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:34,217
So if there's anything that just a term

195
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:37,248
that is a trip up, try Wikipedia.

196
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:40,270
It's probably a very good source for what

197
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,279
these terms mean.

198
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,314
So let's start our story, as I said,

199
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:46,339
begins in the 19th century.

200
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:49,368
And in the mid 19th century, lots of

201
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:52,397
physicists were devoting their efforts to

202
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:55,423
figuring out how to make better steam

203
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:56,430
engines.

204
00:09:56,438 --> 00:10:00,416
And one question that arises when you're

205
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:04,452
trying to design a steam engine is what

206
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:08,490
happens physically when you add heat to a

207
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,522
system at constant temperature?

208
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:13,542
So if you're building a steam engine, you'

209
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:14,558
've got a boiler, because you need to

210
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:15,563
make steam.

211
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:18,590
And as you turn up the heat to your

212
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,613
boiler, you get more steam, but the

213
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:22,633
temperature doesn't change.

214
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:24,652
So this is a mystery.

215
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:29,706
What is the heat actually adding to the

216
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:33,741
boiler that is not increasing the

217
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:34,756
temperature?

218
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,799
And Clausius responded to this question

219
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,829
in a way that's sort of typical for a

220
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,854
physicist or a mathematician.

221
00:10:45,863 --> 00:10:47,887
Since he didn't know what the answer was,

222
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:50,910
he just invented a new name for whatever

223
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,934
it was and gave it a formal definition.

224
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:56,971
So he called it entropy, which is a made

225
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:59,005
up word that, if it was translated from

226
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:02,971
the Greek, would roughly mean

227
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:05,002
transformation content in trophy.

228
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:09,044
And he represented it by a simple

229
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:12,078
equation that the change in this new

230
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,119
concept entropy, which is always called S,

231
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:20,156
, is just equal to the change in heat Q

232
00:11:20,156 --> 00:11:23,183
at constant temperature t.

233
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:26,215
So obviously, this equation just

234
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:30,250
reformulates the question in declarative

235
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,286
form, saying whatever this stuff is, its

236
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:37,322
changes in this stuff are just changes in

237
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,351
heat at constant temperature.

238
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:42,375
Well, heat is energy.

239
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:45,408
And this wasn't completely recognized in

240
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:48,438
the mid 19th century, but the way you'll

241
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:51,467
see this equation in a current textbook

242
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:54,498
is DS is the change in energy at constant

243
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:56,510
temperature.

244
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:58,535
So even more commonly, you would see it

245
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:01,500
written as the change in energy is equal

246
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,523
to the temperature times the change in

247
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:04,530
entropy.

248
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:07,566
It's the most common sort of textbook way

249
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:08,579
of seeing this.

250
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:11,602
But the question, of course, is, what is

251
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:12,609
this quantity?

252
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,624
What is this entropy?

253
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,644
What does this concept mean?

254
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:19,687
And about 15 years after Klausius

255
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:23,729
proposed it, Boltzman had the key insight,

256
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:27,769
, which is that entropy is a measurement

257
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:31,807
of our uncertainty about the state the

258
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:33,822
system is in.

259
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:38,875
And in particular, he again, of course,

260
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,917
went to formalism and said, the entropy S

261
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:46,953
is equal to some constant times the

262
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:50,994
number of states that the system can be

263
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:53,027
in that look the same to us.

264
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:56,059
And since that number of states is

265
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,085
enormous, the way to make that manageable

266
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:01,048
is to take the log of the number of

267
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,055
states.

268
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:05,083
The natural log is ln.

269
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,124
And this constant k is called Baltimore's

270
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:10,132
constant.

271
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:15,187
And Baltimore was able to do this because

272
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:18,219
he subscribed to a radical, very

273
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:22,257
unpopular theory that material things,

274
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:26,294
including gases like air, were made of

275
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:30,336
atoms and heat made the atoms move around.

276
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:31,340
.

277
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:34,370
And as you increase the amount of heat,

278
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,395
the atoms can move in many different ways.

279
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:36,396
.

280
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:39,424
So the number of states that they can be

281
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:42,449
in that look the same to us increases.

282
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:43,468
And that's what entropy is.

283
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:46,491
It's this increase in the number of

284
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:48,517
states that the system can be in that all

285
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:51,543
look the same to us with the measurements

286
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:52,555
that we can make.

287
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:55,580
And since they look the same to us, we're

288
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,603
uncertain about exactly what state they'

289
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:57,607
're in.

290
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,588
So entropy is a measure of uncertainty.

291
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,627
This was really the beginning of modern

292
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:06,633
physics.

293
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:10,678
Because what it says now is that

294
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:15,719
decreasing uncertainty requires energy.

295
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,748
It links a measurement of uncertainty to

296
00:14:17,748 --> 00:14:19,764
a measurement of energy.

297
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:23,800
And if you think about the uncertainty

298
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,825
principle in quantum theory, the core

299
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:28,852
idea of the uncertainty principle is you

300
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:31,880
can't measure a system without disturbing

301
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:31,885
it.

302
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:36,939
So to actually act on a system requires

303
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:37,948
energy.

304
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:39,967
And that's what you have to do to get

305
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:40,973
information.

306
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,014
So here's Boltzman, basically, inventing

307
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:45,026
quantum theory.

308
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:50,075
So we're going to fast forward by another

309
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:52,089
15 years, to 1900.

310
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:55,124
And in 1900, Planck solved this problem

311
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:58,151
called the black body radiation problem,

312
00:14:58,151 --> 00:15:00,117
which was basically how much heat does

313
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:03,145
your hot boiler give off into the air?

314
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:07,185
And all of the measurements of the heat

315
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:10,217
that hot boilers gave off to the air ran

316
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:13,248
into problems in classical physics and

317
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:17,280
caused contradictions and quantities that

318
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,297
went to infinity.

319
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:20,313
And all of that was bad.

320
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:23,341
So many people were trying to solve this

321
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:25,368
problem, and Planck solved it by making a

322
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:27,380
simple postulate.

323
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:30,411
He said the energy of the radiation is

324
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:32,435
proportional to its frequency.

325
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:35,464
So its color in the case of light.

326
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:38,498
And if you go higher frequency, you end

327
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:41,525
up in ultraviolet and X rays and gamma

328
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,531
rays.

329
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:44,555
If you go to lower frequency, you go into

330
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:46,576
microwaves and radio and all of that.

331
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:50,613
So this is a nice way of talking about

332
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:51,621
radiation.

333
00:15:51,622 --> 00:15:52,638
And it turned out that this solved the

334
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:53,642
problem.

335
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:55,664
I mean, just assuming this simple

336
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,688
proportionality relationship produced

337
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:00,652
spectra for black body radiation that

338
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:02,673
worked, that matched what you saw

339
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:03,685
experimentally.

340
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:05,709
Well, this means something very important.

341
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:05,709
.

342
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,734
It means because this number h, the

343
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,762
proportionality constant called plaque's

344
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,778
constant, is a number.

345
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:14,791
It's Finite.

346
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:17,820
It means that energy comes in discrete

347
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:17,829
units of H.

348
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,859
You can have one H or two H or 10 million

349
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:24,889
H, but you can't have half an H of energy.

350
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:24,890
.

351
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:27,922
So it's quantized.

352
00:16:27,924 --> 00:16:29,946
And this is widely recognized as the

353
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,961
birth of quantum theory.

354
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:34,990
But of course, we should have known this

355
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:34,995
already.

356
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:37,020
If we just thought a little bit.

357
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:37,028
Right.

358
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,065
We Know that changes of energy are

359
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:45,105
proportional to changes in entropy by

360
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,120
temperature.

361
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,158
And we know that entropy is a measure of

362
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:53,188
the number of states, and numbers of

363
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:56,210
states are just numbers.

364
00:16:56,216 --> 00:17:00,194
You can have one state, two states, three

365
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:03,228
states, 10 million states, 100 billion

366
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:07,262
states, but they're all just a number,

367
00:17:07,262 --> 00:17:08,271
one up.

368
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:10,294
And it's not infinite.

369
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,312
There's not an infinite number of states

370
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:13,329
unless you have an infinite amount of

371
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,343
energy, which you don't have.

372
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,378
So we knew already that entropy could

373
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:20,398
only take discrete values.

374
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:23,422
And since energy and entropy are

375
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:25,447
basically the same thing, we knew already

376
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:27,468
that energy could only take discrete

377
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:28,475
values.

378
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,510
So we could have realized in 1900 that

379
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,542
energy is quantized because the number of

380
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,559
states is quantized.

381
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:40,594
So it shouldn't have really been a

382
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:43,619
mystery why energy was quantized, but it

383
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,644
was a mystery, and it stayed a mystery,

384
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:47,663
and it said, still a mystery.

385
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:50,693
People still debate the meaning of

386
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:53,724
quantum theory, but another thing we

387
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:56,756
could have known in 1900 was something

388
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:59,786
very important, and it's that this

389
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:02,758
quantum of action, planck's constant,

390
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:05,788
which has units of action, which is

391
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:09,822
energy times time, is intimately related

392
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,848
to Boltzman's constant.

393
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:17,903
And Boltzman's constant has units of

394
00:18:17,903 --> 00:18:19,929
energy over temperature.

395
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:25,981
But this wasn't actually understood until

396
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:26,989
the 1950s.

397
00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:29,002
No one really figured that this out.

398
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:32,005
There was this relation until the 1950s.

399
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:34,007
And when it was figured out, it was

400
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,009
figured out by a guy named Jean Carlo

401
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:37,010
Wick.

402
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,013
And he introduced this notion of the Wick

403
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:44,017
rotation by realizing that if you have an

404
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:47,020
equation in classical physics, and in it,

405
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,022
there's the term one over KT.

406
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:53,026
You can always replace that one over KT

407
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:55,028
with this other expression.

408
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:57,030
It over h bar.

409
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,032
H bar is just h divided by two pi, and

410
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:02,029
you'll get an equation that's valid in

411
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:03,030
quantum theory.

412
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,033
And this is typically described in

413
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,034
textbooks as a trick.

414
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:10,037
And whenever something in physics is

415
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:12,039
described as a trick, what that really

416
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,040
means is it's something we don't

417
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,041
understand.

418
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:18,045
And lots of papers have been written

419
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:21,048
about the meaning of the WIC rotation.

420
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:25,052
But to start to understand the WIC

421
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:28,055
rotation, I want to look at this equation

422
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:29,056
a little bit.

423
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:37,064
One over KT is one over in energy, and it

424
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:43,070
over h bar is one over in energy.

425
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,073
Since h bar is units of energy times time,

426
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:50,077
, we have time in this equation, and then

427
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:53,079
we have this factor, I, which is

428
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,083
typically thought of as just an imaginary

429
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,084
number.

430
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:59,086
So it's the square root of minus one.

431
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:02,083
And what's this I doing in this

432
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,084
equation?

433
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:06,087
And in fact, you see factors of it over h

434
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:06,087
bar.

435
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:09,090
If you're familiar with quantum theory

436
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,092
everywhere in quantum theory.

437
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:15,096
So what's the meaning of this imaginary

438
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:16,097
number?

439
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:20,101
And if you just think of it or of I as

440
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:23,104
this arbitrary imaginary number that

441
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:26,107
somehow renders the equation mysterious,

442
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:29,110
then the whole of quantum theory is

443
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,114
mysterious, but the Wick rotation is very

444
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:34,115
mysterious.

445
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:38,119
But what I is actually is an operator.

446
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,124
And if you think of the real numbers as

447
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:45,126
an axis, which is always drawn

448
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:46,127
horizontally.

449
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,129
So here it is.

450
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:51,132
Here's zero, and the axis is pointing

451
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:52,133
that way.

452
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,135
I'm sorry, I can't get the camera really

453
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:56,137
far enough away to see my arm here.

454
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,139
So what is I?

455
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:01,136
I is actually an operator that rotates

456
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:05,140
the whole real axis by 90 degrees.

457
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,143
So if you see a plot of complex numbers,

458
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,145
then the real numbers go this way, and

459
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,147
the, quote, imaginary numbers go that way.

460
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:12,147
.

461
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:15,150
So what multiplying by I has done is

462
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,152
rotate by 90 degrees.

463
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,154
And of course, if you do I squared, you

464
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:22,157
rotate twice by 90 degrees by arm would

465
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,159
do this, but you end up pointing that way,

466
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,161
, and those are the negative numbers.

467
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:29,164
So I is an operator that rotates

468
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:32,167
something by 90 degrees, and if you

469
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:35,170
rotate four times by 90 degrees, you're

470
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,172
back to the identity.

471
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:39,174
So I to the fourth is one.

472
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:43,177
So this tells us something very

473
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,180
interesting, which is that what the WIC

474
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,183
rotation is really talking about is a

475
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:48,183
rotation.

476
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,187
It's a geometrical equation.

477
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:57,192
And in July, we'll come back to this and

478
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:00,189
really probe what this Wick rotation

479
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:02,191
means physically.

480
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:08,197
But as I said, this wasn't understood to

481
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:11,200
the 1950s, and by the 1950s, a lot had

482
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,201
happened.

483
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:14,203
So quantum theory had been developed.

484
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,205
Bohren Einstein had had their debate.

485
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:18,207
Particle accelerators had been built.

486
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:20,209
The atomic bomb had been built.

487
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:24,213
Nuclear physics was well in its way, so

488
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:28,217
an enormous amount of practical physics

489
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:29,218
had been done.

490
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:31,220
Quantum theory was highly developed.

491
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,223
People were starting to think about

492
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:36,225
quantum field theory before they made

493
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:38,227
this simple realization that's formulated

494
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:40,229
in the Wick rotation.

495
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:43,232
So this is a harboring of things to come.

496
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:43,232
.

497
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:46,235
But before we continue in physics, we

498
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:48,237
need to backtrack in time a little bit

499
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:51,240
and look at what the mathematicians were

500
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,241
doing.

501
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:56,245
So across the hall in the math department,

502
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:59,248
, one year after the Solve conference in

503
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:03,246
1929, kurt Godel proved his famous first

504
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:05,248
incompleteness theorem.

505
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:07,250
And the theorem states that no formal

506
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,252
system that contains arithmetic can be

507
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:11,254
both consistent and complete.

508
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:15,258
And that means that either there are true

509
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:18,261
statements that aren't provable in the

510
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:21,264
formal system, or there are false

511
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:24,267
statements that are provable, or, of

512
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:25,268
course, both.

513
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:31,273
And Godel's proof is actually extremely

514
00:23:31,273 --> 00:23:31,274
simple.

515
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:35,278
Almost all of the work in the proof is

516
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:38,281
setting up all of the notation and

517
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:41,284
procedures and so forth to formulate

518
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:45,288
within arithmetic the sentence, this

519
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:48,290
sentence is not provable.

520
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:51,294
And once you have that sentence

521
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:54,297
formulated within arithmetic, then the

522
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:56,299
conclusion of the proof is obvious.

523
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,302
If you can prove the sentence, this

524
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:01,298
sentence is not provable, then you've

525
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:03,300
proved something that's false.

526
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:07,304
And if you can't prove it, then there are

527
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:09,306
sentences that you can't prove in

528
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:10,307
arithmetic.

529
00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:13,310
So this was incredibly bad news for

530
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,313
mathematicians who thought that finite

531
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:18,315
discrete operations, which is what proofs

532
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:21,318
are and also what computations are, can

533
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:24,321
exhaustively enumerate the facts and this

534
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:27,324
was the assumption behind Wittgenstein's

535
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:30,327
claim that the world is all that is the

536
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:33,330
case, the world is a collection of facts.

537
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:33,330
.

538
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,333
And optimistically, he thought that first

539
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,336
order logic would allow us to enumerate

540
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:41,338
all those facts and we'd be done dreams

541
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:43,340
of a final theory again.

542
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:48,345
So Godel's Theorem means that no system

543
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:51,348
with finite capabilities, no system that

544
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:54,351
can just do finite discrete operations,

545
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:56,353
can fully describe its environment.

546
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:59,356
It will always be in an environment where

547
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:01,352
there are true things that aren't

548
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:03,354
provable or false things that are

549
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:03,354
provable.

550
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:07,358
But I think more relative to a discussion

551
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:10,361
of agents is that it means that no agent

552
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:12,363
can describe itself.

553
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:15,366
Any agent's theory of itself will either

554
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:18,369
contain true statements that it can't

555
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:21,372
derive or false statements, or it will

556
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:23,374
either miss true statements that it can't

557
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:26,377
derive or wind up deriving things that

558
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:28,379
are false about itself.

559
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,382
Of course, we see this in psychology all

560
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:32,383
the time.

561
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:35,386
So an immediate consequence of Godel's

562
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:38,389
Theorem was an intense investigation of

563
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,391
what computation actually is, what it

564
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:43,394
meant to talk about finite discrete

565
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:44,395
operations.

566
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:47,398
And two leaders of this were, of course,

567
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:48,399
Church and Turing.

568
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:51,402
And here's a picture of a Turing machine,

569
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:53,404
which is just a little device with a

570
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,406
couple of tapes and a tape reader and a

571
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,408
simple logic unit that either writes a

572
00:25:57,408 --> 00:26:00,405
one or a zero if it sees a one or a zero.

573
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:00,405
.

574
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:03,408
And they defined a computation as a

575
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:06,411
process that can be implemented in finite

576
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:09,414
time by such a machine or by Church's

577
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:11,416
lambda calculus or by any of the now

578
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:14,419
hundreds of other methods that are

579
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:17,422
provably equivalent to a Turing machine.

580
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:19,424
So what does this mean?

581
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:22,427
It means that computation is a physical

582
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:25,430
process that can be mechanized and it

583
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,432
turns out, mechanized in any one of a

584
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:29,434
huge array of ways.

585
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:31,436
It means that many different

586
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:34,439
implementations of any computation are

587
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
possible.

588
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:37,442
So I can do it on a Turing machine, I can

589
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:39,444
do it on my laptop, I can do it on my

590
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:40,445
head, et cetera.

591
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:43,448
The most important things it means is

592
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:44,449
that there are questions with no

593
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:45,450
computable answer.

594
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,453
This is the Revenge of Godel's theorem.

595
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:50,455
And two of the most famous questions of

596
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:53,458
this kind are given some arbitrary

597
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:53,458
program.

598
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,459
Will it halt?

599
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:57,462
Will it get to an answer in finite time?

600
00:26:57,462 --> 00:27:01,460
And the answer to that question is this

601
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,461
is undecidable.

602
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:05,464
No procedure can figure this out.

603
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:09,468
And the other undecidable question is,

604
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:12,471
given some arbitrary program, what

605
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:14,473
function does it compute?

606
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:17,476
And you'd think that would be simple,

607
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:19,478
that you can read a program and figure

608
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:20,479
out what function it computes.

609
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:23,482
But it turns out that is undecidable.

610
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:27,486
That cannot be done by any finite process.

611
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:27,486
.

612
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:33,492
So this was another body blow to the goal

613
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:37,496
of understanding everything with finite

614
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:39,498
discrete processes.

615
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:43,501
But it also set the stage for something

616
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:43,502
new.

617
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:46,505
It set the stage for thinking about an

618
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:49,508
agent who interacts with a computational

619
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:53,512
process by giving it an input and then

620
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:56,515
looking at its output sometime later.

621
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:00,513
And this, of course, will look familiar

622
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,515
because I've included the blue ellipse,

623
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,517
which is the boundary, which these days

624
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,519
we call a user interface.

625
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,523
And the user interface just allows some

626
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,526
finite action on the system and then the

627
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,529
ability to observe some finite response

628
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:17,530
by the system.

629
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,533
So we can now ask what can Alice

630
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,536
determine by acting in some finite way

631
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,539
and then making some finite number of

632
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,540
observations I.

633
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,541
E.

634
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,544
Receiving some finite number of outputs

635
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,546
from the system that she's acting on.

636
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,551
And the first 20 years of this produced a

637
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,554
large number of answers, all of them

638
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:42,555
negative.

639
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,558
So to go back to Turing, he proved that

640
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,561
Alice can't tell what's implementing the

641
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,563
function that she sees being implemented.

642
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:51,564
.

643
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:55,568
She can't tell whether a given input will

644
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,569
lead to an output.

645
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,571
That's the halting problem.

646
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:03,570
Shannon showed that Alice can't tell what

647
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,572
the inputs mean to the system.

648
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:08,575
His whole theory of communication is

649
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:11,578
completely independent of semantics.

650
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:14,581
And his theory of communication actually

651
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:17,584
accurately describes what Alice can

652
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:18,585
observe.

653
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:24,591
Rice is the one who proved that you can't

654
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:28,595
determine what program is generating the

655
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:29,596
outputs.

656
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:31,598
And then Moore proved a very similar

657
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:34,601
result in a completely different formal

658
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,603
setting of general cybernetics that you

659
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:38,605
can't tell what process is generating the

660
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:40,607
outputs by finite observation.

661
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:44,611
But what Alice can do is build a

662
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:47,614
predictive model of what generates the

663
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:50,617
output she sees in response to her inputs

664
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:53,620
and test it by designing new inputs.

665
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:57,624
And this is, of course, as Karl Popper

666
00:29:57,624 --> 00:30:00,621
told us, the process that we call science.

667
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:00,621
.

668
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:03,624
So Alice can do science even though she

669
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:06,627
can't answer any of these fundamental

670
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:07,628
questions.

671
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:13,634
Now, this, of course, has a huge

672
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:17,638
technological consequence since this

673
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:20,641
theory of computation tells us that

674
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:24,645
processes are effectively virtual.

675
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:28,649
We don't know what they are and we can't

676
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:31,652
determine what they are except in theory.

677
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:31,652
.

678
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:34,655
By making a theory technologically, it

679
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:37,658
means we're free to use virtualization

680
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:40,661
everywhere because we have to deal with

681
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:41,662
it anyway.

682
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:44,665
And this allows us to build multilevel

683
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:45,666
architectures.

684
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:48,669
It means that we can architect computers

685
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:51,672
where no layer of the computation has any

686
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:54,675
idea what's going on below or above it

687
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:55,676
and doesn't need to.

688
00:30:57,678 --> 00:30:59,680
And that's what makes practical

689
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,675
programming possible.

690
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:04,679
So from these no go theorems that tell

691
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,683
you what you can't do, you actually get

692
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:12,687
an enormous boost into it and use to

693
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:16,691
probe the world and develop theories and

694
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:18,693
on and on and on.

695
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:23,698
So in a sense, Godel birthed not only

696
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:26,701
computer science, but practical computing

697
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:29,704
by showing us that virtualization is just

698
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:31,706
the way the world works.

699
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:35,710
So now let's go back to physics where

700
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,714
these ideas were replicated, basically

701
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:42,717
reintroduced, reinvented by Feynman in

702
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:46,721
developing his path integral formulation

703
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,723
of quantum theory.

704
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:52,727
And basically what Feyman realized was

705
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:55,730
that in any physical process, the

706
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,734
observer Alice prepares some state that

707
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:01,730
she's interested in.

708
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,733
She prepares some input to an experiment.

709
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:04,733
.

710
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:08,737
Then she lets something happen, and then

711
00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:10,739
she sees what the result of the

712
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:12,741
experiment is.

713
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:15,744
And the canonical experiment in physics

714
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:16,745
is scattering.

715
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:18,747
You fire two protons at each other, and

716
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:21,750
they intersect someplace, and stuff comes

717
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,752
out, and you measure the stuff that comes

718
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:24,753
out.

719
00:32:24,753 --> 00:32:28,757
And what you can measure is momentum and

720
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:32,761
spin energy, things like that position.

721
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:37,766
So these processes conserve the total

722
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:41,770
values of the things you can measure.

723
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,773
So in particular, they preserve momentum

724
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:47,776
and angular momentum, and they preserve

725
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:50,779
other things that are harder to measure

726
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:52,781
and are only approximately conserved

727
00:32:52,781 --> 00:32:54,783
anyway, like Lepton number.

728
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:58,787
But Feynman's contribution to this way of

729
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:01,784
thinking about experiments was to say,

730
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:04,787
look, if you want to understand the

731
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:07,790
output, you have to sum over all of the

732
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,793
possible processes that could have

733
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:13,796
produced the output from the input, no

734
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:16,799
matter how improbable they are.

735
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,802
So the famous idea from Feynman diagrams

736
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:21,804
is if you have an electron that's

737
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:24,807
scattering off an atom, you measure the

738
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:27,810
initial state of the electron that you've

739
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,812
generated with an accelerator or

740
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:32,815
something, and you measure the final

741
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:34,817
state, which involves momentum and spin

742
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:36,819
and so forth.

743
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:40,823
And for all you knew, partway through the

744
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:44,827
process, the electron disappeared, and an

745
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:47,830
entire universe appeared and then

746
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,833
annihilated with a copy of an entire anti

747
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:54,837
universe, and the electron came back out.

748
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:55,838
.

749
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:57,840
And you have to include processes like

750
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,837
that if you really want to understand and

751
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:02,839
correctly predict the outcomes of your

752
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:03,840
measurements.

753
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:07,844
And Murray Gelman lifted the bumper

754
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:10,847
sticker slogan from Th White and the once

755
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:14,851
and Future King everything not explicitly

756
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:16,853
forbidden is mandatory.

757
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:18,855
That sums up Feynman's idea.

758
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:22,859
And this is called the totalitarian

759
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,862
principle, since it's what's written in

760
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:27,864
Th White's book on the kingdom of the

761
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:30,867
ants, for which everything not explicitly

762
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:32,869
forbidden is mandatory.

763
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,873
So let's think about a real example that'

764
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:39,876
's a bit actually, it's the same as

765
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:40,876
scattering.

766
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:43,880
The ultimate scattering experiment in

767
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,882
physics is a black hole.

768
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:50,887
Stuff goes into the horizon, stars, whole

769
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:51,888
galaxies, whatever.

770
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:56,893
Something happens, and stuff comes out.

771
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:59,896
And what comes out is Hawking radiation,

772
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:02,893
and information is conserved if the

773
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,896
information in the Hawking radiation is

774
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,899
actually the same as the information in

775
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,901
the stuff that went in.

776
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:15,906
And conservation is not qualitative.

777
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:16,907
It's quantitative.

778
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,910
It's only the quantity of information

779
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,912
that's supposed to be preserved.

780
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:24,915
And you can ask, how much is the

781
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,917
information that's being emitted by a

782
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,920
black hole that's emitting Hawking

783
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,921
radiation?

784
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,924
And Beckenstein was the one who figured

785
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,927
this out, using an incredibly simple

786
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:37,928
argument.

787
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,931
But I'll just give the answer here.

788
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,934
The answer is that the total entropy of

789
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,937
the black hole is its area divided by

790
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,940
four, and the area in this equation has

791
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,943
to be computed in Planck units, which are

792
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,946
units where Planck's constant and the

793
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,949
speed of light and boltzman's constant

794
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:01,946
and other interesting things are all set

795
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:02,947
equal to one.

796
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:07,952
So one Planck area is the Planck length

797
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:10,955
squared, which turns out to be about ten

798
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:12,957
to the minus squared.

799
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:16,961
So this is that black holes are the most

800
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:18,963
entropic entities we know of.

801
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:22,967
So a black hole about this big with a

802
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:27,972
radius of about a meter has an entropy of

803
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:30,975
about ten to the 70th, which is, of

804
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:35,980
course, an astonishingly big number, and

805
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,984
a black hole with the area of the sun.

806
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:42,987
So a moderate sized cosmological black

807
00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:45,990
hole, a real thing that we can observe

808
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,993
with a gravity wave telescope or

809
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:51,996
something, has an entropy of about ten to

810
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:52,997
the 79th.

811
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:56,001
And really big black holes, which are

812
00:36:56,001 --> 00:37:00,999
bigger than the entire solar system, have

813
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:04,003
entropies into the ten to the something.

814
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:08,007
So these are enormously entropic entities.

815
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:08,007
.

816
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:13,012
But Beckenstein didn't just tell us that.

817
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:13,012
.

818
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:17,016
He told us something about the structure

819
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:20,019
of the interface, the horizon of a black

820
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:20,019
hole.

821
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,022
And this is what he told us.

822
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:30,029
You can compute entropy in bits just by

823
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:34,033
using logs, base two instead of logs

824
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:36,035
based e, natural logs.

825
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:41,040
And that's just multiplying the natural

826
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,042
log by about 1.4.

827
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:48,047
So we can write the entropy of black hole,

828
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:51,050
, of black hole in units of bits, and it'

829
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,051
's about a over six.

830
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:57,055
So what does this mean to say that we can

831
00:37:57,055 --> 00:38:00,053
think of the entropy in terms of bits?

832
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:05,058
What it says is that we can think of the

833
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:10,063
interface in terms of a bit array, and we

834
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:15,068
can think of all of these bits as encoded

835
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:21,074
on this interface at a density of one bit

836
00:38:21,074 --> 00:38:26,079
every roughly six plank lengths squared,

837
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,081
six plank areas.

838
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:31,084
So this is an incredibly dense encoding

839
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:32,085
in a black hole.

840
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:36,089
And it's an interesting idea about black

841
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:37,089
holes.

842
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,092
But what gets really interesting is what

843
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:41,094
happens when you generalize it.

844
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:44,097
And of course, physicists are prone to

845
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:46,099
generalization, and that's what happened

846
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,100
next.

847
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:52,105
Gerard to Hooft, almost immediately

848
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:54,107
thereafter, on the basis of Beckenstein's

849
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:56,109
work, formulated the Holographic

850
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:57,110
principle.

851
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,107
And what the Holographic principle says

852
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:03,110
is we can think of any system as

853
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,113
approximately a black hole.

854
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:09,116
And the only approximation is the

855
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:10,117
encoding density.

856
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:14,121
The boundary of any system encodes the

857
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:18,125
information that we can get about the

858
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:21,128
system at some density.

859
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:23,130
And the density is less than the density

860
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,132
for a black hole because we're not black

861
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:26,133
holes.

862
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:30,137
And this rules out a lot by limiting the

863
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:32,139
amount of information that you can

864
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:35,142
extract from a system to the amount of

865
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:37,144
information that you can actually write

866
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:39,146
on its boundary.

867
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:42,149
And one of the things that it rules out

868
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:44,151
is knowing the geometry on the inside of

869
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,152
the system.

870
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,154
And to Hoof put it this way, which I

871
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:50,157
think is a brilliant thought experiment,

872
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:53,159
he says, look, the metric inside this

873
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,162
system can be so curved, effectively the

874
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:58,165
space time inside the system can be so

875
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:00,161
curved that you could stick an entire

876
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:02,163
universe inside.

877
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:04,165
And we never know because it wouldn't

878
00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:07,168
change the amount of entropy number of

879
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,170
bits that are encoded on the boundary.

880
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:13,174
So the inside geometry can be anything.

881
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:15,176
And you can't find out by.

882
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:17,178
Looking at the outside of the system.

883
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:21,182
Now, the Holographic principle almost

884
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:24,184
follows from classical physics.

885
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:29,190
There's Euler's theorem, which tells you

886
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:33,194
about one over R squared forces, and you

887
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:37,198
can think of the force as penetrating the

888
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:40,201
boundary at some density.

889
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:43,204
And the difference between Euler's

890
00:40:43,204 --> 00:40:46,207
theorem and the Holographic principle is

891
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:49,210
just that the density in classical

892
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,212
physics can go to infinity.

893
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:55,216
And in the Holographic principle, it can

894
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:58,219
only go to this maximal density that's

895
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:00,215
achieved by a black hole.

896
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:01,216
Why?

897
00:41:01,216 --> 00:41:03,218
Because if you try to get any higher,

898
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:05,220
more information, the information gets

899
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,223
sucked into the black hole, and you can't

900
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:09,224
get it out.

901
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:14,229
So the Holographic principle becomes a

902
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:17,232
guiding principle for thinking about any

903
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:20,235
physical system and what it means to

904
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:23,238
extract information from a physical

905
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:24,239
system.

906
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,243
And in fact, we'll talk about this next

907
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
time.

908
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:32,247
You can say exactly what the information

909
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:34,249
encoded on the boundary of any system is.

910
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:35,250
.

911
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:39,254
And what I'll go through next time is

912
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:41,256
seeing that the information that's

913
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:44,258
encoded on the boundary is a

914
00:41:44,258 --> 00:41:46,261
specification of the energy that's being

915
00:41:46,261 --> 00:41:49,264
exchanged by the interaction, which, of

916
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:53,268
course, is linear in the number of bits.

917
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:55,270
It's just counting the number of bits.

918
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:57,272
Okay?

919
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:01,270
So with the Holographic principle, we now

920
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,274
have a complete new science about systems

921
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:08,277
that are exchanging finite discrete

922
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:12,281
information across a boundary by encoding

923
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:15,284
that information on the boundary and then

924
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:19,288
reading the information off the boundary.

925
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:19,288
.

926
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:23,292
So here's a new way of thinking about

927
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:25,294
physical interaction.

928
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:29,298
Alice writes a message on her boundary

929
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:32,301
with Bob, and Bob reads the message off

930
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:35,304
the boundary and then writes his own new

931
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:38,307
message, which Alice then reads.

932
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:41,310
And of course, that's what's happening

933
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,311
right now.

934
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:46,315
I'm writing information by speaking on an

935
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:49,318
interface, which is effectively the

936
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:50,319
Internet.

937
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,322
And you're reading that information off

938
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:56,325
the Internet by listening to it.

939
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:59,328
And when we get time for questions, you'

940
00:42:59,328 --> 00:43:01,324
'll be writing information on the

941
00:43:01,324 --> 00:43:04,327
Internet, which I'll be reading.

942
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:07,330
Now, the key thing about this new science

943
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,332
is that it's topological.

944
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:12,335
It's about connectivity across some

945
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:15,338
communication channel, which we represent

946
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:16,339
as a boundary.

947
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,343
It's not geometric, so it doesn't assume

948
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:22,345
anything about spacetime.

949
00:43:24,347 --> 00:43:28,351
So it allows us to build a model of space

950
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:33,355
in particular as an emergent phenomenon.

951
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:37,360
And it allows us to see time as not some

952
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,363
absolute external abstraction, but

953
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:44,367
something that the communicating agents

954
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:47,370
measure for themselves.

955
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:51,374
And so they each act in their own time.

956
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:56,379
And we get a very natural measure of time

957
00:43:56,379 --> 00:43:59,382
in terms of how many bits I see coming

958
00:43:59,382 --> 00:44:00,377
across my boundary.

959
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:03,380
And again, we'll talk about that in the

960
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,383
next couple of sessions and then talk

961
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:08,385
about it more thoroughly in September

962
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:11,388
when we talk about emergent spacetime.

963
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:15,392
So quantum information theory looks very

964
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:18,395
different from the physics that came

965
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:21,398
before, not because it's adopted a new

966
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:24,401
formalism, the tools of quantum theory.

967
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:27,404
It's because it's entirely changed the

968
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:30,407
thinking about what physics is and what

969
00:44:30,407 --> 00:44:33,410
it's about and replace this idea of

970
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:36,413
forces and balls banging into each other

971
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:39,416
and all of that with the idea of

972
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:41,418
communication between agents.

973
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:45,422
And of course that's familiar from an

974
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:47,424
active inference perspective.

975
00:44:47,424 --> 00:44:51,427
So we can now back up a little bit to see

976
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:54,431
what they were doing in classical physics

977
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:55,432
during this period.

978
00:44:55,432 --> 00:44:57,434
Well, let me go on a little bit.

979
00:44:57,434 --> 00:44:58,435
Sorry.

980
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:05,436
This is just a slide quoting Wheeler, who

981
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:09,440
of course is the most radical in terms of

982
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,444
impitheist, in terms of formulating these

983
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,445
ideas.

984
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,448
But here's his characterization of this

985
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,449
new physics.

986
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,451
It's not reductive.

987
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,454
All of the reasoning is circular.

988
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,458
You don't have smaller things and then

989
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,461
yet smaller things, and then yet smaller

990
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:31,462
things forever.

991
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,465
There are no laws.

992
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:40,471
So what you see on the interface is a

993
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,472
message.

994
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,474
It's not something that's governed by

995
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:47,477
laws since the beginning of the universe.

996
00:45:47,477 --> 00:45:47,478
.

997
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,480
There's no continuum.

998
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,482
So there's nothing described by real

999
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:52,482
numbers.

1000
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,484
It's all described by integers.

1001
00:45:54,484 --> 00:45:56,487
Everything's done in finite dimensional

1002
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:56,487
spaces.

1003
00:45:57,487 --> 00:45:59,490
And finally, and most importantly, there'

1004
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,486
's no spacetime box in which things

1005
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:02,487
happen.

1006
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:06,491
So think of how radical this is means.

1007
00:46:06,491 --> 00:46:10,495
There's no big bang, there's no big rip,

1008
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:13,498
there's no bouncing universe.

1009
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:16,501
All of those ideas are out the window

1010
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:18,503
because they're classical and they're

1011
00:46:18,503 --> 00:46:19,504
about spacetime.

1012
00:46:19,504 --> 00:46:23,508
And what the new physics wants to do is

1013
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:26,511
derive spacetime out of basically users

1014
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:27,512
experiences.

1015
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:32,517
So the agents here are all observer

1016
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:36,521
participants in Wheeler's language.

1017
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:38,523
But what that just means is agents that

1018
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:41,526
want to communicate and it's their

1019
00:46:41,526 --> 00:46:44,529
communication that gives rise to physics.

1020
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:44,529
.

1021
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,533
So now we'll go back to classical physics

1022
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:51,536
and what was happening, or one thing that

1023
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:54,539
was happening in classical physics at

1024
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:56,541
that time was a lot of thinking about

1025
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,543
stochastic causal networks.

1026
00:46:59,544 --> 00:47:03,542
And Pearl realized that if you have any

1027
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:06,545
stochastic causal network that's

1028
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:10,549
unidirectional, then around any node, you

1029
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:14,553
can draw what he called a Markov blanket.

1030
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:15,554
.

1031
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:18,557
And a Markov blanket is just the set of

1032
00:47:18,557 --> 00:47:21,560
nodes in the network that absorb all

1033
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,563
outside causation and then transmit that

1034
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:26,565
causation into whatever node you're

1035
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:29,568
interested in and then absorb all

1036
00:47:29,568 --> 00:47:32,571
causation coming from the node you're

1037
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:35,574
interested in and transmit it to the rest

1038
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:37,576
of the world.

1039
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:41,580
And so we can redraw that in Part B here,

1040
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,583
and it should look very familiar.

1041
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:46,585
A Markov blanket is just a classical

1042
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:48,587
physics way of talking about a

1043
00:47:48,587 --> 00:47:49,588
Holographic screen.

1044
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:53,592
And the number of nodes in the Markov

1045
00:47:53,592 --> 00:47:56,595
blanket, or in particular the number of

1046
00:47:56,595 --> 00:47:59,598
degrees of freedom times the number of

1047
00:47:59,598 --> 00:48:02,595
nodes, is just the number of bits that

1048
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:04,597
flow across that Markov blanket.

1049
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:07,600
So it's the entropy of the effective

1050
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,602
Holographic screen.

1051
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:15,608
All these ideas were reinvented more or

1052
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:17,610
less independently within classical

1053
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:18,611
physics.

1054
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:22,615
And it was from this classical physics

1055
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:25,618
background that Karl Freston came up with

1056
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:28,621
the idea that a Markov blanket defines a

1057
00:48:28,621 --> 00:48:31,624
persistence, at least from an active

1058
00:48:31,624 --> 00:48:34,627
inference institute point of view

1059
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:37,630
everyone is familiar with, because it's

1060
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,633
the foundation of the idea of active

1061
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:41,634
inference.

1062
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:48,641
Any system that persists through time

1063
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:52,645
does so by making sure that it doesn't

1064
00:48:52,645 --> 00:48:56,649
dissolve into its environment.

1065
00:48:56,649 --> 00:48:58,651
Well, what does that mean?

1066
00:48:58,651 --> 00:49:01,648
It means it persists through time by

1067
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,650
maintaining the integrity of its Markov

1068
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,653
blanket or the integrity of its boundary.

1069
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:07,654
.

1070
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:10,657
So this of course is just a tautology,

1071
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:13,660
but it's a very interesting and very

1072
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,663
productive tautology because it says that

1073
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,666
any system is using the information it

1074
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:23,670
gets on its boundary from its environment

1075
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,673
to build a model of how its environment

1076
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:27,674
behaves.

1077
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:31,678
And then it uses that model to act back

1078
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:34,681
on its environment to test and refine its

1079
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:35,682
model.

1080
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:38,685
And again, as Popper told us, this is

1081
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:40,687
just what science is.

1082
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:43,690
So what the free energy principle really

1083
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,693
tells us is that all systems are agents

1084
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:49,696
that are doing science all the time.

1085
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:54,701
So physics is effectively not just the

1086
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:57,704
study of communication, but it's the

1087
00:49:57,704 --> 00:50:01,702
study of agents doing science with each

1088
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:05,706
other, pairs of agents who are trying to

1089
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:08,709
figure each other out by their

1090
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:11,712
communicative exchanges.

1091
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:16,717
So that's the history of how we got from

1092
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:20,721
1930s sorry, 1850s thermodynamics to the

1093
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:25,726
free energy principle and how the free

1094
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:29,730
energy principle connects to these very

1095
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:33,734
deep and extremely radical, especially

1096
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:37,738
within context ideas in quantum theory

1097
00:50:37,738 --> 00:50:41,742
and quantum cosmology and computer

1098
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:43,743
science.

1099
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:47,748
All of which tell us that the world we

1100
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:52,753
see is a projection that's being written

1101
00:50:52,753 --> 00:50:56,757
on our boundaries by a process that we

1102
00:50:56,757 --> 00:51:00,755
have no access to except the procedure of

1103
00:51:00,755 --> 00:51:04,759
active inference or the procedure of

1104
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:09,764
science, which is to formulate predictive

1105
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:13,768
models and test them by doing things in

1106
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:17,772
the world and seeing how the world

1107
00:51:17,772 --> 00:51:19,774
responds.

1108
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:25,780
So that's it for this session.

1109
00:51:27,782 --> 00:51:30,785
The first discussion session which Andrew

1110
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:33,788
is going to lead will be the 3 June at

1111
00:51:33,788 --> 00:51:37,792
this same time, I E 05:00 European time.

1112
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:42,796
And then my session number two will be in

1113
00:51:42,796 --> 00:51:42,797
mid June.

1114
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:46,801
And if you look at the course website,

1115
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:50,804
there's this subsidiary website for

1116
00:51:50,804 --> 00:51:51,806
interactive Q and A.

1117
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:55,810
And I invite everyone to post questions

1118
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:59,814
and discuss them and hope that we'll have

1119
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:03,812
an interesting exchange and that everyone

1120
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:07,816
will come to sort of an understanding of

1121
00:52:07,816 --> 00:52:10,819
what was talked about today through

1122
00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:12,821
discussion.

1123
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:16,825
And we'll be interested in being back in

1124
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:19,828
June to see how to formulate this in

1125
00:52:19,828 --> 00:52:20,829
quantum theory.

1126
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:23,832
So thank you very much and thank you

1127
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:25,834
again, Daniel, for organizing this and

1128
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:28,837
hosting it and putting together all the

1129
00:52:28,837 --> 00:52:30,839
technical things necessary to pull this

1130
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:31,840
off.

1131
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,842
I could never do that on my own.

1132
00:52:35,844 --> 00:52:35,844
Daniel: Thank you.

1133
00:52:35,844 --> 00:52:38,847
We're really excited here.

1134
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:40,849
Any closing thoughts?

1135
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:43,852
Or andrew, I'd love to hear your

1136
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:45,854
reflection just briefly.

1137
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:48,857
How would you have told that history or

1138
00:52:48,857 --> 00:52:50,859
how does that history reflect on the

1139
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:52,861
areas that you're familiar with?

1140
00:52:54,863 --> 00:52:56,865
Ander: Well, I don't think I have much to

1141
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:56,865
add.

1142
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:01,864
I've been mainly interested in the weak

1143
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:03,866
rotation part.

1144
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:06,869
I'm excited to hear more about that,

1145
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:07,870
Chris.

1146
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:11,874
But no, I found this to be a very nice

1147
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:12,875
summary.

1148
00:53:13,876 --> 00:53:15,878
I'm less familiar with the staff on

1149
00:53:15,878 --> 00:53:18,881
computation, formal computation, despite

1150
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:21,884
being a mathematician by training, it was

1151
00:53:21,884 --> 00:53:24,887
a little more familiar with all the

1152
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:27,890
physics stuff, but yeah, I thought it was

1153
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:28,891
great.

1154
00:53:29,892 --> 00:53:30,893
Chris: Thank you.

1155
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:31,894
All right.

1156
00:53:31,894 --> 00:53:32,895
Daniel: Thank you.

1157
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:33,896
I will close it.

1158
00:53:33,896 --> 00:53:35,898
So in about two weeks, we'll have the

1159
00:53:35,898 --> 00:53:36,899
first discussion.

1160
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:38,901
Everyone's welcome to join.

1161
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:40,903
I will share with Honor and Chris the

1162
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:42,905
questions, and we can develop that.

1163
00:53:43,905 --> 00:53:45,908
And we'll have that on the course, front

1164
00:53:45,908 --> 00:53:47,910
end before the coming discussion.

1165
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:49,912
So thanks again, fellows.

1166
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:50,913
See you next time.

1167
00:53:50,913 --> 00:53:51,914
Chris: Bye.
