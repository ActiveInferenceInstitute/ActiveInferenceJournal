00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,968
Hello and welcome,

2
00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:08,644
everyone, to the active inference

3
00:00:08,692 --> 00:00:11,944
institute. This is session one of the

4
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:14,500
course physics as Information Processing

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,240
with Chris Fields. First we'll have

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,316
Ander Aguirre and Chris Fields.

7
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:21,412
Introduce themselves. And then we'll

8
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:24,152
carry on with the first lecture. Here.

9
00:00:24,286 --> 00:00:26,936
Check out the video description for a

10
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,972
link to the course course overview

11
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:32,256
website where you can ask questions that

12
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:34,924
will be answered asynchronously register

13
00:00:34,972 --> 00:00:36,956
to participate in the discussions,

14
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:39,536
which happen about two weeks after each

15
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:42,244
of the six lecture sessions and just

16
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:45,300
learn more about this area. So thank you

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,580
both so much for joining into this

18
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,748
adventure. We are starting now. And

19
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:53,988
first, please, Ander Aguirre, introduce

20
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:56,132
yourself. And then Chris introduction

21
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:58,010
and lecture. Thank you.

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,200
Hello. So I'll be the course assistant.

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,809
I'm a postdoc in math, specializing in

24
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:08,536
improbability, and I have a deep

25
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,270
interest in the physics of information.

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,016
And I've been familiar with Chris's

27
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:15,276
papers for a while. So, yeah, just here

28
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:16,190
to learn myself.

29
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,992
Thank you, Andrew. And thank you,

30
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:27,934
Daniel. I'm Chris Fields and

31
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:31,470
I'll be presenting this course in six

32
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,946
sessions and Aguirre will

33
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:38,290
be organizing discussion sessions after

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,538
each of those. And all of this is

35
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:43,380
explained on the course website.

36
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,040
So let's start.

37
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,174
This is a course on physics as

38
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:54,582
information processing, and this first

39
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:58,890
session will be historical perspective

40
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,882
on the idea that physics is

41
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:06,810
or is about information processing.

42
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,562
And I'll just start with a few

43
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:12,046
quotations that span the middle of the

44
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:15,086
20th century from Wittgenstein in

45
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,966
1920s saying the world is all that is

46
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:20,382
the case. So defining the world in terms

47
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:23,490
of facts, not objects.

48
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,454
Landauer in the early 60s proclaiming

49
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:29,410
that information is physical.

50
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,162
And then John Archibald Wheeler, who in

51
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:36,454
many ways is the grandfather of this

52
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:40,674
era, recently stating

53
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:44,646
it is it from Bit. So things

54
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,850
come from information, I E bitstrings.

55
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,122
And if nothing else, this shows that

56
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,954
formulations of this idea get pithier as

57
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:57,180
the 20th century rolls on.

58
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,698
But the history goes back

59
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,390
farther clearly than the 20th century.

60
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,494
But I'm only going to really talk about

61
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:13,154
a piece of it and the

62
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,220
timeline that I'll actually discuss

63
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,562
today. The most relevant history of this

64
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:23,090
idea goes back to the mid 19th century.

65
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,006
And the first specific thing

66
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:30,562
I'll talk about is Clausia's definition

67
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:34,326
of entropy. But with the beginning of

68
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,954
the understanding of thermodynamics and

69
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:38,586
the role of information in

70
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:41,626
thermodynamics, you get this very

71
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:44,406
interesting multidisciplinary

72
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:47,754
progression of ideas that

73
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:49,994
incorporates the beginning of quantum

74
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:50,750
theory.

75
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,014
And the beginning of quantum theory can

76
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:59,162
kind of be dated to the first Solve

77
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:02,722
conference in 1928 and the

78
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,490
famous debate between Bohr and Einstein

79
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,594
over whether quantum theory is about

80
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:12,222
knowledge, information or objects

81
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:16,338
things. But it incorporates

82
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:19,574
a lot of work in computer science and

83
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:21,622
logic and mathematics. So,

84
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:25,378
interestingly, computer science was Born

85
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:29,114
effectively in the mid 30s with the work

86
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:32,710
of Church and Turing, which very rapidly

87
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,658
converged with the work in physics. So

88
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:37,498
today we'll be talking about both

89
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:39,530
computer science and physics.

90
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,354
And then in the second half of the 20th

91
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:46,158
century, this just exploded into a huge

92
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:50,554
area. And in consequence

93
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:54,238
of that mid 20th century development,

94
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:57,634
we're beginning to see a new idea about

95
00:04:57,752 --> 00:05:01,154
physics which is roughly encapsulated in

96
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:04,126
quantum information theory. And the new

97
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:07,670
idea is this. It's that what physics is

98
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,526
actually about is information transfer

99
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:15,654
across boundaries and the

100
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:17,866
information we can represent. The

101
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:21,354
information transfer like this. And this

102
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:25,034
is a convention I'll use. A boundary is

103
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:29,870
always a blue ellipse. And the

104
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,854
agents that are exchanging information

105
00:05:31,972 --> 00:05:34,410
across this boundary are conventionally

106
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,958
called Alice and Bob, which is just a

107
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:39,360
more polite way of saying A and B.

108
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,010
And when you think about this picture,

109
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,602
it becomes clear that what physics is

110
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:51,506
really about is communication. And this

111
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:55,126
is a wild redescription of

112
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:58,200
the idea of what physics is compared to

113
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,706
the ideas of Newton or LaPlace

114
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:05,750
or even the 19th century ideas.

115
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,178
And it's very different from the idea

116
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:14,454
that's been preserved in 20th

117
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:17,706
century physics in

118
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:21,566
the lineage of Einstein and others

119
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:25,130
who viewed classical physics

120
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,560
as, in a sense,

121
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,578
either as completely fundamental or as a

122
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:33,810
fundamental adjunct to quantum theory.

123
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,286
So this way of thinking about physics

124
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,426
is a very deeply quantum theoretic way

125
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:44,646
of thinking about physics. And where

126
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:47,974
we're going in this course today is

127
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:51,702
really how did this all happen?

128
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,400
It's the origin story.

129
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,882
And then in the next session, I want to

130
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:00,102
discuss quantum information theory

131
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,322
explicitly and in particular, how

132
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:05,446
quantum theory makes this conclusion

133
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:07,642
that physics is about communication very

134
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:09,502
simple and obvious, much more obvious

135
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:12,814
than it is in classical physics where it

136
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:15,600
takes work to formulate this idea.

137
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,238
Then in the next session, we're going to

138
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:21,578
talk about semantics and how

139
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:24,674
observations become meaningful to the

140
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:27,650
agents who make them and hence how

141
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,970
actions become meaningful to the agents

142
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,134
who make them. Then in August,

143
00:07:33,182 --> 00:07:36,518
we'll talk about communication theory a

144
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:39,014
little bit more explicitly and talk

145
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:41,602
about how agents employ multiple

146
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,786
communication channels when they're

147
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:48,534
communicating. And this

148
00:07:48,572 --> 00:07:50,410
is obvious when you think of people

149
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,266
communicating, they not only talk to

150
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:53,754
each other, they look at the same

151
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,974
things, they point to things, et cetera.

152
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,262
So this is what I mean by multiple

153
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:01,374
communication channels. Then in

154
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:03,262
September, we'll leverage that

155
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,490
discussion to talk about how spacetime

156
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,210
actually emerges from communication.

157
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,166
And this is one of the most important

158
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:13,026
aspects, I think, of quantum information

159
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:15,746
theory. It provides us with a way of

160
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:17,582
viewing spacetime as an emergent

161
00:08:17,646 --> 00:08:20,866
phenomenon, that communication is what

162
00:08:20,888 --> 00:08:24,074
is fundamental in some ontological

163
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:27,654
sense, and the box in which

164
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:29,960
it happens, spacetime is not.

165
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,254
So the final session in October will

166
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:37,254
talk about applications to biology via

167
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:39,978
the free energy principle and future

168
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:42,470
directions both in physics and biology

169
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,226
and elsewhere. So it's going to be an

170
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:49,010
interesting ride. I'm keeping formalism

171
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,314
to a minimum because we're directing

172
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:55,118
this toward the broad array of people

173
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:57,550
who are interested in active inference

174
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,818
and who are involved with the Active

175
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:03,346
Inference Institute. And I would ask you

176
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:06,594
to hold questions because we have a lot

177
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:09,474
to get through in an hour for the

178
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:11,874
interactive discussion and for the

179
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:13,250
discussion forum.

180
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:18,358
So I hope I explain things well enough

181
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:21,382
that all of the concepts will be

182
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,520
understandable. If not,

183
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,542
Wikipedia is actually a wonderful

184
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:29,322
resource in this area for just

185
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:32,134
definitions of terms. So if there's

186
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:36,006
anything that just a term that is a trip

187
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:38,794
up, try Wikipedia. It's probably a very

188
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:41,006
good source for what these terms mean.

189
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:44,542
So let's start our story,

190
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:46,990
as I said, begins in the 19th century.

191
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,630
And in the mid 19th century,

192
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,866
lots of physicists were devoting their

193
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:54,562
efforts to figuring out how to make

194
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:59,810
better steam engines. And one

195
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,146
question that arises when you're trying

196
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,842
to design a steam engine is what happens

197
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:09,734
physically when you add heat to a

198
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:11,638
system at constant temperature? So if

199
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,026
you're building a steam engine, you've

200
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:14,614
got a boiler, because you need to make

201
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:17,514
steam. And as you turn up the heat to

202
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:20,326
your boiler, you get more steam,

203
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:22,794
but the temperature doesn't change. So

204
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:26,582
this is a mystery. What is the heat

205
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:30,926
actually adding to the boiler that

206
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:34,670
is not increasing the temperature?

207
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,646
And Clausius responded to

208
00:10:39,668 --> 00:10:41,886
this question in a way that's sort of

209
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,458
typical for a physicist or a

210
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:46,386
mathematician. Since he didn't know what

211
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:48,642
the answer was, he just invented a new

212
00:10:48,696 --> 00:10:51,186
name for whatever it was and gave it a

213
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,714
formal definition. So he called it

214
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:57,270
entropy, which is a made up word that,

215
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,570
if it was translated from the Greek,

216
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,954
would roughly mean transformation

217
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:05,270
content in trophy.

218
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,914
And he represented it by a

219
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:12,940
simple equation that the change in this

220
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,042
new concept entropy, which is always

221
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:19,422
called S, is just equal to the change

222
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:23,360
in heat Q at constant temperature t.

223
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,926
So obviously, this equation just

224
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:29,242
reformulates the question in declarative

225
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:31,520
form, saying whatever this stuff is,

226
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,970
its changes in this stuff are just

227
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,210
changes in heat at constant temperature.

228
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,982
Well, heat is energy. And this wasn't

229
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:46,326
completely recognized in the mid 19th

230
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:49,222
century, but the way you'll see this

231
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,070
equation in a current textbook is DS is

232
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,154
the change in energy at constant

233
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:57,890
temperature. So even more commonly, you

234
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,834
would see it written as the change in

235
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:02,410
energy is equal to the temperature times

236
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,290
the change in entropy. It's the most

237
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,282
common sort of textbook way of seeing

238
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:10,462
this. But the question, of course, is,

239
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:12,734
what is this quantity? What is this

240
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:15,440
entropy? What does this concept mean?

241
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,442
And about 15 years after Klausius

242
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,746
proposed it, Boltzman had the key

243
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:27,326
insight, which is that entropy

244
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:30,494
is a measurement of our uncertainty

245
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:33,300
about the state the system is in.

246
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,600
And in particular,

247
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,434
he again, of course, went to formalism

248
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:44,246
and said, the entropy S is equal to

249
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:47,962
some constant times

250
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:50,794
the number of states that the system can

251
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:53,820
be in that look the same to us.

252
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,954
And since that number of states is

253
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:58,934
enormous, the way to make that

254
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,646
manageable is to take the log of the

255
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:05,310
number of states. The natural log is ln.

256
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,814
And this constant k is called

257
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:10,270
Baltimore's constant.

258
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,298
And Baltimore was able to do this

259
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:17,774
because he subscribed to a radical,

260
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:22,558
very unpopular theory that material

261
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,894
things, including gases like air,

262
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:29,234
were made of atoms and heat

263
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:32,614
made the atoms move around. And as you

264
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:34,786
increase the amount of heat, the atoms

265
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:37,414
can move in many different ways. So the

266
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:39,562
number of states that they can be in

267
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:42,666
that look the same to us increases. And

268
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,522
that's what entropy is. It's this

269
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:46,586
increase in the number of states that

270
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:50,074
the system can be in that all look

271
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,834
the same to us with the measurements

272
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:53,534
that we can make. And since they look

273
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:55,822
the same to us, we're uncertain about

274
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,840
exactly what state they're in.

275
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,870
So entropy is a measure of uncertainty.

276
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,534
This was really the beginning of modern

277
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:09,794
physics. Because what it says

278
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:13,502
now is that decreasing uncertainty

279
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:16,786
requires energy. It links a measurement

280
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,854
of uncertainty to a measurement of

281
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,814
energy. And if you think about the

282
00:14:21,852 --> 00:14:24,070
uncertainty principle in quantum theory,

283
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,038
the core idea of the uncertainty

284
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,658
principle is you can't measure a system

285
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:34,186
without disturbing it. So to

286
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:37,382
actually act on a system requires

287
00:14:37,446 --> 00:14:39,374
energy. And that's what you have to do

288
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,810
to get information. So here's Boltzman,

289
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,710
basically, inventing quantum theory.

290
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,134
So we're going to fast forward by

291
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:52,000
another 15 years, to 1900.

292
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,594
And in 1900, Planck solved this

293
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:58,542
problem called the black body radiation

294
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,402
problem, which was basically how much

295
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:02,722
heat does your hot boiler give off into

296
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,566
the air? And all

297
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:08,294
of the measurements of the heat that hot

298
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:11,222
boilers gave off to the air ran into

299
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:14,386
problems in classical physics and caused

300
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,926
contradictions and quantities that

301
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:19,674
went to infinity. And all of that was

302
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:22,486
bad. So many people were trying to solve

303
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:25,386
this problem, and Planck solved it by

304
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:28,138
making a simple postulate. He said the

305
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:31,386
energy of the radiation is proportional

306
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:34,414
to its frequency. So its color in the

307
00:15:34,452 --> 00:15:37,310
case of light. And if you go higher

308
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,574
frequency, you end up in ultraviolet and

309
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:42,686
X rays and gamma rays. If you go to

310
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,086
lower frequency, you go into microwaves

311
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:48,514
and radio and all of that. So this is

312
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:51,182
a nice way of talking about radiation.

313
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,026
And it turned out that this solved the

314
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:54,834
problem. I mean, just assuming this

315
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,980
simple proportionality relationship

316
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,990
produced spectra for black body

317
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,166
radiation that worked, that matched what

318
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:05,062
you saw experimentally. Well, this means

319
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:06,678
something very important. It means

320
00:16:06,764 --> 00:16:08,726
because this number h, the

321
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:10,878
proportionality constant called plaque's

322
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:14,198
constant, is a number. It's Finite.

323
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,566
It means that energy comes in discrete

324
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:19,854
units of H. You can have one H or two H

325
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:22,414
or 10 million H, but you can't have half

326
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:24,080
an H of energy.

327
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,634
So it's quantized. And this is widely

328
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:30,506
recognized as the birth of quantum

329
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:33,154
theory. But of course, we should have

330
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,258
known this already. If we just thought a

331
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:39,970
little bit. Right. We Know that changes

332
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,062
of energy are proportional to changes in

333
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,110
entropy by temperature.

334
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,366
And we know that entropy is a measure of

335
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:54,534
the number of states, and numbers of

336
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:57,386
states are just numbers. You can have

337
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,834
one state, two states, three states, 10

338
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:02,490
million states, 100 billion states,

339
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,700
but they're all just a number,

340
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,798
one up. And it's

341
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:11,786
not infinite. There's not an infinite

342
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:13,166
number of states unless you have an

343
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:14,558
infinite amount of energy, which you

344
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:17,742
don't have. So we knew already

345
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:20,026
that entropy could only take discrete

346
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:23,186
values. And since energy and entropy are

347
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,770
basically the same thing, we knew

348
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,010
already that energy could only take

349
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,626
discrete values. So we could have

350
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:33,634
realized in 1900 that energy is

351
00:17:33,672 --> 00:17:35,798
quantized because the number of states

352
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:39,334
is quantized. So it

353
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:41,430
shouldn't have really been a mystery why

354
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,318
energy was quantized, but it was a

355
00:17:43,324 --> 00:17:46,518
mystery, and it stayed a mystery, and it

356
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,042
said, still a mystery. People still

357
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:50,170
debate the meaning of quantum theory,

358
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,506
but another thing we could have known in

359
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:57,260
1900 was something very important,

360
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,830
and it's that this quantum of action,

361
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,310
planck's constant, which has units of

362
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,022
action, which is energy times time, is

363
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:11,066
intimately related to Boltzman's

364
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:14,846
constant. And Boltzman's

365
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:18,882
constant has units of energy

366
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:22,594
over temperature. But this

367
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:24,514
wasn't actually understood until the

368
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:28,494
1950s. No one really figured that

369
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:30,534
this out. There was this relation until

370
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:33,734
the 1950s. And when it was figured out,

371
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:36,146
it was figured out by a guy named Jean

372
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:39,274
Carlo Wick. And he introduced this

373
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:42,614
notion of the Wick rotation by realizing

374
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:44,586
that if you have an equation in

375
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:47,594
classical physics, and in it,

376
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:51,502
there's the term one over KT. You can

377
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:54,494
always replace that one over KT with

378
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:57,454
this other expression. It over h bar. H

379
00:18:57,492 --> 00:19:00,366
bar is just h divided by two pi, and

380
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:02,126
you'll get an equation that's valid in

381
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:05,310
quantum theory. And this is typically

382
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,818
described in textbooks as a trick. And

383
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:10,434
whenever something in physics is

384
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:12,402
described as a trick, what that really

385
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:14,138
means is it's something we don't

386
00:19:14,174 --> 00:19:17,906
understand. And lots

387
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:19,366
of papers have been written about the

388
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:21,030
meaning of the WIC rotation.

389
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,266
But to start to understand the WIC

390
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,834
rotation, I want to look at this

391
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:29,980
equation a little bit.

392
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,900
One over KT is one over in energy,

393
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,514
and it over h bar is

394
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:45,066
one over in energy. Since h bar is units

395
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:48,862
of energy times time, we have time

396
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:52,154
in this equation, and then we have this

397
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:55,234
factor, I, which is typically thought of

398
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:58,066
as just an imaginary number. So it's the

399
00:19:58,088 --> 00:20:01,294
square root of minus one. And what's

400
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:04,046
this I doing in this equation? And in

401
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:06,454
fact, you see factors of it over h bar.

402
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:08,002
If you're familiar with quantum theory

403
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:11,698
everywhere in quantum theory.

404
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:15,170
So what's the meaning of this imaginary

405
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,986
number? And if

406
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:22,394
you just think of it or of I as

407
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:25,002
this arbitrary imaginary number that

408
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:27,610
somehow renders the equation mysterious,

409
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,754
then the whole of quantum theory is

410
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:33,486
mysterious, but the Wick rotation is

411
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:37,406
very mysterious. But what I is actually

412
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:41,102
is an operator. And if you

413
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,910
think of the real numbers as an axis,

414
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,234
which is always drawn horizontally. So

415
00:20:47,272 --> 00:20:50,994
here it is. Here's zero, and the

416
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,058
axis is pointing that way. I'm sorry, I

417
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:54,454
can't get the camera really far enough

418
00:20:54,492 --> 00:20:58,070
away to see my arm here. So what is I?

419
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,890
I is actually an operator that rotates

420
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,190
the whole real axis by 90 degrees.

421
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,142
So if you see a plot of complex numbers,

422
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:10,794
then the real numbers go this way, and

423
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:12,746
the, quote, imaginary numbers go that

424
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:15,226
way. So what multiplying by I has done

425
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:18,554
is rotate by 90 degrees. And of course,

426
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:21,066
if you do I squared, you rotate twice by

427
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:22,926
90 degrees by arm would do this, but you

428
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,166
end up pointing that way, and those are

429
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:28,414
the negative numbers. So I is

430
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:31,310
an operator that rotates something by 90

431
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,674
degrees, and if you rotate four times by

432
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:37,358
90 degrees, you're back to the identity.

433
00:21:37,534 --> 00:21:39,780
So I to the fourth is one.

434
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,802
So this tells us something very

435
00:21:42,856 --> 00:21:45,266
interesting, which is that what the WIC

436
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:48,006
rotation is really talking about is a

437
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:52,230
rotation. It's a geometrical equation.

438
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,674
And in July, we'll come back

439
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,862
to this and really probe what this Wick

440
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:02,410
rotation means physically.

441
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,218
But as I said, this wasn't understood to

442
00:22:08,224 --> 00:22:11,982
the 1950s, and by the 1950s, a lot had

443
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:14,526
happened. So quantum theory had been

444
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:16,526
developed. Bohren Einstein had had their

445
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,574
debate. Particle accelerators had been

446
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:20,574
built. The atomic bomb had been built.

447
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:23,140
Nuclear physics was well in its way,

448
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,190
so an enormous amount of practical

449
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,734
physics had been done. Quantum theory

450
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,434
was highly developed. People were

451
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:34,014
starting to think about quantum field

452
00:22:34,072 --> 00:22:37,238
theory before they made this simple

453
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:39,158
realization that's formulated in the

454
00:22:39,164 --> 00:22:42,134
Wick rotation. So this is a harboring of

455
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:44,950
things to come. But before we continue

456
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,138
in physics, we need to backtrack in time

457
00:22:48,224 --> 00:22:50,266
a little bit and look at what the

458
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:54,058
mathematicians were doing. So across the

459
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:56,698
hall in the math department, one year

460
00:22:56,784 --> 00:23:00,000
after the Solve conference in 1929,

461
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,390
kurt Godel proved his famous first

462
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,186
incompleteness theorem. And the theorem

463
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,014
states that no formal system that

464
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:09,742
contains arithmetic can be both

465
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:11,280
consistent and complete.

466
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,554
And that means that either there are

467
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:18,306
true statements that aren't provable in

468
00:23:18,328 --> 00:23:22,046
the formal system, or there are false

469
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:24,886
statements that are provable, or, of

470
00:23:24,908 --> 00:23:28,786
course, both. And Godel's

471
00:23:28,978 --> 00:23:31,878
proof is actually extremely simple.

472
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:35,560
Almost all of the work in the proof is

473
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,602
setting up all of the notation and

474
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:41,382
procedures and so forth to formulate

475
00:23:41,446 --> 00:23:44,602
within arithmetic the

476
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:48,010
sentence, this sentence is not provable.

477
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,002
And once you have that sentence

478
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:54,414
formulated within arithmetic, then the

479
00:23:54,452 --> 00:23:57,614
conclusion of the proof is obvious. If

480
00:23:57,652 --> 00:23:59,150
you can prove the sentence, this

481
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,078
sentence is not provable, then you've

482
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:04,994
proved something that's false. And if

483
00:24:05,032 --> 00:24:07,138
you can't prove it, then there are

484
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:09,586
sentences that you can't prove in

485
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:12,514
arithmetic. So this was incredibly bad

486
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:15,798
news for mathematicians who thought that

487
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:18,454
finite discrete operations, which is

488
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:20,342
what proofs are and also what

489
00:24:20,396 --> 00:24:22,994
computations are, can exhaustively

490
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:25,366
enumerate the facts and this was the

491
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:28,494
assumption behind Wittgenstein's claim

492
00:24:28,562 --> 00:24:31,370
that the world is all that is the case,

493
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,378
the world is a collection of facts. And

494
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:36,714
optimistically, he thought that first

495
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:38,918
order logic would allow us to enumerate

496
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:41,786
all those facts and we'd be done dreams

497
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:43,600
of a final theory again.

498
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,982
So Godel's Theorem means that no system

499
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:51,406
with finite capabilities, no system that

500
00:24:51,428 --> 00:24:54,106
can just do finite discrete operations,

501
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:57,474
can fully describe its environment. It

502
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:59,410
will always be in an environment where

503
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,814
there are true things that aren't

504
00:25:00,862 --> 00:25:03,026
provable or false things that are

505
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:06,674
provable. But I think more relative

506
00:25:06,802 --> 00:25:09,126
to a discussion of agents is that it

507
00:25:09,148 --> 00:25:12,040
means that no agent can describe itself.

508
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,470
Any agent's theory of itself will

509
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,034
either contain true statements that it

510
00:25:19,072 --> 00:25:22,746
can't derive or false statements, or it

511
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:24,506
will either miss true statements that it

512
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:26,954
can't derive or wind up deriving things

513
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,934
that are false about itself. Of course,

514
00:25:29,972 --> 00:25:32,320
we see this in psychology all the time.

515
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,186
So an immediate consequence of Godel's

516
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:38,734
Theorem was an intense investigation of

517
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:41,374
what computation actually is, what it

518
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:43,386
meant to talk about finite discrete

519
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:46,850
operations. And two leaders of this

520
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,026
were, of course, Church and Turing. And

521
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,622
here's a picture of a Turing machine,

522
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:52,338
which is just a little device with a

523
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:55,118
couple of tapes and a tape reader and a

524
00:25:55,144 --> 00:25:57,446
simple logic unit that either writes a

525
00:25:57,468 --> 00:25:59,846
one or a zero if it sees a one or a

526
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:03,990
zero. And they defined a computation

527
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,334
as a process that can be implemented in

528
00:26:07,372 --> 00:26:10,634
finite time by such a machine or by

529
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:13,306
Church's lambda calculus or by any of

530
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:15,066
the now hundreds of other methods that

531
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:16,774
are provably equivalent to a Turing

532
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:19,820
machine. So what does this mean?

533
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,098
It means that computation is a physical

534
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:25,438
process that can be mechanized and it

535
00:26:25,444 --> 00:26:27,726
turns out, mechanized in any one of a

536
00:26:27,748 --> 00:26:31,342
huge array of ways. It means that many

537
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:33,502
different implementations of any

538
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:35,726
computation are possible. So I can do it

539
00:26:35,748 --> 00:26:37,874
on a Turing machine, I can do it on my

540
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:39,886
laptop, I can do it on my head, et

541
00:26:39,918 --> 00:26:42,706
cetera. The most important things it

542
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:44,194
means is that there are questions with

543
00:26:44,232 --> 00:26:46,398
no computable answer. This is the

544
00:26:46,424 --> 00:26:49,238
Revenge of Godel's theorem. And two of

545
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:51,110
the most famous questions of this kind

546
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,134
are given some arbitrary program. Will

547
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:56,406
it halt? Will it get to an answer in

548
00:26:56,428 --> 00:27:00,058
finite time? And the answer to

549
00:27:00,064 --> 00:27:02,410
that question is this is undecidable.

550
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,260
No procedure can figure this out.

551
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,558
And the other undecidable

552
00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:12,314
question is, given some arbitrary

553
00:27:12,362 --> 00:27:14,670
program, what function does it compute?

554
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,766
And you'd think that would be simple,

555
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,494
that you can read a program and figure

556
00:27:18,532 --> 00:27:21,406
out what function it computes. But it

557
00:27:21,428 --> 00:27:24,146
turns out that is undecidable. That

558
00:27:24,248 --> 00:27:27,620
cannot be done by any finite process.

559
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,514
So this was another

560
00:27:32,632 --> 00:27:36,002
body blow to the goal of understanding

561
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:38,994
everything with finite discrete

562
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:42,294
processes. But it also set the stage for

563
00:27:42,332 --> 00:27:45,110
something new. It set the stage for

564
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,534
thinking about an agent who interacts

565
00:27:48,582 --> 00:27:51,754
with a computational process by giving

566
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:54,554
it an input and then looking at its

567
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:56,380
output sometime later.

568
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,362
And this, of course, will look familiar

569
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:02,346
because I've included the blue ellipse,

570
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:04,542
which is the boundary, which these days

571
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:06,590
we call a user interface.

572
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,782
And the user interface just allows some

573
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:14,226
finite action on the system and then the

574
00:28:14,248 --> 00:28:16,606
ability to observe some finite response

575
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:19,714
by the system. So we can now ask what

576
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:22,962
can Alice determine by acting in some

577
00:28:23,016 --> 00:28:25,954
finite way and then making some finite

578
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:29,570
number of observations I. E. Receiving

579
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,846
some finite number of outputs from the

580
00:28:31,868 --> 00:28:33,880
system that she's acting on.

581
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,222
And the first 20 years of this produced

582
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:41,514
a large number of answers, all of them

583
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:44,874
negative. So to go back to Turing, he

584
00:28:44,912 --> 00:28:47,782
proved that Alice can't tell what's

585
00:28:47,846 --> 00:28:49,866
implementing the function that she sees

586
00:28:49,898 --> 00:28:53,086
being implemented. She can't tell

587
00:28:53,188 --> 00:28:56,526
whether a given input will lead to an

588
00:28:56,548 --> 00:28:58,560
output. That's the halting problem.

589
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,914
Shannon showed that Alice can't tell

590
00:29:02,952 --> 00:29:05,380
what the inputs mean to the system.

591
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,930
His whole theory of communication is

592
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,330
completely independent of semantics.

593
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,238
And his theory of communication actually

594
00:29:15,324 --> 00:29:17,494
accurately describes what Alice can

595
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:21,126
observe. Rice is the

596
00:29:21,148 --> 00:29:24,994
one who proved that you can't determine

597
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:29,130
what program is generating the outputs.

598
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,298
And then Moore proved a very similar

599
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:34,486
result in a completely different formal

600
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:36,586
setting of general cybernetics that you

601
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,342
can't tell what process is generating

602
00:29:38,406 --> 00:29:41,982
the outputs by finite observation. But

603
00:29:42,036 --> 00:29:45,450
what Alice can do is build a predictive

604
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,974
model of what generates the output she

605
00:29:49,012 --> 00:29:51,822
sees in response to her inputs and test

606
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:55,790
it by designing new inputs. And this

607
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,722
is, of course, as Karl Popper told us,

608
00:29:58,776 --> 00:30:01,842
the process that we call science. So

609
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:04,422
Alice can do science even though she

610
00:30:04,476 --> 00:30:06,434
can't answer any of these fundamental

611
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:07,080
questions.

612
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,830
Now, this, of course, has a huge

613
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:17,500
technological consequence since

614
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:21,690
this theory of computation tells us that

615
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,730
processes are effectively virtual.

616
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,550
We don't know what they are and we can't

617
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,734
determine what they are except in

618
00:30:30,772 --> 00:30:32,910
theory. By making a theory

619
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,510
technologically, it means we're free to

620
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,774
use virtualization everywhere because we

621
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:43,074
have to deal with it anyway. And this

622
00:30:43,112 --> 00:30:44,862
allows us to build multilevel

623
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,834
architectures. It means that we can

624
00:30:46,872 --> 00:30:49,666
architect computers where no layer of

625
00:30:49,688 --> 00:30:52,366
the computation has any idea what's

626
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:55,042
going on below or above it and doesn't

627
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:59,090
need to. And that's what makes practical

628
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:02,822
programming possible. So from these

629
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:05,302
no go theorems that tell you what you

630
00:31:05,356 --> 00:31:09,398
can't do, you actually get an enormous

631
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:13,050
boost into it and

632
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,234
use to probe the world and

633
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:18,780
develop theories and on and on and on.

634
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:24,014
So in a sense, Godel birthed not

635
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:26,250
only computer science, but practical

636
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,334
computing by showing us that

637
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:30,958
virtualization is just the way the world

638
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:34,370
works. So now let's go back to physics

639
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,766
where these ideas were replicated,

640
00:31:38,878 --> 00:31:42,082
basically reintroduced, reinvented by

641
00:31:42,136 --> 00:31:45,746
Feynman in developing his path

642
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,230
integral formulation of quantum theory.

643
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,054
And basically what Feyman realized was

644
00:31:52,092 --> 00:31:54,440
that in any physical process,

645
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,898
the observer Alice prepares some

646
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,154
state that she's interested in. She

647
00:32:02,192 --> 00:32:04,730
prepares some input to an experiment.

648
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,874
Then she lets something happen, and then

649
00:32:08,912 --> 00:32:10,814
she sees what the result of the

650
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:13,754
experiment is. And the canonical

651
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:16,110
experiment in physics is scattering.

652
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,614
You fire two protons at each other,

653
00:32:19,652 --> 00:32:21,922
and they intersect someplace, and stuff

654
00:32:21,976 --> 00:32:23,346
comes out, and you measure the stuff

655
00:32:23,368 --> 00:32:27,074
that comes out. And what

656
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:30,446
you can measure is momentum and spin

657
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:32,580
energy, things like that position.

658
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:37,510
So these processes

659
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,982
conserve the total values of the things

660
00:32:41,036 --> 00:32:43,014
you can measure. So in particular, they

661
00:32:43,052 --> 00:32:45,490
preserve momentum and angular momentum,

662
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,914
and they preserve other things that

663
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:51,930
are harder to measure and are only

664
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,754
approximately conserved anyway, like

665
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:56,646
Lepton number. But Feynman's

666
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:59,374
contribution to this way of thinking

667
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:02,238
about experiments was to say, look, if

668
00:33:02,244 --> 00:33:04,894
you want to understand the output, you

669
00:33:04,932 --> 00:33:08,478
have to sum over all of the possible

670
00:33:08,644 --> 00:33:11,134
processes that could have produced the

671
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:14,002
output from the input, no matter how

672
00:33:14,056 --> 00:33:16,020
improbable they are.

673
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,934
So the famous idea from Feynman

674
00:33:19,982 --> 00:33:23,022
diagrams is if you have an electron

675
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:26,294
that's scattering off an atom, you

676
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:27,926
measure the initial state of the

677
00:33:27,948 --> 00:33:30,246
electron that you've generated with an

678
00:33:30,268 --> 00:33:32,326
accelerator or something, and you

679
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:34,242
measure the final state, which involves

680
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:37,302
momentum and spin and so forth. And for

681
00:33:37,356 --> 00:33:41,386
all you knew, partway through

682
00:33:41,408 --> 00:33:44,598
the process, the electron disappeared,

683
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:48,474
and an entire universe appeared and

684
00:33:48,512 --> 00:33:50,846
then annihilated with a copy of an

685
00:33:50,868 --> 00:33:53,962
entire anti universe, and the electron

686
00:33:54,026 --> 00:33:56,954
came back out. And you have to include

687
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,846
processes like that if you really want

688
00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:01,954
to understand and correctly predict the

689
00:34:01,992 --> 00:34:04,834
outcomes of your measurements. And

690
00:34:04,952 --> 00:34:08,290
Murray Gelman lifted

691
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,394
the bumper sticker slogan from Th White

692
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:13,730
and the once and Future King everything

693
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,274
not explicitly forbidden is mandatory.

694
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:18,520
That sums up Feynman's idea.

695
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,322
And this is called the totalitarian

696
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:24,758
principle, since it's what's written in

697
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:27,418
Th White's book on the kingdom of the

698
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:30,122
ants, for which everything not

699
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:32,490
explicitly forbidden is mandatory.

700
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,740
So let's think about a real example

701
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,566
that's a bit actually, it's the same as

702
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:41,194
scattering. The ultimate scattering

703
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:45,470
experiment in physics is a black hole.

704
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,946
Stuff goes into the horizon, stars,

705
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:53,218
whole galaxies, whatever. Something

706
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:56,914
happens, and stuff comes out. And what

707
00:34:56,952 --> 00:34:59,010
comes out is Hawking radiation,

708
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,042
and information is

709
00:35:03,096 --> 00:35:05,558
conserved if the information in the

710
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:07,782
Hawking radiation is actually the same

711
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:09,926
as the information in the stuff that

712
00:35:09,948 --> 00:35:13,430
went in. And conservation

713
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,910
is not qualitative. It's quantitative.

714
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,066
It's only the quantity of information

715
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:22,346
that's supposed to be preserved. And you

716
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:25,754
can ask, how much is the information

717
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:28,166
that's being emitted by a black hole

718
00:35:28,198 --> 00:35:31,774
that's emitting Hawking radiation? And

719
00:35:31,972 --> 00:35:34,414
Beckenstein was the one who figured this

720
00:35:34,452 --> 00:35:36,606
out, using an incredibly simple

721
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:39,470
argument. But I'll just give the answer

722
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,210
here. The answer is that the total

723
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,258
entropy of the black hole is its area

724
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:47,940
divided by four,

725
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:52,674
and the area in this equation has

726
00:35:52,712 --> 00:35:54,726
to be computed in Planck units, which

727
00:35:54,748 --> 00:35:57,526
are units where Planck's constant and

728
00:35:57,548 --> 00:35:59,266
the speed of light and boltzman's

729
00:35:59,298 --> 00:36:01,254
constant and other interesting things

730
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,854
are all set equal to one. So one

731
00:36:04,892 --> 00:36:07,922
Planck area is the Planck length

732
00:36:07,986 --> 00:36:10,134
squared, which turns out to be about ten

733
00:36:10,172 --> 00:36:14,282
to the minus squared. So this

734
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:16,074
is that black holes are the most

735
00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:18,460
entropic entities we know of.

736
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,686
So a black hole about this big with

737
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:26,554
a radius of about a meter has an entropy

738
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:30,158
of about ten to the 70th, which is, of

739
00:36:30,164 --> 00:36:32,500
course, an astonishingly big number,

740
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:38,034
and a black hole with

741
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:41,614
the area of the sun. So a moderate sized

742
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:44,514
cosmological black hole, a real thing

743
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:47,346
that we can observe with a gravity wave

744
00:36:47,378 --> 00:36:50,386
telescope or something, has an entropy

745
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:53,846
of about ten to the 79th. And really

746
00:36:53,948 --> 00:36:56,006
big black holes, which are bigger than

747
00:36:56,028 --> 00:36:58,934
the entire solar system, have entropies

748
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:03,706
into the ten to the

749
00:37:03,728 --> 00:37:06,982
something. So these are enormously

750
00:37:07,046 --> 00:37:08,650
entropic entities.

751
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,550
But Beckenstein didn't just tell us

752
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,790
that. He told us something about the

753
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,290
structure of the interface, the horizon

754
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,786
of a black hole. And this is what he

755
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:23,700
told us.

756
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,162
You can compute entropy in bits just by

757
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:33,998
using logs, base two

758
00:37:34,104 --> 00:37:36,950
instead of logs based e, natural logs.

759
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:41,106
And that's just multiplying the natural

760
00:37:41,138 --> 00:37:43,560
log by about 1.4.

761
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,734
So we can write the entropy of black

762
00:37:47,772 --> 00:37:50,646
hole, of black hole in units of bits,

763
00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:54,346
and it's about a over six. So what does

764
00:37:54,368 --> 00:37:57,546
this mean to say that we can think of

765
00:37:57,568 --> 00:38:01,134
the entropy in terms of bits? What it

766
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:02,782
says is that we can think of the

767
00:38:02,836 --> 00:38:06,270
interface in terms of a bit array,

768
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,070
and we can think of all of these bits

769
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:16,530
as encoded on this interface

770
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,170
at a density of one bit every

771
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,738
roughly six

772
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:28,690
plank lengths squared, six plank areas.

773
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,266
So this is an incredibly dense encoding

774
00:38:31,298 --> 00:38:32,470
in a black hole.

775
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,594
And it's an interesting idea about black

776
00:38:36,652 --> 00:38:38,874
holes. But what gets really interesting

777
00:38:38,992 --> 00:38:41,498
is what happens when you generalize it.

778
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:44,746
And of course, physicists are prone to

779
00:38:44,768 --> 00:38:46,570
generalization, and that's what happened

780
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,260
next.

781
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,294
Gerard to Hooft, almost immediately

782
00:38:52,342 --> 00:38:53,786
thereafter, on the basis of

783
00:38:53,808 --> 00:38:55,758
Beckenstein's work, formulated the

784
00:38:55,764 --> 00:38:59,086
Holographic principle. And what

785
00:38:59,108 --> 00:39:01,294
the Holographic principle says is we can

786
00:39:01,332 --> 00:39:04,994
think of any system as approximately a

787
00:39:05,032 --> 00:39:08,414
black hole. And the only approximation

788
00:39:08,462 --> 00:39:12,642
is the encoding density. The boundary of

789
00:39:12,696 --> 00:39:16,134
any system encodes the information

790
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:20,102
that we can get about the system at

791
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:22,294
some density. And the density is less

792
00:39:22,332 --> 00:39:24,354
than the density for a black hole

793
00:39:24,402 --> 00:39:28,034
because we're not black holes. And this

794
00:39:28,092 --> 00:39:31,082
rules out a lot by limiting the amount

795
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,434
of information that you can extract from

796
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:35,818
a system to the amount of information

797
00:39:35,904 --> 00:39:38,250
that you can actually write on its

798
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,066
boundary. And one of the things that it

799
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:43,742
rules out is knowing the geometry on the

800
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:46,798
inside of the system. And to Hoof put it

801
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:48,618
this way, which I think is a brilliant

802
00:39:48,634 --> 00:39:50,734
thought experiment, he says, look, the

803
00:39:50,772 --> 00:39:53,358
metric inside this system can be so

804
00:39:53,444 --> 00:39:57,034
curved, effectively the space time

805
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:59,426
inside the system can be so curved that

806
00:39:59,448 --> 00:40:01,294
you could stick an entire universe

807
00:40:01,342 --> 00:40:04,146
inside. And we never know because it

808
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:07,066
wouldn't change the amount of entropy

809
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:08,966
number of bits that are encoded on the

810
00:40:08,988 --> 00:40:12,742
boundary. So the inside geometry can be

811
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:15,414
anything. And you can't find out by.

812
00:40:15,452 --> 00:40:17,740
Looking at the outside of the system.

813
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:22,026
Now, the Holographic principle almost

814
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,010
follows from classical physics.

815
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,406
There's Euler's theorem,

816
00:40:28,598 --> 00:40:32,474
which tells you about one over R squared

817
00:40:32,522 --> 00:40:35,854
forces, and you can think of the

818
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:38,302
force as penetrating the boundary at

819
00:40:38,356 --> 00:40:42,066
some density. And the

820
00:40:42,088 --> 00:40:45,714
difference between Euler's theorem and

821
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:47,954
the Holographic principle is just that

822
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:50,226
the density in classical physics can go

823
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:54,174
to infinity. And in the Holographic

824
00:40:54,222 --> 00:40:57,126
principle, it can only go to this

825
00:40:57,228 --> 00:40:59,366
maximal density that's achieved by a

826
00:40:59,388 --> 00:41:02,118
black hole. Why? Because if you try to

827
00:41:02,124 --> 00:41:04,934
get any higher, more information, the

828
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:06,614
information gets sucked into the black

829
00:41:06,652 --> 00:41:09,100
hole, and you can't get it out.

830
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,998
So the Holographic principle becomes

831
00:41:15,174 --> 00:41:17,898
a guiding principle for thinking about

832
00:41:17,984 --> 00:41:21,550
any physical system and what it means to

833
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,882
extract information from a physical

834
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:27,694
system. And in fact, we'll talk about

835
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:31,246
this next time. You can say exactly what

836
00:41:31,268 --> 00:41:33,294
the information encoded on the boundary

837
00:41:33,342 --> 00:41:35,060
of any system is.

838
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,066
And what I'll go through next time is

839
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:43,326
seeing that the information that's

840
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:45,094
encoded on the boundary is a

841
00:41:45,132 --> 00:41:47,862
specification of the energy that's being

842
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:50,646
exchanged by the interaction, which, of

843
00:41:50,668 --> 00:41:53,106
course, is linear in the number of bits.

844
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:55,830
It's just counting the number of bits.

845
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,254
Okay? So with the Holographic

846
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:03,722
principle, we now have a complete new

847
00:42:03,776 --> 00:42:06,554
science about systems that are

848
00:42:06,592 --> 00:42:10,126
exchanging finite discrete information

849
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:13,774
across a boundary by encoding that

850
00:42:13,812 --> 00:42:16,718
information on the boundary and then

851
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:18,846
reading the information off the

852
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:22,002
boundary. So here's a

853
00:42:22,056 --> 00:42:24,542
new way of thinking about physical

854
00:42:24,606 --> 00:42:27,906
interaction. Alice writes a message on

855
00:42:27,928 --> 00:42:31,166
her boundary with Bob, and Bob reads

856
00:42:31,198 --> 00:42:34,774
the message off the boundary and

857
00:42:34,812 --> 00:42:36,982
then writes his own new message, which

858
00:42:37,036 --> 00:42:40,466
Alice then reads. And of course, that's

859
00:42:40,498 --> 00:42:42,280
what's happening right now.

860
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:47,658
I'm writing information by speaking on

861
00:42:47,744 --> 00:42:49,994
an interface, which is effectively the

862
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:52,634
Internet. And you're reading that

863
00:42:52,672 --> 00:42:55,114
information off the Internet by

864
00:42:55,152 --> 00:42:58,042
listening to it. And when we get time

865
00:42:58,096 --> 00:43:00,202
for questions, you'll be writing

866
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:03,146
information on the Internet, which I'll

867
00:43:03,178 --> 00:43:06,542
be reading. Now, the key thing about

868
00:43:06,596 --> 00:43:08,666
this new science is that it's

869
00:43:08,698 --> 00:43:11,630
topological. It's about connectivity

870
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,642
across some communication channel,

871
00:43:14,776 --> 00:43:17,454
which we represent as a boundary. It's

872
00:43:17,502 --> 00:43:20,958
not geometric, so it doesn't assume

873
00:43:21,054 --> 00:43:24,790
anything about spacetime. So it

874
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,950
allows us to build a model of

875
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,922
space in particular as an emergent

876
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:35,286
phenomenon. And it allows us to see

877
00:43:35,388 --> 00:43:39,020
time as not some absolute

878
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:43,178
external abstraction, but something

879
00:43:43,264 --> 00:43:46,150
that the communicating agents measure

880
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:49,742
for themselves. And so they each

881
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:53,646
act in their own time. And we

882
00:43:53,668 --> 00:43:57,134
get a very natural measure of time in

883
00:43:57,172 --> 00:43:59,822
terms of how many bits I see coming

884
00:43:59,876 --> 00:44:01,590
across my boundary. And again, we'll

885
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,394
talk about that in the next couple of

886
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:07,234
sessions and then talk

887
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:08,910
about it more thoroughly in September

888
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,250
when we talk about emergent spacetime.

889
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:15,126
So quantum information theory looks very

890
00:44:15,228 --> 00:44:17,142
different from the physics that came

891
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,786
before, not because it's adopted

892
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:24,226
a new formalism, the tools of quantum

893
00:44:24,258 --> 00:44:26,898
theory. It's because it's entirely

894
00:44:26,994 --> 00:44:29,638
changed the thinking about what physics

895
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:33,942
is and what it's about and replace

896
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:37,206
this idea of forces and balls banging

897
00:44:37,238 --> 00:44:39,454
into each other and all of that with the

898
00:44:39,492 --> 00:44:41,840
idea of communication between agents.

899
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:45,486
And of course that's familiar from an

900
00:44:45,508 --> 00:44:48,894
active inference perspective. So we can

901
00:44:48,932 --> 00:44:52,386
now back up a little bit to see what

902
00:44:52,408 --> 00:44:54,622
they were doing in classical physics

903
00:44:54,686 --> 00:44:57,298
during this period. Well, let me go on a

904
00:44:57,304 --> 00:44:58,340
little bit. Sorry.

905
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:05,830
This is just a slide quoting Wheeler,

906
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,286
who of course is the most radical in

907
00:45:09,308 --> 00:45:12,070
terms of impitheist, in terms of

908
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,702
formulating these ideas. But here's his

909
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:18,250
characterization of this new physics.

910
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:22,138
It's not reductive. All of

911
00:45:22,144 --> 00:45:25,766
the reasoning is circular. You don't

912
00:45:25,798 --> 00:45:28,962
have smaller things and then yet smaller

913
00:45:29,046 --> 00:45:30,830
things, and then yet smaller things

914
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,510
forever. There are no laws.

915
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:40,366
So what you see on the interface is

916
00:45:40,388 --> 00:45:43,758
a message. It's not something that's

917
00:45:43,854 --> 00:45:46,066
governed by laws since the beginning of

918
00:45:46,088 --> 00:45:49,406
the universe. There's no continuum.

919
00:45:49,518 --> 00:45:51,714
So there's nothing described by real

920
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:53,930
numbers. It's all described by integers.

921
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,826
Everything's done in finite dimensional

922
00:45:55,858 --> 00:45:58,294
spaces. And finally, and most

923
00:45:58,332 --> 00:46:01,046
importantly, there's no spacetime box in

924
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:04,022
which things happen. So think of how

925
00:46:04,076 --> 00:46:07,162
radical this is means. There's no big

926
00:46:07,216 --> 00:46:10,730
bang, there's no big rip,

927
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,346
there's no bouncing universe. All of

928
00:46:14,368 --> 00:46:16,282
those ideas are out the window because

929
00:46:16,336 --> 00:46:18,330
they're classical and they're about

930
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,514
spacetime. And what the new physics

931
00:46:21,562 --> 00:46:24,782
wants to do is derive spacetime out of

932
00:46:24,836 --> 00:46:27,390
basically users experiences.

933
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:32,542
So the agents here are all observer

934
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:36,142
participants in Wheeler's language.

935
00:46:36,206 --> 00:46:40,354
But what that just means is agents that

936
00:46:40,392 --> 00:46:42,082
want to communicate and it's their

937
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:43,666
communication that gives rise to

938
00:46:43,688 --> 00:46:47,174
physics. So now we'll go back to

939
00:46:47,212 --> 00:46:50,854
classical physics and what was

940
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,054
happening, or one thing that was

941
00:46:52,092 --> 00:46:53,766
happening in classical physics at that

942
00:46:53,788 --> 00:46:55,960
time was a lot of thinking about

943
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:58,810
stochastic causal networks.

944
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:04,150
And Pearl realized

945
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,486
that if you have any stochastic causal

946
00:47:06,518 --> 00:47:09,758
network that's unidirectional, then

947
00:47:09,844 --> 00:47:13,214
around any node, you can draw what he

948
00:47:13,252 --> 00:47:16,266
called a Markov blanket. And a Markov

949
00:47:16,298 --> 00:47:18,286
blanket is just the set of nodes in the

950
00:47:18,308 --> 00:47:22,654
network that absorb

951
00:47:22,702 --> 00:47:25,854
all outside causation and then transmit

952
00:47:25,902 --> 00:47:28,126
that causation into whatever node you're

953
00:47:28,158 --> 00:47:30,962
interested in and then absorb all

954
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:33,006
causation coming from the node you're

955
00:47:33,038 --> 00:47:35,926
interested in and transmit it to the

956
00:47:35,948 --> 00:47:39,254
rest of the world. And so we

957
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:42,710
can redraw that in Part B here,

958
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,886
and it should look very familiar. A

959
00:47:44,908 --> 00:47:46,814
Markov blanket is just a classical

960
00:47:46,882 --> 00:47:48,458
physics way of talking about a

961
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:51,962
Holographic screen. And the number

962
00:47:52,016 --> 00:47:54,982
of nodes in the Markov blanket,

963
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:58,214
or in particular the number of degrees

964
00:47:58,262 --> 00:48:00,826
of freedom times the number of nodes,

965
00:48:00,938 --> 00:48:03,194
is just the number of bits that flow

966
00:48:03,242 --> 00:48:06,606
across that Markov blanket. So it's the

967
00:48:06,628 --> 00:48:08,874
entropy of the effective Holographic

968
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:09,520
screen.

969
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,946
All these ideas were reinvented more or

970
00:48:14,968 --> 00:48:17,374
less independently within classical

971
00:48:17,422 --> 00:48:21,342
physics. And it was from this classical

972
00:48:21,406 --> 00:48:25,166
physics background that Karl

973
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:27,026
Freston came up with the idea that a

974
00:48:27,048 --> 00:48:29,730
Markov blanket defines a persistence,

975
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,136
at least from an active inference

976
00:48:35,168 --> 00:48:36,964
institute point of view everyone is

977
00:48:37,002 --> 00:48:39,176
familiar with, because it's the

978
00:48:39,198 --> 00:48:40,996
foundation of the idea of active

979
00:48:41,028 --> 00:48:41,960
inference.

980
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,644
Any system that persists

981
00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:52,940
through time does so by making

982
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,244
sure that it doesn't dissolve into its

983
00:48:55,282 --> 00:48:58,284
environment. Well, what does that mean?

984
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:01,340
It means it persists through time by

985
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:04,156
maintaining the integrity of its Markov

986
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:06,192
blanket or the integrity of its

987
00:49:06,246 --> 00:49:09,504
boundary. So this of course is just a

988
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:12,828
tautology, but it's

989
00:49:12,844 --> 00:49:14,972
a very interesting and very productive

990
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:18,772
tautology because it says that any

991
00:49:18,826 --> 00:49:21,860
system is using the information it gets

992
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,564
on its boundary from its environment to

993
00:49:24,602 --> 00:49:26,352
build a model of how its environment

994
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:29,704
behaves. And then it

995
00:49:29,742 --> 00:49:32,104
uses that model to act back on its

996
00:49:32,142 --> 00:49:35,032
environment to test and refine its

997
00:49:35,086 --> 00:49:38,232
model. And again, as Popper told us,

998
00:49:38,286 --> 00:49:42,284
this is just what science is. So what

999
00:49:42,322 --> 00:49:44,216
the free energy principle really tells

1000
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:47,036
us is that all systems are agents that

1001
00:49:47,058 --> 00:49:49,470
are doing science all the time.

1002
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,224
So physics is effectively not

1003
00:49:54,262 --> 00:49:57,360
just the study of communication, but

1004
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:01,132
it's the study of agents doing science

1005
00:50:01,196 --> 00:50:03,824
with each other, pairs of agents who are

1006
00:50:03,862 --> 00:50:08,050
trying to figure each other out by their

1007
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,060
communicative exchanges.

1008
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,364
So that's the history of how

1009
00:50:15,402 --> 00:50:18,768
we got from 1930s sorry,

1010
00:50:18,874 --> 00:50:22,456
1850s thermodynamics to the

1011
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:26,090
free energy principle and

1012
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,896
how the free energy principle connects

1013
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,152
to these very deep and extremely

1014
00:50:34,216 --> 00:50:38,152
radical, especially within context ideas

1015
00:50:38,216 --> 00:50:41,464
in quantum theory and quantum cosmology

1016
00:50:41,512 --> 00:50:44,912
and computer science. All of which tell

1017
00:50:44,966 --> 00:50:48,688
us that the world

1018
00:50:48,774 --> 00:50:51,920
we see is a

1019
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:55,868
projection that's being written on our

1020
00:50:55,974 --> 00:50:59,396
boundaries by a process that we

1021
00:50:59,418 --> 00:51:04,132
have no access to except the

1022
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,884
procedure of active inference or the

1023
00:51:06,922 --> 00:51:10,648
procedure of science, which is to

1024
00:51:10,814 --> 00:51:13,080
formulate predictive models and test

1025
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:17,048
them by doing things in the world and

1026
00:51:17,134 --> 00:51:19,560
seeing how the world responds.

1027
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,260
So that's it for this session.

1028
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,516
The first discussion session which

1029
00:51:29,618 --> 00:51:32,156
Andrew is going to lead will be the 3

1030
00:51:32,178 --> 00:51:35,344
June at this same time, I E

1031
00:51:35,382 --> 00:51:39,490
05:00 European time. And then

1032
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,144
my session number two will be in mid

1033
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:46,060
June. And if you look at the course

1034
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:49,312
website, there's this subsidiary

1035
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:51,910
website for interactive Q and A.

1036
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,700
And I invite everyone to post questions

1037
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:59,496
and discuss them and hope that

1038
00:51:59,518 --> 00:52:02,680
we'll have an interesting exchange and

1039
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:06,328
that everyone

1040
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,552
will come to sort of an understanding of

1041
00:52:08,606 --> 00:52:11,044
what was talked about today through

1042
00:52:11,102 --> 00:52:15,292
discussion. And we'll be interested

1043
00:52:15,426 --> 00:52:18,492
in being back in June to see how to

1044
00:52:18,546 --> 00:52:21,244
formulate this in quantum theory. So

1045
00:52:21,282 --> 00:52:23,212
thank you very much and thank you again,

1046
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:26,204
Daniel, for organizing this and hosting

1047
00:52:26,252 --> 00:52:28,544
it and putting together all the

1048
00:52:28,582 --> 00:52:30,736
technical things necessary to pull this

1049
00:52:30,758 --> 00:52:33,570
off. I could never do that on my own.

1050
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,550
Thank you. We're really excited here.

1051
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,808
Any closing thoughts? Or andrew, I'd

1052
00:52:41,824 --> 00:52:44,292
love to hear your reflection just

1053
00:52:44,346 --> 00:52:47,540
briefly. How would you have told that

1054
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,988
history or how does that history reflect

1055
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:52,570
on the areas that you're familiar with?

1056
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,890
Well, I don't think I have much to add.

1057
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,276
I've been mainly interested in the weak

1058
00:53:02,308 --> 00:53:05,404
rotation part. I'm excited to hear more

1059
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:09,150
about that, Chris. But no,

1060
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,620
I found this to be a very nice summary.

1061
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,368
I'm less familiar with the staff on

1062
00:53:16,454 --> 00:53:18,268
computation, formal computation,

1063
00:53:18,364 --> 00:53:20,064
despite being a mathematician by

1064
00:53:20,102 --> 00:53:23,888
training, it was a

1065
00:53:23,894 --> 00:53:25,296
little more familiar with all the

1066
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:27,876
physics stuff, but yeah, I thought it

1067
00:53:27,898 --> 00:53:31,508
was great. Thank you. All right.

1068
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:33,924
Thank you. I will close it. So in about

1069
00:53:33,962 --> 00:53:35,732
two weeks, we'll have the first

1070
00:53:35,786 --> 00:53:38,272
discussion. Everyone's welcome to join.

1071
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:41,188
I will share with Honor and Chris the

1072
00:53:41,274 --> 00:53:43,156
questions, and we can develop that. And

1073
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,764
we'll have that on the course, front end

1074
00:53:45,962 --> 00:53:48,532
before the coming discussion. So thanks

1075
00:53:48,586 --> 00:53:50,500
again, fellows. See you next time.
