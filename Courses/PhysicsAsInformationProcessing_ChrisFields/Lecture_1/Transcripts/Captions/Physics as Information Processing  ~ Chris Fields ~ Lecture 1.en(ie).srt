00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,340
hello and welcome everyone to the active

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,219
inference Institute this is session one

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,500
of the course physics as information

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,139
processing with Chris fields

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,960
first we'll have Andre Aguirre and Chris

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,000
Fields introduce themselves and then

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,460
we'll carry on with the first lecture

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,939
here check out the video description for

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,519
a link to the course overview website

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,759
where you can ask questions that will be

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,219
answered asynchronously register to

12
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,559
participate in the discussions which

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,079
happen about two weeks after each of the

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,840
six lecture sessions and just learn more

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,140
about this area so thank you both so

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,680
much for joining into this adventure we

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,860
are starting now and first please Andre

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,960
Aguirre introduce yourself and then

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,640
Chris introduction and lecture thank you

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,739
uh hello so I'll be the course assistant

21
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,120
and

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,879
um

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,520
specializing in probability and I have a

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,780
deep interest in the physics of

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,680
information

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,140
and I've been uh familiar with Chris's

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,180
papers for a while yeah so yeah just

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,900
here to learn myself

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,380
uh thank you Andrew and thank you Daniel

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,699
um I'm Chris fields

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,200
and uh I'll be presenting this course in

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,000
six sessions

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,060
and uh Andrew will be organizing

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,600
discussion sessions after each of those

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,540
and all of this is explained on the

36
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,900
course website

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,900
so uh let's start

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,240
this is a course on physics's

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,159
information processing

40
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,880
and this first session will be a

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,280
historical perspective

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,060
on the idea that physics is

43
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,320
is or is about information processing

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,598
and I'll just start with a few

45
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,180
quotations that span the middle of the

46
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,319
20th century from Wittgenstein and

47
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,360
1920 saying the world is all that is the

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,819
case so defining the world in terms of

49
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,879
facts not objects

50
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,660
a land hour in the early 60s proclaiming

51
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,360
that information is physical

52
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,020
and then uh John Archibald wheeler who

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,540
in many ways is the grandfather of this

54
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,480
era recently

55
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,980
um stating it is it from bit so uh

56
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,980
things come from information I.E bit

57
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,620
strings

58
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,379
and if nothing else this shows that that

59
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,080
formulations of this idea get pithier as

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,440
the 20th century rolls on

61
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,420
but the history goes uh back further

62
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,760
clearly than the 20th century

63
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
that I'm only going to really talk about

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,040
a piece of it

65
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
and

66
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,340
um the timeline that I'll actually

67
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,760
discuss today the the most relevant

68
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,860
history of this idea

69
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,200
goes back to the mid 19th century

70
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,140
and the first specific

71
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,940
thing I'll talk about is clausius's

72
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,879
definition of entropy

73
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,800
but with the beginning of the

74
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,379
understanding of thermodynamics and the

75
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,560
role of information in thermodynamics

76
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,280
you get this very interesting

77
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,120
multi-disciplinary progression of ideas

78
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,739
that incorporates the beginning of

79
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,260
quantum theory

80
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:52,799
um

81
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,739
and the the beginning of quantum theory

82
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,620
can kind of be dated to the the first

83
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,060
Solvay conference in 1928 and the famous

84
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,819
debate between Boren Einstein

85
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,340
over whether quantum theory is about

86
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,220
knowledge information or objects things

87
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,238
uh but it incorporates a lot of work in

88
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,459
computer science and logic and

89
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,800
Mathematics so interestingly computer

90
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,180
science

91
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,800
was born effectively in the mid 30s with

92
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,080
the work of church and Turing

93
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,020
which very rapidly converged with the

94
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,540
work in physics so today we'll be

95
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,759
talking about both computer science and

96
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,520
physics

97
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,560
and then in the second half of the 20th

98
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,320
century this just exploded into a huge

99
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,940
area

100
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,740
and in consequence of that mid 20th

101
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,500
century development we're beginning to

102
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,100
see a new idea about physics

103
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,800
which is roughly encapsulated in Quantum

104
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,419
information Theory

105
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,960
and the new idea is this it's that what

106
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,780
physics is actually about

107
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,240
is information transfer across

108
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,300
boundaries

109
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,940
and the information we can represent the

110
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,600
information transfer like this and this

111
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,139
is a conventional use a boundary is

112
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,919
always a blue ellipse

113
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,500
and the Agents that are exchanging

114
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,720
information across this boundary are

115
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,820
conventionally called Alice and Bob

116
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,039
which is just a more polite way of

117
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,500
saying A and B

118
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,300
and when you think about uh this picture

119
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,639
it becomes clear that what physics is

120
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,060
really about is communication

121
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,199
and this is a a wild redescription of

122
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,620
the idea of what physics is compared to

123
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,539
of the ideas of Newton or LaPlace or

124
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,120
even the 19th century ideas

125
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,300
and it's very different from the idea

126
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,780
that's been preserved in

127
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,800
um

128
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,400
20th century physics

129
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,400
in the lineage of Einstein

130
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,139
and others who viewed classical physics

131
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,979
as in a sense of fundamental

132
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,199
um either as completely fundamental or

133
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,240
as a fundamental adjunct to quantum

134
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,560
theory

135
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,460
so this way of thinking about physics

136
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,520
is a very deeply Quantum theoretic way

137
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,680
of thinking about physics

138
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,340
and where we're going in this course uh

139
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,020
today is really

140
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,319
uh the how did this all happen it's the

141
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,660
origin story

142
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,960
and then in the next session I want to

143
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,060
discuss Quantum information Theory

144
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,560
explicitly

145
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,139
and in particular how quantum theory

146
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,300
makes this conclusion that physics is

147
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,220
about communication very simple and

148
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,319
obvious much more obvious than it is in

149
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,900
classical physics

150
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,120
where it takes work to to formulate this

151
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,319
idea

152
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,240
uh then in the next session we're going

153
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,280
to talk about semantics

154
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,580
and how observations become meaningful

155
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,639
to the agents who make them

156
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,340
and hence how actions become meaningful

157
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,280
to the agents who make them

158
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,940
then in August we'll talk about uh

159
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,080
communication Theory a little bit more

160
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,280
explicitly

161
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,740
and talk about how agents employ

162
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,699
multiple communication channels

163
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:46,380
when they're communicating

164
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,259
and you know this is this is obvious

165
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,060
when you think of people communicating

166
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,039
they not only talk to each other they

167
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,960
look at the same things they point to

168
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,900
things Etc so this is what I mean by

169
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,419
multiple communication channels

170
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,479
then in September we'll leverage that

171
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,539
discussion to talk about how space-time

172
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,660
actually emerges from communication and

173
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,340
this is one of the most important

174
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,960
aspects I think upon an information

175
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,840
Theory it provides us with a way of

176
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,639
viewing space-time as an emergent

177
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,199
phenomenon

178
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,240
that communication is what is

179
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,560
fundamental

180
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,259
in some ontological sense

181
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,860
and the Box in which it happens face

182
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,199
time is not

183
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,360
so the final session in October will

184
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,539
talk about applications to biology

185
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,020
via the free energy principle and future

186
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,479
directions both in physics and biology

187
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,159
and elsewhere

188
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,080
so it's going to be an interesting ride

189
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,120
I'm keeping

190
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,899
formalism to a minimum uh because we're

191
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,839
directing this toward the broad array of

192
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,700
people who are interested in active

193
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,839
inference

194
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,880
and who are involved with the active

195
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,800
inference Institute

196
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,000
and I would ask you to hold questions

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,320
because we have a lot to get through in

198
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,459
an hour

199
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,760
for the interactive discussion and for

200
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,640
the discussion forum

201
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,120
um so uh I hope I explain things well

202
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,480
enough that all of the concepts will be

203
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,920
understandable

204
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,100
uh if not

205
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,540
Wikipedia is actually a wonderful

206
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,279
resource in this area for just

207
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,320
definitions of terms

208
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,080
so if there's anything that that just a

209
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,260
term that is is a trip up uh try

210
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,120
Wikipedia it's probably a very good

211
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,279
source for what these terms mean

212
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,860
so let's start

213
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,839
um our story as I said begins in the

214
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,300
19th century and in the mid 19th century

215
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,920
lots of physicists were devoting their

216
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,540
efforts to figuring out how to make

217
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,760
better steam engines

218
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,220
and

219
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,040
uh one question that arises when you're

220
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,399
trying to design a steam engine is what

221
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,500
happens physically

222
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,380
when you add heat to a system at

223
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,820
constant temperature so if you're

224
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,380
building a steam engine you've got a

225
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,720
boiler because you need to make Steam

226
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,760
and as you turn up the heat to your

227
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,899
boiler

228
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,240
you get more steam but the temperature

229
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,320
doesn't change so this is a mystery uh

230
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,500
what what is the heat actually adding to

231
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,180
the boiler

232
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,279
that is

233
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,700
not increasing the temperature

234
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,459
and

235
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:41,040
clausius responded to this question in a

236
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,779
way that's sort of typical for a

237
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,839
physicist or a mathematician

238
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,100
since he didn't know what the answer was

239
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,740
he just invented a new name for whatever

240
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,680
it was and gave it a formal definition

241
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,860
so he called it entropy which is a

242
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,560
made-up word that if it was translated

243
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,779
from the Greek would roughly mean

244
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,320
transformation content

245
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,899
in Trophy

246
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:10,260
and he represented it by a simple

247
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,339
equation that the change in this uh New

248
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,519
Concept entropy which is always called s

249
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,120
is just equal to the change in heat Q

250
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,820
at constant temperature t

251
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,000
so this obviously this equation just

252
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,160
reformulates the question in declarative

253
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,800
form saying whatever this stuff is

254
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,440
uh it's

255
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,040
it's changes in this stuff are just

256
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,860
changes in heated constant temperature

257
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,079
well heat is energy

258
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,660
and this wasn't completely recognized in

259
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,399
the mid 19th century

260
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,160
but the way you'll see this equation in

261
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,980
a current textbook is DS is the it

262
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,320
energy change in energy at constant

263
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,339
temperature

264
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,560
so even more commonly you would see it

265
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,200
written as the change in energy is equal

266
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,120
to the temperature times the change in

267
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,620
the entropy

268
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,019
it's the most common sort of textbook

269
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,019
way of seeing this but the question of

270
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,540
course is what is this quantity what is

271
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,380
this entropy what does this concept mean

272
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,399
and about 15 years after clausius

273
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,820
proposed it boltzmann had the key

274
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,500
insight

275
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,320
which is that entropy is a measurement

276
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
of our uncertainty about the state the

277
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,380
system is in

278
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,320
and in particular

279
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,440
oh he again of course went to formalism

280
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,839
and said the entropy s

281
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,079
is equal to some constant

282
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,160
uh times the number of states that the

283
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,220
system can be in that look the same to

284
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,720
us

285
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,060
and since that number of states is

286
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,700
enormous the way to make that manageable

287
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,100
is take to take the log of the number of

288
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,000
states so the natural log is is Ln

289
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and this constant K is called

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,760
Boltzmann's constant

291
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,320
and

292
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,139
boltzmann was able to do this because he

293
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,480
subscribed to a radical and very

294
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,459
unpopular Theory

295
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:24,899
of that material things uh including

296
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,720
gases like air were made of atoms

297
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,740
and heat made the atoms move around

298
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,139
and as you increase the amount of heat

299
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,880
the atoms can move in many different

300
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,940
ways so the number of states that they

301
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,980
can be in that look the same to us

302
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,980
increases and that's what entropy is

303
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,959
it's this increase in the number of

304
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,560
states that the system can be in uh that

305
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,600
all look the same to us with the

306
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,220
measurements that we can make and since

307
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,500
they look the same to us we're uncertain

308
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,800
about exactly what state they're in

309
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,959
so so entropy is a measure of

310
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,940
uncertainty

311
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,339
this was really the beginning of modern

312
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,720
physics

313
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
oh because

314
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,920
what it says now

315
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,220
is that decreasing uncertainty requires

316
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,100
energy it links a measurement of

317
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,519
uncertainty to a measurement of energy

318
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,500
and if you think about the uncertainty

319
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,420
principle in quantum theory

320
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,180
how the core idea of the uncertainty

321
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,639
principle is you can't measure a system

322
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,100
without disturbing it

323
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,380
so to actually act on a system requires

324
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,600
energy and that's what you have to do to

325
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,399
get information

326
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,160
so here's boltzmann basically inventing

327
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,060
quantum theory

328
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,320
so we're going to fast forward by

329
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,920
another 15 years to 1900

330
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,880
and in 1900 Planck solved this problem

331
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,920
called the black body radiation problem

332
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,019
which was basically how much heat does

333
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,579
your hot boiler give off into the air

334
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:07,860
and of all of the measurements of the

335
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,959
heat that hot boilers gave off to the

336
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,660
air ran into problems in classical

337
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,760
physics and caused contradictions and

338
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,199
quantities that went to infinity and all

339
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,079
that was bad so many people were trying

340
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,079
to solve this problem and Planck solved

341
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,779
it by making a simple postulate he said

342
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,240
the energy of the radiation

343
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,420
is proportional to its frequency so its

344
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,940
color in the case of light

345
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,120
and if you go higher frequency you end

346
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,940
up in ultraviolet and x-rays and gamma

347
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,800
rays if you've got a lower frequency you

348
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,199
go into microwaves and radio and all of

349
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,120
that

350
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,100
so this is a nice way of talking about

351
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,620
radiation and it turned out that this

352
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,660
solved the problem I mean just assuming

353
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,600
this simple proportionality relationship

354
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,060
uh produced Spectra for black body

355
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,339
radiation that worked that matched what

356
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,260
you saw experimentally

357
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,120
well this means something very important

358
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,880
it means because this number H the

359
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,740
proportionality constant called Plex

360
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,940
constant is a number it's finite it

361
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,740
means that energy comes in discrete

362
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,920
units of H you can have one H or two H

363
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,500
or 10 million H but you can't have half

364
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,320
an H of energy

365
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,980
um

366
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,740
so it's quantized and this is widely

367
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,660
recognized as the birth of quantum

368
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,860
theory

369
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,899
but of course we should have known this

370
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,380
already if we just thought a little bit

371
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,320
right we know that that changes of

372
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,459
energy

373
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,160
are proportional to the changes in

374
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,420
entropy

375
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,699
uh by temperature

376
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,880
and we know that that entropy is a

377
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,519
measure of the number of states

378
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,759
and numbers of states are just numbers

379
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,100
you can have one state two states three

380
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,860
states 10 million States 100 billion

381
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,359
States but they're all just a number

382
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,880
uh one up

383
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,220
and it's not infinite there's not an

384
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,079
infinite number of states unless you

385
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,459
have an infinite amount of energy which

386
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,020
you don't have

387
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,079
so we knew already that entropy could

388
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,419
only take discrete values

389
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,280
and since energy and entropy are

390
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,140
basically the same thing we knew already

391
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,660
that energy could only take discrete

392
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,940
values

393
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,240
so we could have realized in 1900 that

394
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,280
energy is quantized because the number

395
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,919
of states is quantized

396
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,799
uh so it shouldn't have really been a

397
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,200
mystery why energy was quantitis but it

398
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,539
was a mystery and it stayed a mystery

399
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,160
it's I mean it's in a sits still a

400
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,900
mystery people still debate the meaning

401
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,919
of quantum theory

402
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,660
but another thing we could have known in

403
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,020
1900 was something very important

404
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,760
and it's that this Quantum of action of

405
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,340
Planck's constant which has units of

406
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,520
action which is energy times time

407
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,100
is intimately related to Boltzmann's

408
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,679
constant

409
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:17,700
uh and Boltzmann's constant has of

410
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,500
units of energy over temperature

411
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,000
but this wasn't actually understood

412
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,299
until the 1950s

413
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:29,100
no one really figured that this out

414
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,820
there was this relation until the 1950s

415
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,140
and when it was figured out it was

416
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,600
figured out by a guy named Giancarlo

417
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,740
Wick

418
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,080
and he introduced this notion of the

419
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,700
wick rotation

420
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,799
by realizing that if you have an

421
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,440
equation in classical physics

422
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,760
and in it there's the term 1 over KT

423
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,820
you can always replace that one over KT

424
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,760
with this other expression i t over H

425
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,179
bar H bar is just H divided by 2 pi

426
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,039
and you'll get an equation that's valid

427
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,960
in quantum theory

428
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,059
and this is typically described in

429
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:09,360
textbooks as a trick and whenever

430
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,400
something in physics is described as a

431
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,380
trick what that really means is it's

432
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,039
something we don't understand

433
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:19,140
uh and lots of papers have been written

434
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,500
about the meaning of the wick rotation

435
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,320
um but to start to understand the wick

436
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,700
rotation

437
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,400
I want to look at this equation a little

438
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,360
bit

439
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,620
of

440
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,440
1 over KT is 1 over in energy

441
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,960
and I T over H bar is 1 over an energy

442
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,080
since h-bar is units of energy times

443
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,580
time

444
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,059
uh we have time in this equation

445
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,760
and then we have this factor I

446
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,100
which is typically thought of as just an

447
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,799
imaginary number so it's the square root

448
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,600
of -1

449
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,240
and what's this I doing in this equation

450
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,000
and in fact you see factors of i t over

451
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,740
H bar if you're familiar with quantum

452
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,720
theory everywhere

453
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,940
in quantum theory

454
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,760
so what's the meaning of this imaginary

455
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,220
number

456
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,660
and

457
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,440
if you just think of i t or or of i as

458
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,140
this arbitrary imaginary number that

459
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,039
somehow renders the equation mysterious

460
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:31,740
then the whole whole of quantum theory

461
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,600
is mysterious but the wick rotation is

462
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,280
very mysterious

463
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,960
but what I is actually is an operator

464
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,039
and if you think of the real numbers as

465
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,200
an axis which is always drawn

466
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,100
horizontally so here it is here's zero

467
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,740
and the axis is pointing that way I'm

468
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,360
sorry I can't get the camera really far

469
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,520
enough away to see my arm here

470
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,320
so what is I I is actually an operator

471
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,380
that rotates the whole real axis by 90

472
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,760
degrees

473
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,880
so if you if you see a plot of complex

474
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,740
numbers and the real numbers go this way

475
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,900
and the quote imaginary numbers go that

476
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,780
way so what multiplying by I is done is

477
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,880
rotate by 90 degrees

478
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,160
and of course if you do I squared you

479
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,320
rotate twice by 90 degrees my arm will

480
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,539
do this but you end up pointing that way

481
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,940
and those are the negative numbers

482
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,179
so I as an operator that rotates

483
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:33,120
something by 90 degrees and if you

484
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,700
rotate four times by 90 degrees you're

485
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,559
back to the identity

486
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:41,039
so I to the fourth is one

487
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,960
so this tells us something very

488
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,360
interesting which is that what the wick

489
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,240
rotation is really talking about is a

490
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,860
rotation

491
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,280
it's a geometrical equation

492
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,020
and in July we'll come back to this and

493
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,539
really probe what this Wick rotation

494
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:04,280
means physically

495
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,419
um but

496
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,520
as I said this wasn't understood to the

497
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,120
1950s and by the 1950s a lot had

498
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,020
happened

499
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,940
so quantum theory have been developed

500
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,919
boring Einstein had had their debate

501
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,080
particle accelerators had built the

502
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,240
atomic bomb had been built Nuclear

503
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,360
Physics as well in its way

504
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,799
um so

505
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,860
an enormous amount of practical physics

506
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,559
had been done quantum theory was highly

507
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,179
developed people were starting to think

508
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,460
about Quantum field Theory before they

509
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,220
made this this simple realization that's

510
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,740
formulated in the wick rotation

511
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,780
so this is a heartbreaker of things to

512
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,679
come

513
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,620
but before we continue in physics we

514
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,840
need to backtrack and time a little bit

515
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,539
and look at what the mathematicians were

516
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,280
doing

517
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,960
so across the hall in the math

518
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,020
department one year after the Solvay

519
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,520
conference in 1929 uh Kurt girdle proved

520
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,460
his famous first in completeness theorem

521
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,500
and the theorem states that no formal

522
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,539
system that contains arithmetic can be

523
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:12,600
both consistent and complete

524
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,720
and that means that either there are

525
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,000
true statements that aren't provable in

526
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,240
the in the formal system

527
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,400
or there are false statements that are

528
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,600
provable or of course both

529
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,039
and girdles

530
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,740
proof is is actually extremely simple

531
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,760
almost all of the work in the proof

532
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,760
is setting up all of the notation and

533
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,460
procedures and so forth to formulate

534
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,500
within arithmetic

535
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,100
uh the sentence this sentence is not

536
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,960
provable

537
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,120
and once you have that sentence

538
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,600
formulated within arithmetic then the

539
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,700
conclusion of the proof is is obvious

540
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,860
you know if you can prove the sentence

541
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,799
this sentence is not provable then

542
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,200
you've proved something that's false

543
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,539
and if you can't prove it then there's

544
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,280
then there's sentences that you can't

545
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,980
prove uh in arithmetic

546
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,260
so this was incredibly bad news for

547
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,640
mathematicians

548
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,159
who thought that finite discrete

549
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,740
operations which is what proofs are and

550
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,260
also what computations are can

551
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,900
exhaustively enumerate the facts and

552
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,200
this was the Assumption behind

553
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,340
wittgenstein's claim that

554
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,799
the world is all that is the case the

555
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,900
world is a collection of facts

556
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,840
and optimistically he thought that first

557
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,940
order logic would allow us to enumerate

558
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,280
all those facts and we'd be done

559
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,299
dreams of a final Theory again

560
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:47,760
um so so girdles there means that no

561
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,700
system with finite capabilities no

562
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,500
system that can just do find out

563
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
discrete operations can fully describe

564
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,679
its environment it will always be in an

565
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,539
environment where there are two things

566
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,760
that aren't provable or false things

567
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,980
that are provable

568
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,620
but I think more relative to a

569
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,480
discussion of Agents is that it means

570
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,559
that no agent can describe itself uh any

571
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,960
agent's theory of itself

572
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,960
will either contain true statements that

573
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,520
it can't derive

574
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,100
or false statements or it will either

575
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,140
mystery statements that it can't derive

576
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,240
or it will end up deriving things that

577
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,340
are false about itself

578
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,740
of course we see this in Psychology all

579
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,539
the time

580
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:36,360
so an immediate consequence of girdle's

581
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,880
theorem was an intense investigation of

582
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,520
what computation actually is what it

583
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,440
meant to talk about finite discrete

584
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,880
operations

585
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,820
and two leaders of this were of course

586
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,620
church and Turing and here's a picture

587
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,600
of a turing machine which is just a

588
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
little device with a couple of tapes and

589
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,100
a tape reader and a simple logic unit

590
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,980
that either writes or one or a zero if

591
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,440
it sees a one or a zero

592
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,620
and they defined a computation

593
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,440
as a process that can be implemented in

594
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,679
finite Time by such a machine or by

595
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,380
Church's Lambda calculus or buy any of

596
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,120
the now hundreds of other methods that

597
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,860
are provably equivalent to a turing

598
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,059
machine

599
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,220
so what does this mean

600
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,039
it means that computation is a physical

601
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,620
process that can be mechanized and it

602
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,960
turns out mechanized in any one of a

603
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,000
huge array of ways

604
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,740
it means that many different

605
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,500
implementations of any computation are

606
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,360
possible so I can do it on a turing

607
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,880
machine I can do it on my laptop I can

608
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,400
do it in my head Etc

609
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,200
the most important things it means is

610
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,520
that there are questions with no

611
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,980
computable answer this is the Revenge of

612
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,600
girdle's theorem

613
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,760
and two of the most famous questions of

614
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,460
this kind are given some arbitrary

615
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,740
program will it halt will it will it get

616
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,820
to an answer in finite time and that the

617
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,320
answer to that question is this is

618
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,640
undecidable

619
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,299
no procedure can figure this out

620
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:08,520
and the other the other

621
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,799
undecidable question

622
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,020
is given some arbitrary program what

623
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,179
function does it compute

624
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:16,740
and you'd think that would be simple

625
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,659
that you can read a program and figure

626
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:21,539
out what function it computes but it

627
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,299
turns out that is undecidable that

628
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:29,220
cannot be done by any finite process

629
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,840
so

630
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,620
this was a another body blow to the goal

631
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,220
of of understanding everything with uh

632
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,279
finite discrete processes but it also

633
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,279
set the stage for something new it set

634
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,220
the stage for thinking about an agent

635
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,559
who interacts with a computational

636
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,000
process

637
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,120
by giving it an input and then looking

638
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,039
at its output sometime later

639
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,419
and this of course will look familiar

640
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,460
because I've included the blue ellipse

641
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,620
which is the boundary which these days

642
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,500
we call a user interface

643
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,919
and the user interface just allows some

644
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:14,340
finite action on the system and then the

645
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,679
ability to observe some finite response

646
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,299
by the system

647
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,460
so we can now ask what can Alice

648
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,820
determine by acting in some finite way

649
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,460
and then making some finite number of

650
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,460
observations I.E

651
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,559
receiving some finite number of outputs

652
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,539
from the system that she's acting on

653
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:39,299
and the first 20 years of this produced

654
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:41,640
a large number of answers all of them

655
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,059
negative so to go back to touring he

656
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,820
proved that Alice can't tell what's

657
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,919
implementing the function that she sees

658
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,360
being implemented

659
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,200
uh she can't tell whether a given input

660
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,539
will lead to an output that's the

661
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,400
halting problem

662
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,880
Oh Shannon showed that Alice can't tell

663
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,000
what the inputs mean to the system

664
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,940
of his whole theory of communication is

665
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,840
completely independent of semantics

666
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,299
and his theory of communication actually

667
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,640
accurately describes what Alice can

668
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,320
observe

669
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,940
uh rice is the one who proved that you

670
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,039
can't determine what program is

671
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,179
generating

672
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,940
the outputs

673
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,460
and then Moore proved a very similar

674
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,559
result in a completely different formal

675
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,720
setting of general cybernetics that you

676
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,399
can't tell what process is generating

677
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,240
the outputs by finite observation

678
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,120
look what Alice can do is build a

679
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,480
predictive model of what generates the

680
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,520
output she sees in response to her

681
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,159
inputs and test it by designing new

682
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,299
inputs

683
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:58,380
and this is of course as as Carl popper

684
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,440
told us the process that we call science

685
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,440
so owls can do science even though she

686
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,480
can't answer any of these fundamental

687
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,779
questions

688
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,940
now this of course has a huge

689
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,460
technological consequence

690
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,559
uh

691
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,059
since

692
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:21,720
this theory of computation tells us that

693
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,620
processes are effectively virtual

694
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,440
uh we we don't know what they are and we

695
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,899
can't determine what they are except in

696
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:33,480
theory by making the theory

697
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,240
uh technologically it means we're free

698
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,480
to use virtualization everywhere because

699
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,480
we have to deal with it anyway

700
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,940
and this allows us to build multi-level

701
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,860
architectures it means that we can

702
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,799
architect computers where no layer of

703
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:52,380
the computation has any idea what's

704
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,960
going on below or above it and doesn't

705
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,880
need to

706
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,220
uh and that's what makes practical

707
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,659
programming possible so from these no-go

708
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,899
theorems that tell you what you can't do

709
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:11,159
you actually get an enormous boost into

710
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,539
it

711
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,220
and use

712
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,220
to probe the world and develop theories

713
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,940
and on and on and on

714
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,240
so in a sense girdle birthed not only

715
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,940
computer science but practical Computing

716
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,940
by showing us that virtualization is

717
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,820
just the way the world works so now

718
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,919
let's go back to physics

719
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:37,760
where these ideas were were

720
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,380
replicated basically reintroduced

721
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,860
reinvented by Feynman

722
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,200
in developing his path integral

723
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,539
formulation of quantum theory

724
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,080
and basically what Hyman realized was

725
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,500
that in any physical process

726
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,000
of The Observer Alice prepares some

727
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,279
state that she's interested in she

728
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:05,120
prepares some input to an experiment

729
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,279
then she lets something happen

730
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,860
and then she sees what the result of the

731
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,360
experiment is

732
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,940
and the canonical experiment in physics

733
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,480
is scattering you you you know fire two

734
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,520
protons at each other and they intersect

735
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,740
someplace and stuff comes out and you

736
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,860
measure this stuff that comes out

737
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,419
and

738
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:30,000
what you can measure is momentum and

739
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,600
spin energy things like that position

740
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,940
so

741
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,120
these processes

742
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,980
conserve the total values of the things

743
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,020
you can measure so in particular they

744
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,600
preserve momentum and angular momentum

745
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,240
and they preserve you know other things

746
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,500
that

747
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,899
that are harder to measure and are only

748
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,700
approximately conserved anyway like

749
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,380
lepton number

750
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,740
uh but feynman's contribution to this

751
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,500
way of thinking about experiments was to

752
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,600
say look if you want to understand the

753
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,500
output

754
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,539
you have to sum over all of the possible

755
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:11,220
processes that could have produced the

756
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,159
output from the input no matter how

757
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,620
improbable they are

758
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,100
so the the famous idea for refinement

759
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,039
diagrams is if you have an electron

760
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,380
that's scattering off an atom

761
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,140
oh you measure the initial state of the

762
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,360
electron that you've generated with an

763
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,820
accelerator or something and you measure

764
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,980
the final state which involves momentum

765
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,980
and spin and so forth and for all you

766
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,360
knew

767
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,840
uh part way through the process the

768
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,960
electron disappeared and an entire

769
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,740
universe appeared and then annihilated

770
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,340
with a copy of an entire anti-universe

771
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,500
and the electron came back out

772
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,539
uh and you have to include processes

773
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,159
like that if you really want to

774
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,039
understand and correctly predict the

775
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,260
outcomes of your measurements

776
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,159
and uh Murray Galvan

777
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:10,440
lifted does the bumper sticker slogan

778
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,480
from th White and The Once and Future

779
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,480
King everything not explicitly forbidden

780
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,639
is mandatory that sums up feynman's idea

781
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,320
and this is called the totalitarian

782
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,960
principle since it's what's written in

783
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,540
th White's book on the kingdom of the

784
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,780
ants for which everything not explicitly

785
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,139
forbidden is mandatory

786
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:36,780
so let's think about a real example uh

787
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,480
that's a bit uh actually it's the same

788
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,339
as scattering the ultimate scattering

789
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,480
experiment

790
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,780
uh in physics is a black hole

791
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,099
uh stuff goes into the Horizon of stars

792
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,500
whole galaxies whatever

793
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,480
something happens

794
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,480
and stuff comes out and what comes out

795
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,640
is hawking radiation

796
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,440
and

797
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,859
uh information is conserved if the

798
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,900
information in the Hawking radiation is

799
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,119
actually the same as the information and

800
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,760
the stuff that went in

801
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,020
and conservation is not qualitative it's

802
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,660
quantitative it's only the quantity of

803
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,220
information that's supposed to be

804
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,720
preserved

805
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,540
and you can ask how much

806
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,240
is the information that's being emitted

807
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,460
by a black hole that's emitting Hawking

808
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,960
radiation

809
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,320
and beckenstein was the one who figured

810
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,480
this out using an incredibly simple

811
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,859
argument

812
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:41,040
but I'll just give the answer here the

813
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,079
answer is that the total entropy of the

814
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,460
black hole

815
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,780
is its area divided by four

816
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,099
and the area in this equation has to be

817
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:55,440
computed in Planck units which are units

818
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,200
where Planck's Constant and the speed of

819
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,599
light in Boltzmann's Constant and other

820
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,339
interesting things are all set equal to

821
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:03,800
one

822
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,099
so one plank area is the plank length

823
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,200
squared which turns out to be about 10

824
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,560
to the minus 70th meters squared

825
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,900
so this says that black holes are the

826
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,900
most entropic entities we know of

827
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,380
so a black hole about this big

828
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,800
with a radius of about a meter as an

829
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,339
entropy of about 10 to the 70th

830
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,980
which is of course an astonishingly big

831
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,960
number

832
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,619
and uh a black hole uh

833
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:41,160
with the area of the Sun so a moderate

834
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,280
sized cosmological black hole a real

835
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,619
thing that we can observe with you know

836
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,020
a gravity wave telescope or something

837
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,740
has an entropy of about 10 to the 79th

838
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,619
and really big black holes which are

839
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,320
bigger than the entire solar system have

840
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,079
entropies into the 10 to the 80th

841
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,099
uh you know 10 to the 85th or something

842
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,800
so these are enormously entropic

843
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,140
entities

844
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,980
um

845
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,040
but beckenstein didn't just tell us that

846
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,500
he told us something about the structure

847
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,099
of the interface The Horizon of a black

848
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:21,420
hole

849
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,359
and this is what he told us

850
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:26,820
oh

851
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,940
you can compute entropy and debts just

852
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,640
by using uh

853
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,640
log Space 2 instead of logs based e

854
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,260
natural logs

855
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,740
and that's just inter me multiplying the

856
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,760
natural log by about 1.4

857
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,020
so

858
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,000
we can write the entropy of black hole

859
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,060
of black hole in units of bits and it's

860
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,760
about a over six

861
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,119
so what does this mean to say that we

862
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,520
can think of the entropy in terms of

863
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,660
bits

864
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,940
what it says is that we can think of the

865
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,079
interface

866
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,380
in terms of a bit array

867
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,420
and we can think of all of these bits

868
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,880
as encoded on

869
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,920
this interface

870
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:24,020
at a density of one bit every roughly uh

871
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,960
six plank lengths of squared six plank

872
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,839
areas so this is an incredibly dense

873
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,300
encoding in a black hole

874
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,180
oh and it's and it's an interesting idea

875
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,520
about black holes but what gets really

876
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,500
interesting is what happens when you

877
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,440
generalize it and of course physicists

878
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,960
are run to generalization and that's

879
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,660
what happened next

880
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,980
um

881
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,380
uh Gerard to hooft almost immediately

882
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,359
thereafter on the basis that beckon's

883
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,460
team's work formulated the holographic

884
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,720
principle

885
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,599
and what the holographic principle says

886
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,880
is we can think of any

887
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,420
system is approximately a black hole

888
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,060
oh and the only approximation is the

889
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,560
encoding density

890
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,460
of the boundary of any system

891
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,280
encodes the information that we can get

892
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,260
about the system

893
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,140
uh at some density and the density is

894
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,420
less than the density for a black hole

895
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,000
because we're not black holes

896
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,780
uh and this rules out a lot by limiting

897
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,700
the amount of information that you can

898
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,560
extract from a system

899
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,540
to the amount of information that you

900
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,839
can actually write on its boundary

901
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,700
and one of the things that it rules out

902
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,700
is knowing the geometry on the inside of

903
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,520
the system and to put it this way which

904
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,839
I I think is a brilliant thought

905
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,460
experiment he says look

906
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,579
the metric inside this system can be so

907
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:55,280
curved

908
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,720
effectively the space time inside the

909
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,760
system is can be so curved that you

910
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,280
could stick an entire universe inside

911
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,500
and we never know because it wouldn't

912
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,200
change the amount of of entropy the

913
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,119
number of bits that are encoded on the

914
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,740
boundary

915
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,680
so the inside geometry can be anything

916
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,260
and you can't find out by looking at the

917
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,500
outside of the system

918
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,420
now the holographic principle

919
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,619
almost follows from classical physics oh

920
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:26,820
there's

921
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,700
Euler's theorem which which tells you

922
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,720
about 1 over r squared forces

923
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,480
and you can think of the forces

924
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,380
penetrating the boundary at some

925
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,160
density

926
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,160
and the difference between

927
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,560
Euler's theorem and the holographic

928
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,020
principle is just that the density in

929
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,900
classical physics can go to Infinity

930
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,500
and in the holographic principle it can

931
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,680
only go to this maximal density that's

932
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,599
achieved by a black hole

933
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,119
why because if you try to get any higher

934
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,280
and more information the information

935
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,040
gets sucked into the black hole and you

936
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,200
can't get it out

937
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,339
um

938
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:13,820
so the holographic principle

939
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,579
becomes a guiding principle for thinking

940
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,040
about any physical system

941
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,740
and what it means to extract information

942
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,320
from a physical system

943
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,260
and in fact we'll talk about this next

944
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,619
time you can say exactly what the

945
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,540
information encoded on the boundary of

946
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,660
any system is

947
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,780
of and uh well I'll go through next time

948
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,900
is is seeing that uh the information

949
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,300
that's encoded on the boundary is a

950
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,640
specification of the the energy that's

951
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,619
being exchanged by the by the

952
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:52,200
interaction which of course is linear in

953
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,480
the number of bits it's just counting

954
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,119
the number of bits

955
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,440
okay

956
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,880
so

957
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,339
with the holographic principle we now

958
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:05,400
have a complete new science about

959
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,160
systems that are exchanging

960
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,280
of finite discrete information across a

961
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,000
boundary by encoding that information on

962
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,579
the boundary and then reading the

963
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,280
information off the boundary

964
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,940
so here's a new way of thinking about

965
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,920
physical interaction

966
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,500
Alice writes a message on her boundary

967
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,000
with Bob

968
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,820
and Bob reads the message

969
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,500
off the boundary

970
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,480
and then writes his own new message

971
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,079
which Alice then reads and of course

972
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,839
that's what's happening right now

973
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:47,040
I'm writing information by speaking

974
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,220
on an interface which is effectively the

975
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,800
internet and you're reading that

976
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,260
information off the internet by

977
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,380
listening to it and when we get time for

978
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,859
questions you'll be writing information

979
00:43:00,859 --> 00:43:05,280
on the internet which I'll be reading

980
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,859
now the key thing about this new science

981
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,260
is that it's topological it's about

982
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,119
connectivity

983
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:15,180
across some Communication channel which

984
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,880
we represent as a boundary it's not

985
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,560
geometric

986
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,900
so it doesn't assume anything about

987
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,000
space-time

988
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,640
so it allows us to

989
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,319
build a model of space in particular as

990
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,359
an emergent phenomenon

991
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:37,980
and it allows us to seek time as not

992
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,880
some absolute external abstraction

993
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,640
but something that the communicating

994
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,420
agents measure for themselves

995
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:53,099
and so they each Act in their own time

996
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:56,220
and we get a very natural measure of

997
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,520
time in terms of how many bits I see

998
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,319
coming across my boundary and again

999
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,240
we'll talk about that in the next couple

1000
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,700
of sessions

1001
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,900
um and then

1002
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,640
talk about it more thoroughly in

1003
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,440
September when we talk about emergent

1004
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,900
SpaceTime

1005
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,119
so Quantum information Theory looks very

1006
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,220
different from the physics that came

1007
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,740
before

1008
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,980
not because it's adopted a new formalism

1009
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,440
of the tools of quantum theory it's

1010
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,839
because it's entirely changed the

1011
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,780
thinking about what physics is and what

1012
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,099
it's about

1013
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:36,180
oh and replace this idea of forces and

1014
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,579
balls banging into each other and all of

1015
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,560
that with the idea of communication

1016
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,480
between agents

1017
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,800
and

1018
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,960
of course that's familiar from an active

1019
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,940
inference perspective

1020
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:52,140
so we can now uh back up a little bit to

1021
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,000
see what they were doing in classical

1022
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,640
physics during this period well let me

1023
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,099
let me go on a little bit sorry

1024
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,160
um

1025
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,980
this is this is just a slight quoting uh

1026
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,260
wheeler

1027
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,480
who of course is the most radical in

1028
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,020
terms of empathiest in terms of

1029
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,400
formulating these ideas

1030
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,400
but here's his characterization of this

1031
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,060
new physics uh it's not reductive

1032
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,740
uh all of the reasoning is circular

1033
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,020
you don't have smaller things and then

1034
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,480
yet smaller things and then yet smaller

1035
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,540
things forever

1036
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,339
there are no laws

1037
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:36,780
uh

1038
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,260
so what you see on the interface uh is a

1039
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,740
is a message it's not something that's

1040
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,140
governed by laws since the beginning of

1041
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,460
the universe

1042
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,339
uh there's no Continuum so there's no

1043
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:51,720
there's nothing described by real

1044
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,760
numbers it's all described by integers

1045
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,859
everything's done in finite dimensional

1046
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:57,119
spaces

1047
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,400
and finally and most importantly there's

1048
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,940
no space-time box in which things happen

1049
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,940
so think of how radical this is

1050
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,000
means there's no big bang

1051
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,099
there's no big rip

1052
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:13,800
there's no bouncing universe

1053
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,839
all of those ideas are out the window

1054
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,060
because they're classical and they're

1055
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,040
about space-time

1056
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,619
and what the new physics wants to do is

1057
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,099
derive space-time out of basically users

1058
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:28,920
experiences

1059
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,640
so the the agents here are all Observer

1060
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,480
participants in wheelers uh language but

1061
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,359
what that just means is Agents

1062
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,880
that that want to communicate and it's

1063
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,619
their communication that gives rise to

1064
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:45,960
physics

1065
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,460
so now we'll go back to classical

1066
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,780
physics

1067
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,839
and uh what was happening or one thing

1068
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,460
that was happening in classical physics

1069
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,680
at that time was a lot of thinking about

1070
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,599
uh stochastic causal Networks

1071
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,260
and um Pearl

1072
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,000
realize that if you have any stochastic

1073
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,900
causal Network that's unidirectional

1074
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:13,140
then around any node you can draw what

1075
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,300
he called a Markov blanket

1076
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,760
and a Marco blanket is just the set of

1077
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,800
nodes in the network that that

1078
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,319
absorb all outside causation and then

1079
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,480
transmit that causation into whatever

1080
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,339
node you're interested in

1081
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:32,099
and that absorb all causation coming

1082
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,140
from the node you're interested in and

1083
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,700
transmit it to

1084
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,680
the rest of the world

1085
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,420
and so we can redraw that in part D here

1086
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,940
and it should look very familiar a

1087
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,619
Markov blanket is just a classical

1088
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:48,540
physics way of talking about a

1089
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,640
holographic screen

1090
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,480
and the number of nodes in the Markov

1091
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,420
blanket or in particular the number of

1092
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,240
degrees of freedom times the number of

1093
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,000
nodes is just the number of bits that

1094
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,280
flow across that Markov blanket so it's

1095
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,680
the number of it's the entropy of the

1096
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,859
effective holographic screen

1097
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:13,800
so so this this all these ideas were

1098
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,020
reinvented more or less independently

1099
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,020
within classical physics

1100
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,020
and it was from this classical physics

1101
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,240
background

1102
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,579
that uh Carl Preston came up with the

1103
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,800
idea that a motor called blanket defines

1104
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,460
a persistent

1105
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,220
at least from an active inference

1106
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,140
Institute point of view everyone is

1107
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,359
familiar with because it's the

1108
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,160
foundation of the idea of active

1109
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,520
inference oh

1110
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,859
any system

1111
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:50,400
is that persists through time

1112
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,880
uh does so by making sure that it

1113
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,640
doesn't dissolve into its environment

1114
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,819
what does that mean it means it it

1115
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:02,400
persists Through Time by maintaining the

1116
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,339
Integrity of its Markov blanket or the

1117
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:07,740
Integrity of its boundary

1118
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,099
so this of course is just a tautology

1119
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:13,859
but it's a very it's a very interesting

1120
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:16,740
and very productive tautology

1121
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,579
because it says that any System is using

1122
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:22,740
the information it gets on its boundary

1123
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,500
from its environment to build a model of

1124
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,960
how its environment behaves

1125
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,400
and then

1126
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,339
it uses that model to act back on its

1127
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:36,420
environment to test and refine its model

1128
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,819
and again as popper to told us this is

1129
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:40,980
just what science is

1130
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,040
so what the free energy principle really

1131
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,040
tells us is that all systems are agents

1132
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,460
that are doing science all the time

1133
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,540
so physics is effectively uh not just

1134
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,819
the study of communication

1135
00:49:56,819 --> 00:50:00,599
but it's the study of uh agents doing

1136
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,599
science with each other pairs of agents

1137
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,680
who are trying to figure each other out

1138
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,839
by their communication and communicative

1139
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,300
exchanges

1140
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,560
so

1141
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,440
that's the history of how we got from

1142
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,140
1930s sorry 1850s thermodynamics

1143
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,540
to the free energy principle

1144
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,540
and

1145
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,720
how the free energy principle connects

1146
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,740
to these very deep and extremely radical

1147
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,260
especially within context

1148
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,740
ideas in quantum theory and Quantum

1149
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,220
cosmology and computer science all of

1150
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,839
which tell us

1151
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,599
that

1152
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,760
the world we see

1153
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,960
is a projection that's being written on

1154
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,500
our boundaries

1155
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,619
by a process that we have no access to

1156
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:05,880
accept the the procedure of active

1157
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,300
inference or the procedure of science

1158
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,599
which is to formulate predictive models

1159
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:15,540
and test them by doing things in the

1160
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,559
world

1161
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,240
and seeing how the world responds

1162
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,559
so uh that's it for this session

1163
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:27,240
of

1164
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,640
the first discussion session which

1165
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,280
Anders going to lead will be the 3rd of

1166
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,760
June at this same time uh I.E five

1167
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,099
o'clock European Time

1168
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:41,640
and then uh my session number two will

1169
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,619
be in mid-june

1170
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:46,819
and uh if you look at the course website

1171
00:51:46,819 --> 00:51:50,280
uh there's this subsidiary website for

1172
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,280
interactive q a

1173
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,700
and I invite everyone to post questions

1174
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,380
and uh discuss them

1175
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,540
and hope that we'll have an interesting

1176
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,920
Exchange

1177
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,910
and that

1178
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:04,200
[Music]

1179
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,819
um

1180
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:07,619
everyone will come to sort of an

1181
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:09,960
understanding of what uh was talked

1182
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,500
about today through discussion

1183
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,500
and will be uh interested in being back

1184
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,099
in June to see how to formulate this in

1185
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:22,079
quantum theory so thank you very much

1186
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,140
and and thank you again Daniel for

1187
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,359
organizing this and hosting it and

1188
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,099
putting together all the technical

1189
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:31,680
things necessary to pull this off

1190
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,200
I could never do that on my own

1191
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,160
what

1192
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,960
thank you we're really

1193
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,480
um excited here

1194
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,940
any closing thoughts or or Andrew I'd

1195
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,460
love to hear your reflection just

1196
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,960
briefly what

1197
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,420
how would you have told that history or

1198
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,819
how does that history reflect on the

1199
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:54,140
areas that you're familiar with

1200
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,280
well I I don't think that had much to do

1201
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,020
on I

1202
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:58,859
um

1203
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:01,920
I've been you know mainly interested in

1204
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,619
the week rotation part I I'm excited to

1205
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:07,400
hear more about that Chris

1206
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,220
uh but no I mean I I promise to be a

1207
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,900
very very nice summary I don't think I

1208
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,240
I'm less familiar with the

1209
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,760
with a stop on on computation formal

1210
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,440
computation despite being a

1211
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,359
mathematician by training

1212
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,160
um and

1213
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,960
and it was a little more familiar with

1214
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,359
with all the physics stuff but yeah

1215
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,400
I thought it was great

1216
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,000
thank you all right thank you I will uh

1217
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,800
close it so in about two weeks we'll

1218
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,900
have the first discussion everyone's

1219
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,960
welcome to join I will uh share with

1220
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,240
Hunter and Chris the questions and we

1221
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,099
can develop that and we'll have that on

1222
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:46,680
the course front end um before the

1223
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,780
coming discussion so thanks again

1224
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:52,160
fellows see you next time

1225
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:55,579
thank you
