3540	49264	00:03	This is session one of the course physics as Information Processing with Chris Fields. Check out the video description for a link to the course course overview website. You can ask questions that will be answered asynchronously register to participate in the discussions.	Session one of the course physics as Information Processing with Chris Fields	
49312	103380	00:49	Chris Fields will be presenting this course in six sessions. Aguirre Giray will be organizing discussion sessions after each of those. All of this is explained on the course website.	Chris Fields will be presenting this course in six sessions	Courses Introduction and Lecture
104730	581006	01:44	This is a course on physics as information processing. The most relevant history of this idea goes back to the mid 19th century. In consequence of that mid 20th century development, we're beginning to see a new idea about physics. What physics is really about is communication.	This is a course on physics as information processing	Quantum Information Processing
581188	1067446	09:41	In the mid 19th century, physicists were trying to figure out how to make better steam engines. Boltzman had the key insight that entropy is a measurement of our uncertainty about the state the system is in. This was really the beginning of modern physics.	Entropy is a measurement of uncertainty about the state a system is in	Quantum entropy from the 19th century
1067478	1363240	17:47	The Wick rotation was developed by Jean Carlo Wick in the 1950s. What the WIC rotation is really talking about is a rotation. In July, we'll come back to this and really probe what this Wick rotation means physically.	The Wick rotation in quantum theory wasn't understood until the 1950s	The Wick Rotation in quantum theory
1363610	1891680	22:43	Kurt Godel proved his famous first incompleteness theorem in 1929. The theorem states that no formal system that contains arithmetic can be both consistent and complete. It set the stage for thinking about an agent who interacts with a computational process.	No formal system that contains arithmetic can be both consistent and complete	Godel's Theorem and the incompleteness of mathematics
1892150	2517980	31:32	Feynman developed his path integral formulation of quantum theory. If you want to understand the output, you have to sum over all of the possible processes. Everything not explicitly forbidden is mandatory. The ultimate scattering experiment in physics is a black hole.	The ultimate scattering experiment in physics is a black hole	Quantum physics, Feynman and the totalitarian principle
2518350	3158550	41:58	 quantum information theory looks very different from the physics that came before. It's entirely changed the thinking about what physics is and what it's about. What the new physics wants to do is derive spacetime out of basically users experiences.	Quantum information theory looks very different from the physics that came before	Quantum information science: the Holographic Principle
3159560	3231540	52:39	In about two weeks, we'll have the first discussion. Everyone's welcome to join. I will share with Honor and Chris the questions, and we can develop that. Thanks again, fellows. See you next time.	Any closing thoughts? Or andrew, I'd love to hear your reflection	The History of Computation
