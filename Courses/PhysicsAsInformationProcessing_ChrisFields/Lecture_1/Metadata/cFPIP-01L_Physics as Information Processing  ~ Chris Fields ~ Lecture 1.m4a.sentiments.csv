60350	62200	C	0.8786039352416992	So I'll be the course assistant.
63180	70270	C	0.6398002505302429	I'm a postdoc in math, specializing in improbability, and I have a deep interest in the physics of information.
70640	74140	C	0.8561180233955383	And I've been familiar with Chris's papers for a while.
74290	76190	C	0.7776891589164734	So, yeah, just here to learn myself.
79460	80316	A	0.9060556888580322	Thank you, Andrew.
80348	81840	A	0.7970675826072693	And thank you, Daniel.
82260	99300	A	0.8753077387809753	I'm Chris Fields and I'll be presenting this course in six sessions and Aguirre will be organizing discussion sessions after each of those.
99670	103380	A	0.7847645282745361	And all of this is explained on the course website.
104730	108040	A	0.6439459323883057	So let's start.
109210	126810	A	0.8931147456169128	This is a course on physics as information processing, and this first session will be historical perspective on the idea that physics is or is about information processing.
127310	138478	A	0.806178092956543	And I'll just start with a few quotations that span the middle of the 20th century from Wittgenstein in 1920s saying the world is all that is the case.
138564	143490	A	0.7404960989952087	So defining the world in terms of facts, not objects.
144390	149410	A	0.8000609874725342	Landauer in the early 60s proclaiming that information is physical.
150470	162102	A	0.8470061421394348	And then John Archibald Wheeler, who in many ways is the grandfather of this era, recently stating it is it from Bit.
162236	167850	A	0.7868859767913818	So things come from information, I E bitstrings.
168910	177180	A	0.6019670963287354	And if nothing else, this shows that formulations of this idea get pithier as the 20th century rolls on.
178510	185390	A	0.77638840675354	But the history goes back farther clearly than the 20th century.
185730	196354	A	0.8840631246566772	But I'm only going to really talk about a piece of it and the timeline that I'll actually discuss today.
196472	203090	A	0.703178346157074	The most relevant history of this idea goes back to the mid 19th century.
204330	211750	A	0.8204901814460754	And the first specific thing I'll talk about is Clausia's definition of entropy.
212890	230750	A	0.8368523716926575	But with the beginning of the understanding of thermodynamics and the role of information in thermodynamics, you get this very interesting multidisciplinary progression of ideas that incorporates the beginning of quantum theory.
232850	252900	A	0.8195399045944214	And the beginning of quantum theory can kind of be dated to the first Solve conference in 1928 and the famous debate between Bohr and Einstein over whether quantum theory is about knowledge, information or objects things.
254650	261186	A	0.8305760622024536	But it incorporates a lot of work in computer science and logic and mathematics.
261298	275062	A	0.5657644271850586	So, interestingly, computer science was Born effectively in the mid 30s with the work of Church and Turing, which very rapidly converged with the work in physics.
275206	279530	A	0.7660602331161499	So today we'll be talking about both computer science and physics.
280850	286880	A	0.5366173386573792	And then in the second half of the 20th century, this just exploded into a huge area.
288050	303010	A	0.7288095355033875	And in consequence of that mid 20th century development, we're beginning to see a new idea about physics which is roughly encapsulated in quantum information theory.
303350	305494	A	0.8011128306388855	And the new idea is this.
305692	317686	A	0.8329198956489563	It's that what physics is actually about is information transfer across boundaries and the information we can represent.
317718	319978	A	0.7894407510757446	The information transfer like this.
320144	323260	A	0.6452305912971497	And this is a convention I'll use.
324030	326970	A	0.7557309865951538	A boundary is always a blue ellipse.
328030	339360	A	0.8120343685150146	And the agents that are exchanging information across this boundary are conventionally called Alice and Bob, which is just a more polite way of saying A and B.
340530	349890	A	0.6172544956207275	And when you think about this picture, it becomes clear that what physics is really about is communication.
350950	365750	A	0.595113217830658	And this is a wild redescription of the idea of what physics is compared to the ideas of Newton or LaPlace or even the 19th century ideas.
366170	393810	A	0.7621618509292603	And it's very different from the idea that's been preserved in 20th century physics in the lineage of Einstein and others who viewed classical physics as, in a sense, either as completely fundamental or as a fundamental adjunct to quantum theory.
394550	403090	A	0.8020117878913879	So this way of thinking about physics is a very deeply quantum theoretic way of thinking about physics.
403670	411702	A	0.8412759304046631	And where we're going in this course today is really how did this all happen?
411756	413400	A	0.8009225130081177	It's the origin story.
414650	435600	A	0.5774651169776917	And then in the next session, I want to discuss quantum information theory explicitly and in particular, how quantum theory makes this conclusion that physics is about communication very simple and obvious, much more obvious than it is in classical physics where it takes work to formulate this idea.
436610	451060	A	0.8469176888465881	Then in the next session, we're going to talk about semantics and how observations become meaningful to the agents who make them and hence how actions become meaningful to the agents who make them.
452230	465750	A	0.782052218914032	Then in August, we'll talk about communication theory a little bit more explicitly and talk about how agents employ multiple communication channels when they're communicating.
466410	475974	A	0.7554648518562317	And this is obvious when you think of people communicating, they not only talk to each other, they look at the same things, they point to things, et cetera.
476022	479950	A	0.8552939295768738	So this is what I mean by multiple communication channels.
480450	489210	A	0.8181869983673096	Then in September, we'll leverage that discussion to talk about how spacetime actually emerges from communication.
489290	493854	A	0.9113426208496094	And this is one of the most important aspects, I think, of quantum information theory.
493982	509960	A	0.7505125999450684	It provides us with a way of viewing spacetime as an emergent phenomenon, that communication is what is fundamental in some ontological sense, and the box in which it happens, spacetime is not.
511050	523530	A	0.7174749374389648	So the final session in October will talk about applications to biology via the free energy principle and future directions both in physics and biology and elsewhere.
524190	526294	A	0.9519366025924683	So it's going to be an interesting ride.
526422	541150	A	0.5024120211601257	I'm keeping formalism to a minimum because we're directing this toward the broad array of people who are interested in active inference and who are involved with the Active Inference Institute.
541830	553250	A	0.7679174542427063	And I would ask you to hold questions because we have a lot to get through in an hour for the interactive discussion and for the discussion forum.
554810	562470	A	0.6989081501960754	So I hope I explain things well enough that all of the concepts will be understandable.
563450	570780	A	0.8365519046783447	If not, Wikipedia is actually a wonderful resource in this area for just definitions of terms.
571230	577894	A	0.5315772294998169	So if there's anything that just a term that is a trip up, try Wikipedia.
577942	581006	A	0.8024783730506897	It's probably a very good source for what these terms mean.
581188	586990	A	0.8483315706253052	So let's start our story, as I said, begins in the 19th century.
587410	596130	A	0.6407638788223267	And in the mid 19th century, lots of physicists were devoting their efforts to figuring out how to make better steam engines.
596870	611282	A	0.7219200134277344	And one question that arises when you're trying to design a steam engine is what happens physically when you add heat to a system at constant temperature?
611346	615350	A	0.7696981430053711	So if you're building a steam engine, you've got a boiler, because you need to make steam.
615690	622330	A	0.702315628528595	And as you turn up the heat to your boiler, you get more steam, but the temperature doesn't change.
622480	624250	A	0.7245930433273315	So this is a mystery.
625470	634670	A	0.5594163537025452	What is the heat actually adding to the boiler that is not increasing the temperature?
635810	644530	A	0.8647416234016418	And Clausius responded to this question in a way that's sort of typical for a physicist or a mathematician.
645430	652478	A	0.650285542011261	Since he didn't know what the answer was, he just invented a new name for whatever it was and gave it a formal definition.
652654	665270	A	0.5944665670394897	So he called it entropy, which is a made up word that, if it was translated from the Greek, would roughly mean transformation content in trophy.
666250	683360	A	0.8535195589065552	And he represented it by a simple equation that the change in this new concept entropy, which is always called S, is just equal to the change in heat Q at constant temperature t.
683730	700210	A	0.7888267636299133	So obviously, this equation just reformulates the question in declarative form, saying whatever this stuff is, its changes in this stuff are just changes in heat at constant temperature.
700790	702580	A	0.806324303150177	Well, heat is energy.
702950	716066	A	0.7872084975242615	And this wasn't completely recognized in the mid 19th century, but the way you'll see this equation in a current textbook is DS is the change in energy at constant temperature.
716258	724010	A	0.7934138178825378	So even more commonly, you would see it written as the change in energy is equal to the temperature times the change in entropy.
724430	728950	A	0.7497333288192749	It's the most common sort of textbook way of seeing this.
729120	732010	A	0.7966153621673584	But the question, of course, is, what is this quantity?
732090	733498	A	0.5120000243186951	What is this entropy?
733594	735440	A	0.8094905614852905	What does this concept mean?
736450	753300	A	0.8121014833450317	And about 15 years after Klausius proposed it, Boltzman had the key insight, which is that entropy is a measurement of our uncertainty about the state the system is in.
754490	773820	A	0.8380789756774902	And in particular, he again, of course, went to formalism and said, the entropy S is equal to some constant times the number of states that the system can be in that look the same to us.
774750	782542	A	0.7956568002700806	And since that number of states is enormous, the way to make that manageable is to take the log of the number of states.
782676	785310	A	0.8268786072731018	The natural log is ln.
786050	790270	A	0.5425401926040649	And this constant k is called Baltimore's constant.
791750	811080	A	0.6168462634086609	And Baltimore was able to do this because he subscribed to a radical, very unpopular theory that material things, including gases like air, were made of atoms and heat made the atoms move around.
811770	816646	A	0.8480329513549805	And as you increase the amount of heat, the atoms can move in many different ways.
816828	822010	A	0.795600414276123	So the number of states that they can be in that look the same to us increases.
822350	823914	A	0.6866942048072815	And that's what entropy is.
823952	832622	A	0.7562966346740723	It's this increase in the number of states that the system can be in that all look the same to us with the measurements that we can make.
832676	837840	A	0.5922298431396484	And since they look the same to us, we're uncertain about exactly what state they're in.
839250	841870	A	0.6593271493911743	So entropy is a measure of uncertainty.
843190	846370	A	0.6597529053688049	This was really the beginning of modern physics.
847510	855014	A	0.8241601586341858	Because what it says now is that decreasing uncertainty requires energy.
855212	859480	A	0.8485405445098877	It links a measurement of uncertainty to a measurement of energy.
860490	871580	A	0.4963458478450775	And if you think about the uncertainty principle in quantum theory, the core idea of the uncertainty principle is you can't measure a system without disturbing it.
872270	877914	A	0.7025517821311951	So to actually act on a system requires energy.
878032	880400	A	0.7505016326904297	And that's what you have to do to get information.
881330	885710	A	0.797834575176239	So here's Boltzman, basically, inventing quantum theory.
887490	892000	A	0.7443044781684875	So we're going to fast forward by another 15 years, to 1900.
892850	903540	A	0.6867339611053467	And in 1900, Planck solved this problem called the black body radiation problem, which was basically how much heat does your hot boiler give off into the air?
904490	918766	A	0.5929252505302429	And all of the measurements of the heat that hot boilers gave off to the air ran into problems in classical physics and caused contradictions and quantities that went to infinity.
918818	920346	A	0.9042094349861145	And all of that was bad.
920528	927078	A	0.5370727777481079	So many people were trying to solve this problem, and Planck solved it by making a simple postulate.
927174	932570	A	0.8982399106025696	He said the energy of the radiation is proportional to its frequency.
932650	935440	A	0.8162930011749268	So its color in the case of light.
935970	942154	A	0.8166714906692505	And if you go higher frequency, you end up in ultraviolet and X rays and gamma rays.
942202	946740	A	0.8231683373451233	If you go to lower frequency, you go into microwaves and radio and all of that.
947670	951182	A	0.8912549018859863	So this is a nice way of talking about radiation.
951326	953330	A	0.712587833404541	And it turned out that this solved the problem.
953400	963590	A	0.8605295419692993	I mean, just assuming this simple proportionality relationship produced spectra for black body radiation that worked, that matched what you saw experimentally.
964250	965958	A	0.8863269686698914	Well, this means something very important.
966044	972906	A	0.8714978098869324	It means because this number h, the proportionality constant called plaque's constant, is a number.
973008	974198	A	0.6809727549552917	It's Finite.
974374	977930	A	0.8723052740097046	It means that energy comes in discrete units of H.
978080	984080	A	0.616108775138855	You can have one H or two H or 10 million H, but you can't have half an H of energy.
985890	987290	A	0.7771539688110352	So it's quantized.
987450	991230	A	0.682135283946991	And this is widely recognized as the birth of quantum theory.
991750	994580	A	0.6201999187469482	But of course, we should have known this already.
994950	997060	A	0.7585461139678955	If we just thought a little bit.
997430	997890	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
997960	1007110	A	0.8646156191825867	We Know that changes of energy are proportional to changes in entropy by temperature.
1007610	1016120	A	0.6669481992721558	And we know that entropy is a measure of the number of states, and numbers of states are just numbers.
1016750	1028140	A	0.6237766146659851	You can have one state, two states, three states, 10 million states, 100 billion states, but they're all just a number, one up.
1029310	1030486	A	0.6622770428657532	And it's not infinite.
1030518	1035360	A	0.5758940577507019	There's not an infinite number of states unless you have an infinite amount of energy, which you don't have.
1036050	1040910	A	0.6584665179252625	So we knew already that entropy could only take discrete values.
1041330	1048530	A	0.6876701712608337	And since energy and entropy are basically the same thing, we knew already that energy could only take discrete values.
1049110	1057030	A	0.8386831879615784	So we could have realized in 1900 that energy is quantized because the number of states is quantized.
1058410	1067446	A	0.6398059129714966	So it shouldn't have really been a mystery why energy was quantized, but it was a mystery, and it stayed a mystery, and it said, still a mystery.
1067478	1091870	A	0.7339985370635986	People still debate the meaning of quantum theory, but another thing we could have known in 1900 was something very important, and it's that this quantum of action, planck's constant, which has units of action, which is energy times time, is intimately related to Boltzman's constant.
1093510	1099970	A	0.8778009414672852	And Boltzman's constant has units of energy over temperature.
1101910	1106020	A	0.533923327922821	But this wasn't actually understood until the 1950s.
1106870	1109158	A	0.6574087142944336	No one really figured that this out.
1109244	1112214	A	0.8306406140327454	There was this relation until the 1950s.
1112412	1117290	A	0.8213745355606079	And when it was figured out, it was figured out by a guy named Jean Carlo Wick.
1117710	1129930	A	0.8429504632949829	And he introduced this notion of the Wick rotation by realizing that if you have an equation in classical physics, and in it, there's the term one over KT.
1130910	1135658	A	0.7779357433319092	You can always replace that one over KT with this other expression.
1135754	1137150	A	0.6711328625679016	It over h bar.
1137220	1143250	A	0.5130470991134644	H bar is just h divided by two pi, and you'll get an equation that's valid in quantum theory.
1143910	1147730	A	0.5651777982711792	And this is typically described in textbooks as a trick.
1148310	1154760	A	0.6584546566009521	And whenever something in physics is described as a trick, what that really means is it's something we don't understand.
1156650	1161030	A	0.8186794519424438	And lots of papers have been written about the meaning of the WIC rotation.
1162890	1169980	A	0.8718491196632385	But to start to understand the WIC rotation, I want to look at this equation a little bit.
1171790	1183134	A	0.6498969793319702	One over KT is one over in energy, and it over h bar is one over in energy.
1183252	1197250	A	0.8393235802650452	Since h bar is units of energy times time, we have time in this equation, and then we have this factor, I, which is typically thought of as just an imaginary number.
1197400	1199940	A	0.8252347111701965	So it's the square root of minus one.
1200550	1203358	A	0.7561764121055603	And what's this I doing in this equation?
1203454	1206454	A	0.8015528321266174	And in fact, you see factors of it over h bar.
1206492	1211698	A	0.8231860995292664	If you're familiar with quantum theory everywhere in quantum theory.
1211874	1216040	A	0.7836246490478516	So what's the meaning of this imaginary number?
1217230	1234670	A	0.618865430355072	And if you just think of it or of I as this arbitrary imaginary number that somehow renders the equation mysterious, then the whole of quantum theory is mysterious, but the Wick rotation is very mysterious.
1235250	1238990	A	0.7965693473815918	But what I is actually is an operator.
1239970	1246910	A	0.8558245897293091	And if you think of the real numbers as an axis, which is always drawn horizontally.
1246990	1248082	A	0.6470105051994324	So here it is.
1248216	1252482	A	0.7254575490951538	Here's zero, and the axis is pointing that way.
1252536	1256326	A	0.6887447237968445	I'm sorry, I can't get the camera really far enough away to see my arm here.
1256508	1258070	A	0.8148293495178223	So what is I?
1258220	1265190	A	0.8755742311477661	I is actually an operator that rotates the whole real axis by 90 degrees.
1265690	1272954	A	0.8404268622398376	So if you see a plot of complex numbers, then the real numbers go this way, and the, quote, imaginary numbers go that way.
1272992	1277638	A	0.8963041305541992	So what multiplying by I has done is rotate by 90 degrees.
1277814	1286400	A	0.4827163517475128	And of course, if you do I squared, you rotate twice by 90 degrees by arm would do this, but you end up pointing that way, and those are the negative numbers.
1286930	1297358	A	0.8946017622947693	So I is an operator that rotates something by 90 degrees, and if you rotate four times by 90 degrees, you're back to the identity.
1297534	1299780	A	0.8062598705291748	So I to the fourth is one.
1300950	1308950	A	0.8634915351867676	So this tells us something very interesting, which is that what the WIC rotation is really talking about is a rotation.
1309770	1312230	A	0.7831136584281921	It's a geometrical equation.
1313290	1322410	A	0.911548376083374	And in July, we'll come back to this and really probe what this Wick rotation means physically.
1324990	1332640	A	0.5266198515892029	But as I said, this wasn't understood to the 1950s, and by the 1950s, a lot had happened.
1333010	1334954	A	0.8441784381866455	So quantum theory had been developed.
1335002	1336922	A	0.7980709671974182	Bohren Einstein had had their debate.
1336986	1338814	A	0.841683566570282	Particle accelerators had been built.
1338852	1340574	A	0.6232837438583374	The atomic bomb had been built.
1340692	1349794	A	0.6817382574081421	Nuclear physics was well in its way, so an enormous amount of practical physics had been done.
1349912	1351966	A	0.5930046439170837	Quantum theory was highly developed.
1351998	1360310	A	0.8207352757453918	People were starting to think about quantum field theory before they made this simple realization that's formulated in the Wick rotation.
1360650	1363240	A	0.7198269367218018	So this is a harboring of things to come.
1363610	1372060	A	0.8501865863800049	But before we continue in physics, we need to backtrack in time a little bit and look at what the mathematicians were doing.
1373150	1385146	A	0.6478248834609985	So across the hall in the math department, one year after the Solve conference in 1929, kurt Godel proved his famous first incompleteness theorem.
1385338	1391280	A	0.7574840188026428	And the theorem states that no formal system that contains arithmetic can be both consistent and complete.
1392630	1405880	A	0.5526741743087769	And that means that either there are true statements that aren't provable in the formal system, or there are false statements that are provable, or, of course, both.
1406810	1411878	A	0.5473259687423706	And Godel's proof is actually extremely simple.
1411964	1428010	A	0.5497810244560242	Almost all of the work in the proof is setting up all of the notation and procedures and so forth to formulate within arithmetic the sentence, this sentence is not provable.
1429090	1436800	A	0.8191507458686829	And once you have that sentence formulated within arithmetic, then the conclusion of the proof is obvious.
1437250	1443890	A	0.8031787872314453	If you can prove the sentence, this sentence is not provable, then you've proved something that's false.
1444230	1450686	A	0.5786234736442566	And if you can't prove it, then there are sentences that you can't prove in arithmetic.
1450878	1473686	A	0.7826665639877319	So this was incredibly bad news for mathematicians who thought that finite discrete operations, which is what proofs are and also what computations are, can exhaustively enumerate the facts and this was the assumption behind Wittgenstein's claim that the world is all that is the case, the world is a collection of facts.
1473878	1483600	A	0.5891150236129761	And optimistically, he thought that first order logic would allow us to enumerate all those facts and we'd be done dreams of a final theory again.
1485970	1496690	A	0.725957453250885	So Godel's Theorem means that no system with finite capabilities, no system that can just do finite discrete operations, can fully describe its environment.
1497110	1503810	A	0.6757861375808716	It will always be in an environment where there are true things that aren't provable or false things that are provable.
1504890	1512040	A	0.7485589981079102	But I think more relative to a discussion of agents is that it means that no agent can describe itself.
1512970	1528540	A	0.5587725639343262	Any agent's theory of itself will either contain true statements that it can't derive or false statements, or it will either miss true statements that it can't derive or wind up deriving things that are false about itself.
1529410	1532320	A	0.666910707950592	Of course, we see this in psychology all the time.
1533410	1544190	A	0.8736901879310608	So an immediate consequence of Godel's Theorem was an intense investigation of what computation actually is, what it meant to talk about finite discrete operations.
1544850	1548782	A	0.800751805305481	And two leaders of this were, of course, Church and Turing.
1548846	1560440	A	0.8427824378013611	And here's a picture of a Turing machine, which is just a little device with a couple of tapes and a tape reader and a simple logic unit that either writes a one or a zero if it sees a one or a zero.
1561450	1577530	A	0.86203932762146	And they defined a computation as a process that can be implemented in finite time by such a machine or by Church's lambda calculus or by any of the now hundreds of other methods that are provably equivalent to a Turing machine.
1578030	1579820	A	0.8071813583374023	So what does this mean?
1580270	1589200	A	0.748859167098999	It means that computation is a physical process that can be mechanized and it turns out, mechanized in any one of a huge array of ways.
1590050	1594846	A	0.5899171829223633	It means that many different implementations of any computation are possible.
1594948	1600530	A	0.5465657114982605	So I can do it on a Turing machine, I can do it on my laptop, I can do it on my head, et cetera.
1601270	1605554	A	0.5621526837348938	The most important things it means is that there are questions with no computable answer.
1605672	1608306	A	0.5579378604888916	This is the Revenge of Godel's theorem.
1608498	1613798	A	0.6399199366569519	And two of the most famous questions of this kind are given some arbitrary program.
1613884	1614882	A	0.8363693356513977	Will it halt?
1615026	1617578	A	0.8776912689208984	Will it get to an answer in finite time?
1617744	1622410	A	0.5360767245292664	And the answer to that question is this is undecidable.
1622750	1625260	A	0.7275906801223755	No procedure can figure this out.
1626270	1634670	A	0.5970010757446289	And the other undecidable question is, given some arbitrary program, what function does it compute?
1635090	1640730	A	0.6564169526100159	And you'd think that would be simple, that you can read a program and figure out what function it computes.
1640890	1643502	A	0.6202101707458496	But it turns out that is undecidable.
1643646	1647620	A	0.6686886548995972	That cannot be done by any finite process.
1649270	1659990	A	0.8090648651123047	So this was another body blow to the goal of understanding everything with finite discrete processes.
1660330	1663366	A	0.5346744060516357	But it also set the stage for something new.
1663548	1676380	A	0.8902686238288879	It set the stage for thinking about an agent who interacts with a computational process by giving it an input and then looking at its output sometime later.
1678110	1686590	A	0.6959896087646484	And this, of course, will look familiar because I've included the blue ellipse, which is the boundary, which these days we call a user interface.
1687490	1697700	A	0.8381358981132507	And the user interface just allows some finite action on the system and then the ability to observe some finite response by the system.
1698150	1707574	A	0.913280189037323	So we can now ask what can Alice determine by acting in some finite way and then making some finite number of observations I.
1707612	1708200	A	0.547865092754364	E.
1708650	1713880	A	0.8432119488716125	Receiving some finite number of outputs from the system that she's acting on.
1715850	1722326	A	0.7983077168464661	And the first 20 years of this produced a large number of answers, all of them negative.
1722518	1731070	A	0.6717901825904846	So to go back to Turing, he proved that Alice can't tell what's implementing the function that she sees being implemented.
1731970	1737002	A	0.5561221241950989	She can't tell whether a given input will lead to an output.
1737066	1738560	A	0.7515236139297485	That's the halting problem.
1740130	1745380	A	0.5434266924858093	Shannon showed that Alice can't tell what the inputs mean to the system.
1746390	1751330	A	0.7604223489761353	His whole theory of communication is completely independent of semantics.
1751910	1758470	A	0.6340548992156982	And his theory of communication actually accurately describes what Alice can observe.
1759930	1769130	A	0.7148358821868896	Rice is the one who proved that you can't determine what program is generating the outputs.
1769950	1780510	A	0.7357439398765564	And then Moore proved a very similar result in a completely different formal setting of general cybernetics that you can't tell what process is generating the outputs by finite observation.
1781570	1793950	A	0.879554808139801	But what Alice can do is build a predictive model of what generates the output she sees in response to her inputs and test it by designing new inputs.
1794370	1800930	A	0.774196207523346	And this is, of course, as Karl Popper told us, the process that we call science.
1801430	1807080	A	0.7127929329872131	So Alice can do science even though she can't answer any of these fundamental questions.
1810010	1824730	A	0.7379775047302246	Now, this, of course, has a huge technological consequence since this theory of computation tells us that processes are effectively virtual.
1826430	1831306	A	0.577077329158783	We don't know what they are and we can't determine what they are except in theory.
1831418	1841600	A	0.6608936190605164	By making a theory technologically, it means we're free to use virtualization everywhere because we have to deal with it anyway.
1842470	1845758	A	0.729656994342804	And this allows us to build multilevel architectures.
1845854	1855960	A	0.6613593101501465	It means that we can architect computers where no layer of the computation has any idea what's going on below or above it and doesn't need to.
1857290	1860520	A	0.8031346201896667	And that's what makes practical programming possible.
1861130	1878780	A	0.5340719819068909	So from these no go theorems that tell you what you can't do, you actually get an enormous boost into it and use to probe the world and develop theories and on and on and on.
1880290	1891680	A	0.6025004982948303	So in a sense, Godel birthed not only computer science, but practical computing by showing us that virtualization is just the way the world works.
1892150	1908230	A	0.7572240829467773	So now let's go back to physics where these ideas were replicated, basically reintroduced, reinvented by Feynman in developing his path integral formulation of quantum theory.
1908570	1921882	A	0.8768571019172668	And basically what Feyman realized was that in any physical process, the observer Alice prepares some state that she's interested in.
1921936	1924730	A	0.8984673023223877	She prepares some input to an experiment.
1925230	1932080	A	0.819999635219574	Then she lets something happen, and then she sees what the result of the experiment is.
1932450	1936110	A	0.8415803909301758	And the canonical experiment in physics is scattering.
1936450	1944420	A	0.7888422608375549	You fire two protons at each other, and they intersect someplace, and stuff comes out, and you measure the stuff that comes out.
1944950	1952580	A	0.8974477052688599	And what you can measure is momentum and spin energy, things like that position.
1953510	1961762	A	0.8621249794960022	So these processes conserve the total values of the things you can measure.
1961826	1974940	A	0.7758677005767822	So in particular, they preserve momentum and angular momentum, and they preserve other things that are harder to measure and are only approximately conserved anyway, like Lepton number.
1975710	1996020	A	0.7765704393386841	But Feynman's contribution to this way of thinking about experiments was to say, look, if you want to understand the output, you have to sum over all of the possible processes that could have produced the output from the input, no matter how improbable they are.
1996790	2016370	A	0.8442351222038269	So the famous idea from Feynman diagrams is if you have an electron that's scattering off an atom, you measure the initial state of the electron that you've generated with an accelerator or something, and you measure the final state, which involves momentum and spin and so forth.
2016530	2035120	A	0.5865539312362671	And for all you knew, partway through the process, the electron disappeared, and an entire universe appeared and then annihilated with a copy of an entire anti universe, and the electron came back out.
2035730	2043570	A	0.7953752279281616	And you have to include processes like that if you really want to understand and correctly predict the outcomes of your measurements.
2044230	2056274	A	0.8455477356910706	And Murray Gelman lifted the bumper sticker slogan from Th White and the once and Future King everything not explicitly forbidden is mandatory.
2056322	2058520	A	0.8161745071411133	That sums up Feynman's idea.
2060090	2072490	A	0.5730584859848022	And this is called the totalitarian principle, since it's what's written in Th White's book on the kingdom of the ants, for which everything not explicitly forbidden is mandatory.
2073550	2080026	A	0.8297946453094482	So let's think about a real example that's a bit actually, it's the same as scattering.
2080058	2085470	A	0.6787703633308411	The ultimate scattering experiment in physics is a black hole.
2086610	2091840	A	0.7527194619178772	Stuff goes into the horizon, stars, whole galaxies, whatever.
2092710	2096322	A	0.7004018425941467	Something happens, and stuff comes out.
2096376	2110840	A	0.7732128500938416	And what comes out is Hawking radiation, and information is conserved if the information in the Hawking radiation is actually the same as the information in the stuff that went in.
2111770	2115650	A	0.530486524105072	And conservation is not qualitative.
2115730	2116910	A	0.6183760166168213	It's quantitative.
2117010	2121130	A	0.7639971971511841	It's only the quantity of information that's supposed to be preserved.
2121790	2130270	A	0.7960707545280457	And you can ask, how much is the information that's being emitted by a black hole that's emitting Hawking radiation?
2130930	2137658	A	0.5831952095031738	And Beckenstein was the one who figured this out, using an incredibly simple argument.
2137834	2140160	A	0.8165989518165588	But I'll just give the answer here.
2140530	2162920	A	0.7145213484764099	The answer is that the total entropy of the black hole is its area divided by four, and the area in this equation has to be computed in Planck units, which are units where Planck's constant and the speed of light and boltzman's constant and other interesting things are all set equal to one.
2164170	2172810	A	0.8688255548477173	So one Planck area is the Planck length squared, which turns out to be about ten to the minus squared.
2173470	2178460	A	0.7315165400505066	So this is that black holes are the most entropic entities we know of.
2178930	2199730	A	0.6463241577148438	So a black hole about this big with a radius of about a meter has an entropy of about ten to the 70th, which is, of course, an astonishingly big number, and a black hole with the area of the sun.
2199880	2212440	A	0.855419933795929	So a moderate sized cosmological black hole, a real thing that we can observe with a gravity wave telescope or something, has an entropy of about ten to the 79th.
2212810	2224300	A	0.7203495502471924	And really big black holes, which are bigger than the entire solar system, have entropies into the ten to the something.
2225070	2228650	A	0.7887710928916931	So these are enormously entropic entities.
2230930	2233998	A	0.6688711643218994	But Beckenstein didn't just tell us that.
2234084	2240830	A	0.8882827162742615	He told us something about the structure of the interface, the horizon of a black hole.
2241510	2243700	A	0.6333501935005188	And this is what he told us.
2246790	2256950	A	0.7631208896636963	You can compute entropy in bits just by using logs, base two instead of logs based e, natural logs.
2257370	2263560	A	0.8268569111824036	And that's just multiplying the natural log by about 1.4.
2264810	2272620	A	0.8305307626724243	So we can write the entropy of black hole, of black hole in units of bits, and it's about a over six.
2273630	2280270	A	0.7543222904205322	So what does this mean to say that we can think of the entropy in terms of bits?
2280610	2308690	A	0.8692829012870789	What it says is that we can think of the interface in terms of a bit array, and we can think of all of these bits as encoded on this interface at a density of one bit every roughly six plank lengths squared, six plank areas.
2308850	2312470	A	0.8108908534049988	So this is an incredibly dense encoding in a black hole.
2314650	2317014	A	0.8135588765144348	And it's an interesting idea about black holes.
2317062	2321498	A	0.6214924454689026	But what gets really interesting is what happens when you generalize it.
2321584	2327260	A	0.6235566735267639	And of course, physicists are prone to generalization, and that's what happened next.
2330110	2337150	A	0.915552020072937	Gerard to Hooft, almost immediately thereafter, on the basis of Beckenstein's work, formulated the Holographic principle.
2337730	2346050	A	0.7871668338775635	And what the Holographic principle says is we can think of any system as approximately a black hole.
2346870	2350210	A	0.8012672662734985	And the only approximation is the encoding density.
2350950	2361042	A	0.8068521618843079	The boundary of any system encodes the information that we can get about the system at some density.
2361106	2366150	A	0.6277325749397278	And the density is less than the density for a black hole because we're not black holes.
2367370	2379130	A	0.6428126096725464	And this rules out a lot by limiting the amount of information that you can extract from a system to the amount of information that you can actually write on its boundary.
2379790	2385406	A	0.5948664546012878	And one of the things that it rules out is knowing the geometry on the inside of the system.
2385588	2402034	A	0.48813825845718384	And to Hoof put it this way, which I think is a brilliant thought experiment, he says, look, the metric inside this system can be so curved, effectively the space time inside the system can be so curved that you could stick an entire universe inside.
2402232	2409750	A	0.6224157810211182	And we never know because it wouldn't change the amount of entropy number of bits that are encoded on the boundary.
2410650	2413494	A	0.8001919984817505	So the inside geometry can be anything.
2413692	2415414	A	0.5603297352790833	And you can't find out by.
2415452	2417740	A	0.8087019324302673	Looking at the outside of the system.
2418990	2424010	A	0.8102152347564697	Now, the Holographic principle almost follows from classical physics.
2425630	2440670	A	0.8886647820472717	There's Euler's theorem, which tells you about one over R squared forces, and you can think of the force as penetrating the boundary at some density.
2441250	2451330	A	0.8215991854667664	And the difference between Euler's theorem and the Holographic principle is just that the density in classical physics can go to infinity.
2451990	2460466	A	0.8258179426193237	And in the Holographic principle, it can only go to this maximal density that's achieved by a black hole.
2460658	2461110	A	0.6120101809501648	Why?
2461180	2469100	A	0.7470494508743286	Because if you try to get any higher, more information, the information gets sucked into the black hole, and you can't get it out.
2471390	2484560	A	0.8782303929328918	So the Holographic principle becomes a guiding principle for thinking about any physical system and what it means to extract information from a physical system.
2485330	2488974	A	0.7264813184738159	And in fact, we'll talk about this next time.
2489172	2495060	A	0.7904147505760193	You can say exactly what the information encoded on the boundary of any system is.
2496790	2513106	A	0.8355867266654968	And what I'll go through next time is seeing that the information that's encoded on the boundary is a specification of the energy that's being exchanged by the interaction, which, of course, is linear in the number of bits.
2513138	2515830	A	0.70976722240448	It's just counting the number of bits.
2517230	2517980	A	0.7123860716819763	Okay?
2518350	2539630	A	0.7374876737594604	So with the Holographic principle, we now have a complete new science about systems that are exchanging finite discrete information across a boundary by encoding that information on the boundary and then reading the information off the boundary.
2540370	2545650	A	0.6716278195381165	So here's a new way of thinking about physical interaction.
2545990	2558658	A	0.9175509810447693	Alice writes a message on her boundary with Bob, and Bob reads the message off the boundary and then writes his own new message, which Alice then reads.
2558834	2562280	A	0.6302379965782166	And of course, that's what's happening right now.
2562970	2570886	A	0.7814405560493469	I'm writing information by speaking on an interface, which is effectively the Internet.
2571078	2576250	A	0.5746753215789795	And you're reading that information off the Internet by listening to it.
2576400	2584030	A	0.7942094206809998	And when we get time for questions, you'll be writing information on the Internet, which I'll be reading.
2585250	2589658	A	0.5203272700309753	Now, the key thing about this new science is that it's topological.
2589754	2596942	A	0.7850307822227478	It's about connectivity across some communication channel, which we represent as a boundary.
2597086	2602930	A	0.8056694865226746	It's not geometric, so it doesn't assume anything about spacetime.
2604090	2613030	A	0.5603653192520142	So it allows us to build a model of space in particular as an emergent phenomenon.
2613370	2627100	A	0.7311910390853882	And it allows us to see time as not some absolute external abstraction, but something that the communicating agents measure for themselves.
2628430	2631920	A	0.7925876379013062	And so they each act in their own time.
2633090	2640906	A	0.8442115187644958	And we get a very natural measure of time in terms of how many bits I see coming across my boundary.
2640938	2651250	A	0.7159745693206787	And again, we'll talk about that in the next couple of sessions and then talk about it more thoroughly in September when we talk about emergent spacetime.
2652230	2664882	A	0.5777502655982971	So quantum information theory looks very different from the physics that came before, not because it's adopted a new formalism, the tools of quantum theory.
2665026	2681840	A	0.757919430732727	It's because it's entirely changed the thinking about what physics is and what it's about and replace this idea of forces and balls banging into each other and all of that with the idea of communication between agents.
2682530	2687310	A	0.7341761589050293	And of course that's familiar from an active inference perspective.
2687890	2695710	A	0.9087377190589905	So we can now back up a little bit to see what they were doing in classical physics during this period.
2695790	2697682	A	0.8223137259483337	Well, let me go on a little bit.
2697736	2698340	A	0.5092127919197083	Sorry.
2702070	2714226	A	0.7028090357780457	This is just a slide quoting Wheeler, who of course is the most radical in terms of impitheist, in terms of formulating these ideas.
2714418	2718250	A	0.8813089728355408	But here's his characterization of this new physics.
2718830	2720490	A	0.6889902353286743	It's not reductive.
2721630	2723930	A	0.7543360590934753	All of the reasoning is circular.
2725230	2731630	A	0.6597810387611389	You don't have smaller things and then yet smaller things, and then yet smaller things forever.
2733090	2734510	A	0.5478295087814331	There are no laws.
2736690	2741070	A	0.7703453302383423	So what you see on the interface is a message.
2741220	2747090	A	0.5810103416442871	It's not something that's governed by laws since the beginning of the universe.
2747830	2749406	A	0.5559830665588379	There's no continuum.
2749518	2752050	A	0.5580920577049255	So there's nothing described by real numbers.
2752120	2753930	A	0.743823766708374	It's all described by integers.
2754030	2756710	A	0.8081706762313843	Everything's done in finite dimensional spaces.
2757050	2762280	A	0.6517679691314697	And finally, and most importantly, there's no spacetime box in which things happen.
2762810	2766294	A	0.6678608059883118	So think of how radical this is means.
2766332	2773290	A	0.5398708581924438	There's no big bang, there's no big rip, there's no bouncing universe.
2773870	2779290	A	0.6275800466537476	All of those ideas are out the window because they're classical and they're about spacetime.
2779970	2787390	A	0.8577554225921631	And what the new physics wants to do is derive spacetime out of basically users experiences.
2788850	2796142	A	0.8247649073600769	So the agents here are all observer participants in Wheeler's language.
2796206	2804450	A	0.8076395392417908	But what that just means is agents that want to communicate and it's their communication that gives rise to physics.
2805850	2818810	A	0.8342029452323914	So now we'll go back to classical physics and what was happening, or one thing that was happening in classical physics at that time was a lot of thinking about stochastic causal networks.
2819630	2835130	A	0.8514935374259949	And Pearl realized that if you have any stochastic causal network that's unidirectional, then around any node, you can draw what he called a Markov blanket.
2835290	2857080	A	0.8686916828155518	And a Markov blanket is just the set of nodes in the network that absorb all outside causation and then transmit that causation into whatever node you're interested in and then absorb all causation coming from the node you're interested in and transmit it to the rest of the world.
2857770	2864642	A	0.5900617837905884	And so we can redraw that in Part B here, and it should look very familiar.
2864706	2869900	A	0.7986600995063782	A Markov blanket is just a classical physics way of talking about a Holographic screen.
2870670	2884874	A	0.8653306365013123	And the number of nodes in the Markov blanket, or in particular the number of degrees of freedom times the number of nodes, is just the number of bits that flow across that Markov blanket.
2884922	2889520	A	0.7270457744598389	So it's the entropy of the effective Holographic screen.
2892390	2898210	A	0.8734675645828247	All these ideas were reinvented more or less independently within classical physics.
2898950	2921960	A	0.7697163820266724	And it was from this classical physics background that Karl Freston came up with the idea that a Markov blanket defines a persistence, at least from an active inference institute point of view everyone is familiar with, because it's the foundation of the idea of active inference.
2924620	2936140	A	0.8244904279708862	Any system that persists through time does so by making sure that it doesn't dissolve into its environment.
2936560	2938284	A	0.7467814087867737	Well, what does that mean?
2938482	2947040	A	0.8740540742874146	It means it persists through time by maintaining the integrity of its Markov blanket or the integrity of its boundary.
2947620	2967380	A	0.9002165794372559	So this of course is just a tautology, but it's a very interesting and very productive tautology because it says that any system is using the information it gets on its boundary from its environment to build a model of how its environment behaves.
2967960	2975690	A	0.8882673978805542	And then it uses that model to act back on its environment to test and refine its model.
2976380	2980490	A	0.5205275416374207	And again, as Popper told us, this is just what science is.
2981120	2989470	A	0.802592933177948	So what the free energy principle really tells us is that all systems are agents that are doing science all the time.
2990400	3011060	A	0.8191672563552856	So physics is effectively not just the study of communication, but it's the study of agents doing science with each other, pairs of agents who are trying to figure each other out by their communicative exchanges.
3012200	3043020	A	0.726575493812561	So that's the history of how we got from 1930s sorry, 1850s thermodynamics to the free energy principle and how the free energy principle connects to these very deep and extremely radical, especially within context ideas in quantum theory and quantum cosmology and computer science.
3043540	3079560	A	0.6302264928817749	All of which tell us that the world we see is a projection that's being written on our boundaries by a process that we have no access to except the procedure of active inference or the procedure of science, which is to formulate predictive models and test them by doing things in the world and seeing how the world responds.
3081360	3085260	A	0.7286084890365601	So that's it for this session.
3087200	3097250	A	0.9394470453262329	The first discussion session which Andrew is going to lead will be the 3 June at this same time, I E 05:00 European time.
3098180	3102960	A	0.8786694407463074	And then my session number two will be in mid June.
3103700	3111910	A	0.8432449102401733	And if you look at the course website, there's this subsidiary website for interactive Q and A.
3112360	3132060	A	0.9130823612213135	And I invite everyone to post questions and discuss them and hope that we'll have an interesting exchange and that everyone will come to sort of an understanding of what was talked about today through discussion.
3132560	3140888	A	0.5547906160354614	And we'll be interested in being back in June to see how to formulate this in quantum theory.
3140984	3151424	A	0.9759365320205688	So thank you very much and thank you again, Daniel, for organizing this and hosting it and putting together all the technical things necessary to pull this off.
3151622	3153570	A	0.8095364570617676	I could never do that on my own.
3155140	3155744	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3155782	3158550	B	0.9835593104362488	We're really excited here.
3159560	3160816	B	0.8222025036811829	Any closing thoughts?
3160848	3165140	B	0.7173362970352173	Or andrew, I'd love to hear your reflection just briefly.
3166120	3172570	B	0.9019050598144531	How would you have told that history or how does that history reflect on the areas that you're familiar with?
3174380	3176890	C	0.5496953725814819	Well, I don't think I have much to add.
3178860	3183176	C	0.534125566482544	I've been mainly interested in the weak rotation part.
3183278	3187020	C	0.9844600558280945	I'm excited to hear more about that, Chris.
3188240	3192620	C	0.7985879778862	But no, I found this to be a very nice summary.
3193040	3208710	C	0.8886075615882874	I'm less familiar with the staff on computation, formal computation, despite being a mathematician by training, it was a little more familiar with all the physics stuff, but yeah, I thought it was great.
3209400	3210436	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3210618	3211508	A	0.4896698594093323	All right.
3211674	3212244	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3212282	3213396	B	0.6678029298782349	I will close it.
3213418	3216320	B	0.8883487582206726	So in about two weeks, we'll have the first discussion.
3216400	3218272	B	0.9469261765480042	Everyone's welcome to join.
3218416	3222996	B	0.7155255079269409	I will share with Honor and Chris the questions, and we can develop that.
3223018	3227584	B	0.8843622207641602	And we'll have that on the course, front end before the coming discussion.
3227712	3229344	B	0.8485442996025085	So thanks again, fellows.
3229392	3230500	B	0.6020334959030151	See you next time.
3230650	3231540	A	0.5137447118759155	Bye.
