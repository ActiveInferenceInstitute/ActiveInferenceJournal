57236	58010	13	B	0.9999	Thank you.
59820	60280	14	C	0.99989	Hello.
60350	62200	15	C	1	So I'll be the course assistant.
63180	70270	16	C	0.90021	I'm a postdoc in math, specializing in improbability, and I have a deep interest in the physics of information.
70640	74140	17	C	0.99	And I've been familiar with Chris's papers for a while.
74290	76190	18	C	0.99	So, yeah, just here to learn myself.
79460	80316	19	A	0.99837	Thank you, Andrew.
80348	81840	20	A	0.99	And thank you, Daniel.
82260	99300	21	A	0.87509	I'm Chris Fields and I'll be presenting this course in six sessions and Aguirre will be organizing discussion sessions after each of those.
99670	103380	22	A	1	And all of this is explained on the course website.
104730	108040	23	A	1	So let's start.
109210	126810	24	A	1	This is a course on physics as information processing, and this first session will be historical perspective on the idea that physics is or is about information processing.
127310	138478	25	A	0.67	And I'll just start with a few quotations that span the middle of the 20th century from Wittgenstein in 1920s saying the world is all that is the case.
138564	143490	26	A	0.82	So defining the world in terms of facts, not objects.
144390	149410	27	A	0.6993	Landauer in the early 60s proclaiming that information is physical.
150470	162102	28	A	1	And then John Archibald Wheeler, who in many ways is the grandfather of this era, recently stating it is it from Bit.
162236	167850	29	A	1	So things come from information, I E bitstrings.
168910	177180	30	A	1	And if nothing else, this shows that formulations of this idea get pithier as the 20th century rolls on.
178510	185390	31	A	0.67232	But the history goes back farther clearly than the 20th century.
185730	196354	32	A	0.99991	But I'm only going to really talk about a piece of it and the timeline that I'll actually discuss today.
196472	203090	33	A	0.67	The most relevant history of this idea goes back to the mid 19th century.
204330	211750	34	A	0.51	And the first specific thing I'll talk about is Clausia's definition of entropy.
212890	230750	35	A	0.99998	But with the beginning of the understanding of thermodynamics and the role of information in thermodynamics, you get this very interesting multidisciplinary progression of ideas that incorporates the beginning of quantum theory.
232850	252900	36	A	0.98	And the beginning of quantum theory can kind of be dated to the first Solve conference in 1928 and the famous debate between Bohr and Einstein over whether quantum theory is about knowledge, information or objects things.
254650	261186	37	A	0.99944	But it incorporates a lot of work in computer science and logic and mathematics.
261298	275062	38	A	1	So, interestingly, computer science was Born effectively in the mid 30s with the work of Church and Turing, which very rapidly converged with the work in physics.
275206	279530	39	A	1	So today we'll be talking about both computer science and physics.
280850	286880	40	A	1	And then in the second half of the 20th century, this just exploded into a huge area.
288050	303010	41	A	1	And in consequence of that mid 20th century development, we're beginning to see a new idea about physics which is roughly encapsulated in quantum information theory.
303350	305494	42	A	1	And the new idea is this.
305692	317686	43	A	0.9879	It's that what physics is actually about is information transfer across boundaries and the information we can represent.
317718	319978	44	A	1	The information transfer like this.
320144	323260	45	A	0.55	And this is a convention I'll use.
324030	326970	46	A	1	A boundary is always a blue ellipse.
328030	339360	47	A	1	And the agents that are exchanging information across this boundary are conventionally called Alice and Bob, which is just a more polite way of saying A and B.
340530	349890	48	A	0.88	And when you think about this picture, it becomes clear that what physics is really about is communication.
350950	365750	49	A	0.99	And this is a wild redescription of the idea of what physics is compared to the ideas of Newton or LaPlace or even the 19th century ideas.
366170	393810	50	A	0.61	And it's very different from the idea that's been preserved in 20th century physics in the lineage of Einstein and others who viewed classical physics as, in a sense, either as completely fundamental or as a fundamental adjunct to quantum theory.
394550	403090	51	A	1	So this way of thinking about physics is a very deeply quantum theoretic way of thinking about physics.
403670	411702	52	A	0.89	And where we're going in this course today is really how did this all happen?
411756	413400	53	A	0.85672	It's the origin story.
414650	435600	54	A	0.81	And then in the next session, I want to discuss quantum information theory explicitly and in particular, how quantum theory makes this conclusion that physics is about communication very simple and obvious, much more obvious than it is in classical physics where it takes work to formulate this idea.
436610	451060	55	A	1	Then in the next session, we're going to talk about semantics and how observations become meaningful to the agents who make them and hence how actions become meaningful to the agents who make them.
452230	465750	56	A	1	Then in August, we'll talk about communication theory a little bit more explicitly and talk about how agents employ multiple communication channels when they're communicating.
466410	475974	57	A	0.98	And this is obvious when you think of people communicating, they not only talk to each other, they look at the same things, they point to things, et cetera.
476022	479950	58	A	0.57	So this is what I mean by multiple communication channels.
480450	489210	59	A	1	Then in September, we'll leverage that discussion to talk about how spacetime actually emerges from communication.
489290	493854	60	A	1	And this is one of the most important aspects, I think, of quantum information theory.
493982	509960	61	A	1	It provides us with a way of viewing spacetime as an emergent phenomenon, that communication is what is fundamental in some ontological sense, and the box in which it happens, spacetime is not.
511050	523530	62	A	0.99	So the final session in October will talk about applications to biology via the free energy principle and future directions both in physics and biology and elsewhere.
524190	526294	63	A	1	So it's going to be an interesting ride.
526422	541150	64	A	0.59164	I'm keeping formalism to a minimum because we're directing this toward the broad array of people who are interested in active inference and who are involved with the Active Inference Institute.
541830	553250	65	A	0.96	And I would ask you to hold questions because we have a lot to get through in an hour for the interactive discussion and for the discussion forum.
554810	562470	66	A	0.99	So I hope I explain things well enough that all of the concepts will be understandable.
563450	570780	67	A	0.99989	If not, Wikipedia is actually a wonderful resource in this area for just definitions of terms.
571230	577894	68	A	1	So if there's anything that just a term that is a trip up, try Wikipedia.
577942	581006	69	A	0.9828	It's probably a very good source for what these terms mean.
581188	586990	70	A	0.81	So let's start our story, as I said, begins in the 19th century.
587410	596130	71	A	1	And in the mid 19th century, lots of physicists were devoting their efforts to figuring out how to make better steam engines.
596870	611282	72	A	0.91	And one question that arises when you're trying to design a steam engine is what happens physically when you add heat to a system at constant temperature?
611346	615350	73	A	1	So if you're building a steam engine, you've got a boiler, because you need to make steam.
615690	622330	74	A	1	And as you turn up the heat to your boiler, you get more steam, but the temperature doesn't change.
622480	624250	75	A	1	So this is a mystery.
625470	634670	76	A	0.99999	What is the heat actually adding to the boiler that is not increasing the temperature?
635810	644530	77	A	1	And Clausius responded to this question in a way that's sort of typical for a physicist or a mathematician.
645430	652478	78	A	0.99981	Since he didn't know what the answer was, he just invented a new name for whatever it was and gave it a formal definition.
652654	665270	79	A	1	So he called it entropy, which is a made up word that, if it was translated from the Greek, would roughly mean transformation content in trophy.
666250	683360	80	A	1	And he represented it by a simple equation that the change in this new concept entropy, which is always called S, is just equal to the change in heat Q at constant temperature t.
683730	700210	81	A	0.86	So obviously, this equation just reformulates the question in declarative form, saying whatever this stuff is, its changes in this stuff are just changes in heat at constant temperature.
700790	702580	82	A	0.63	Well, heat is energy.
702950	716066	83	A	0.54	And this wasn't completely recognized in the mid 19th century, but the way you'll see this equation in a current textbook is DS is the change in energy at constant temperature.
716258	724010	84	A	1	So even more commonly, you would see it written as the change in energy is equal to the temperature times the change in entropy.
724430	728950	85	A	0.5078	It's the most common sort of textbook way of seeing this.
729120	732010	86	A	0.9998	But the question, of course, is, what is this quantity?
732090	733498	87	A	0.99944	What is this entropy?
733594	735440	88	A	0.88144	What does this concept mean?
736450	753300	89	A	1	And about 15 years after Klausius proposed it, Boltzman had the key insight, which is that entropy is a measurement of our uncertainty about the state the system is in.
754490	773820	90	A	1	And in particular, he again, of course, went to formalism and said, the entropy S is equal to some constant times the number of states that the system can be in that look the same to us.
774750	782542	91	A	0.98	And since that number of states is enormous, the way to make that manageable is to take the log of the number of states.
782676	785310	92	A	1	The natural log is ln.
786050	790270	93	A	1	And this constant k is called Baltimore's constant.
791750	811080	94	A	1	And Baltimore was able to do this because he subscribed to a radical, very unpopular theory that material things, including gases like air, were made of atoms and heat made the atoms move around.
811770	816646	95	A	1	And as you increase the amount of heat, the atoms can move in many different ways.
816828	822010	96	A	1	So the number of states that they can be in that look the same to us increases.
822350	823914	97	A	1	And that's what entropy is.
823952	832622	98	A	0.97661	It's this increase in the number of states that the system can be in that all look the same to us with the measurements that we can make.
832676	837840	99	A	0.77	And since they look the same to us, we're uncertain about exactly what state they're in.
839250	841870	100	A	0.81	So entropy is a measure of uncertainty.
843190	846370	101	A	1	This was really the beginning of modern physics.
847510	855014	102	A	0.99988	Because what it says now is that decreasing uncertainty requires energy.
855212	859480	103	A	1	It links a measurement of uncertainty to a measurement of energy.
860490	871580	104	A	0.99	And if you think about the uncertainty principle in quantum theory, the core idea of the uncertainty principle is you can't measure a system without disturbing it.
872270	877914	105	A	1	So to actually act on a system requires energy.
878032	880400	106	A	1	And that's what you have to do to get information.
881330	885710	107	A	1	So here's Boltzman, basically, inventing quantum theory.
887490	892000	108	A	1	So we're going to fast forward by another 15 years, to 1900.
892850	903540	109	A	1	And in 1900, Planck solved this problem called the black body radiation problem, which was basically how much heat does your hot boiler give off into the air?
904490	918766	110	A	0.59	And all of the measurements of the heat that hot boilers gave off to the air ran into problems in classical physics and caused contradictions and quantities that went to infinity.
918818	920346	111	A	0.71	And all of that was bad.
920528	927078	112	A	1	So many people were trying to solve this problem, and Planck solved it by making a simple postulate.
927174	932570	113	A	0.89482	He said the energy of the radiation is proportional to its frequency.
932650	935440	114	A	1	So its color in the case of light.
935970	942154	115	A	1	And if you go higher frequency, you end up in ultraviolet and X rays and gamma rays.
942202	946740	116	A	0.99974	If you go to lower frequency, you go into microwaves and radio and all of that.
947670	951182	117	A	1	So this is a nice way of talking about radiation.
951326	953330	118	A	0.98	And it turned out that this solved the problem.
953400	963590	119	A	0.58	I mean, just assuming this simple proportionality relationship produced spectra for black body radiation that worked, that matched what you saw experimentally.
964250	965958	120	A	1	Well, this means something very important.
966044	972906	121	A	1	It means because this number h, the proportionality constant called plaque's constant, is a number.
973008	974198	122	A	0.99955	It's Finite.
974374	977930	123	A	0.96	It means that energy comes in discrete units of H.
978080	984080	124	A	0.94	You can have one H or two H or 10 million H, but you can't have half an H of energy.
985890	987290	125	A	1	So it's quantized.
987450	991230	126	A	0.8	And this is widely recognized as the birth of quantum theory.
991750	994580	127	A	0.99736	But of course, we should have known this already.
994950	997060	128	A	1	If we just thought a little bit.
997430	997890	129	A	0.94424	Right.
997960	1007110	130	A	0.99999	We Know that changes of energy are proportional to changes in entropy by temperature.
1007610	1016120	131	A	0.61	And we know that entropy is a measure of the number of states, and numbers of states are just numbers.
1016750	1028140	132	A	1	You can have one state, two states, three states, 10 million states, 100 billion states, but they're all just a number, one up.
1029310	1030486	133	A	0.96	And it's not infinite.
1030518	1035360	134	A	0.51849	There's not an infinite number of states unless you have an infinite amount of energy, which you don't have.
1036050	1040910	135	A	1	So we knew already that entropy could only take discrete values.
1041330	1048530	136	A	0.86	And since energy and entropy are basically the same thing, we knew already that energy could only take discrete values.
1049110	1057030	137	A	1	So we could have realized in 1900 that energy is quantized because the number of states is quantized.
1058410	1067446	138	A	1	So it shouldn't have really been a mystery why energy was quantized, but it was a mystery, and it stayed a mystery, and it said, still a mystery.
1067478	1091870	139	A	1	People still debate the meaning of quantum theory, but another thing we could have known in 1900 was something very important, and it's that this quantum of action, planck's constant, which has units of action, which is energy times time, is intimately related to Boltzman's constant.
1093510	1099970	140	A	1	And Boltzman's constant has units of energy over temperature.
1101910	1106020	141	A	0.91475	But this wasn't actually understood until the 1950s.
1106870	1109158	142	A	0.99999	No one really figured that this out.
1109244	1112214	143	A	0.99999	There was this relation until the 1950s.
1112412	1117290	144	A	1	And when it was figured out, it was figured out by a guy named Jean Carlo Wick.
1117710	1129930	145	A	1	And he introduced this notion of the Wick rotation by realizing that if you have an equation in classical physics, and in it, there's the term one over KT.
1130910	1135658	146	A	1	You can always replace that one over KT with this other expression.
1135754	1137150	147	A	0.94	It over h bar.
1137220	1143250	148	A	0.94	H bar is just h divided by two pi, and you'll get an equation that's valid in quantum theory.
1143910	1147730	149	A	0.96	And this is typically described in textbooks as a trick.
1148310	1154760	150	A	0.99	And whenever something in physics is described as a trick, what that really means is it's something we don't understand.
1156650	1161030	151	A	1	And lots of papers have been written about the meaning of the WIC rotation.
1162890	1169980	152	A	0.73487	But to start to understand the WIC rotation, I want to look at this equation a little bit.
1171790	1183134	153	A	1	One over KT is one over in energy, and it over h bar is one over in energy.
1183252	1197250	154	A	0.99788	Since h bar is units of energy times time, we have time in this equation, and then we have this factor, I, which is typically thought of as just an imaginary number.
1197400	1199940	155	A	1	So it's the square root of minus one.
1200550	1203358	156	A	1	And what's this I doing in this equation?
1203454	1206454	157	A	1	And in fact, you see factors of it over h bar.
1206492	1211698	158	A	0.99999	If you're familiar with quantum theory everywhere in quantum theory.
1211874	1216040	159	A	1	So what's the meaning of this imaginary number?
1217230	1234670	160	A	0.75	And if you just think of it or of I as this arbitrary imaginary number that somehow renders the equation mysterious, then the whole of quantum theory is mysterious, but the Wick rotation is very mysterious.
1235250	1238990	161	A	0.99996	But what I is actually is an operator.
1239970	1246910	162	A	0.61	And if you think of the real numbers as an axis, which is always drawn horizontally.
1246990	1248082	163	A	1	So here it is.
1248216	1252482	164	A	0.98317	Here's zero, and the axis is pointing that way.
1252536	1256326	165	A	0.93981	I'm sorry, I can't get the camera really far enough away to see my arm here.
1256508	1258070	166	A	1	So what is I?
1258220	1265190	167	A	0.91	I is actually an operator that rotates the whole real axis by 90 degrees.
1265690	1272954	168	A	0.9	So if you see a plot of complex numbers, then the real numbers go this way, and the, quote, imaginary numbers go that way.
1272992	1277638	169	A	1	So what multiplying by I has done is rotate by 90 degrees.
1277814	1286400	170	A	0.67	And of course, if you do I squared, you rotate twice by 90 degrees by arm would do this, but you end up pointing that way, and those are the negative numbers.
1286930	1297358	171	A	1	So I is an operator that rotates something by 90 degrees, and if you rotate four times by 90 degrees, you're back to the identity.
1297534	1299780	172	A	1	So I to the fourth is one.
1300950	1308950	173	A	1	So this tells us something very interesting, which is that what the WIC rotation is really talking about is a rotation.
1309770	1312230	174	A	0.77195	It's a geometrical equation.
1313290	1322410	175	A	0.7	And in July, we'll come back to this and really probe what this Wick rotation means physically.
1324990	1332640	176	A	0.99991	But as I said, this wasn't understood to the 1950s, and by the 1950s, a lot had happened.
1333010	1334954	177	A	1	So quantum theory had been developed.
1335002	1336922	178	A	0.35752	Bohren Einstein had had their debate.
1336986	1338814	179	A	0.52206	Particle accelerators had been built.
1338852	1340574	180	A	1	The atomic bomb had been built.
1340692	1349794	181	A	0.9943	Nuclear physics was well in its way, so an enormous amount of practical physics had been done.
1349912	1351966	182	A	0.81637	Quantum theory was highly developed.
1351998	1360310	183	A	1	People were starting to think about quantum field theory before they made this simple realization that's formulated in the Wick rotation.
1360650	1363240	184	A	1	So this is a harboring of things to come.
1363610	1372060	185	A	1	But before we continue in physics, we need to backtrack in time a little bit and look at what the mathematicians were doing.
1373150	1385146	186	A	0.99	So across the hall in the math department, one year after the Solve conference in 1929, kurt Godel proved his famous first incompleteness theorem.
1385338	1391280	187	A	1	And the theorem states that no formal system that contains arithmetic can be both consistent and complete.
1392630	1405880	188	A	1	And that means that either there are true statements that aren't provable in the formal system, or there are false statements that are provable, or, of course, both.
1406810	1411878	189	A	0.62	And Godel's proof is actually extremely simple.
1411964	1428010	190	A	0.99659	Almost all of the work in the proof is setting up all of the notation and procedures and so forth to formulate within arithmetic the sentence, this sentence is not provable.
1429090	1436800	191	A	0.52	And once you have that sentence formulated within arithmetic, then the conclusion of the proof is obvious.
1437250	1443890	192	A	0.7686	If you can prove the sentence, this sentence is not provable, then you've proved something that's false.
1444230	1450686	193	A	1	And if you can't prove it, then there are sentences that you can't prove in arithmetic.
1450878	1473686	194	A	1	So this was incredibly bad news for mathematicians who thought that finite discrete operations, which is what proofs are and also what computations are, can exhaustively enumerate the facts and this was the assumption behind Wittgenstein's claim that the world is all that is the case, the world is a collection of facts.
1473878	1483600	195	A	0.82	And optimistically, he thought that first order logic would allow us to enumerate all those facts and we'd be done dreams of a final theory again.
1485970	1496690	196	A	0.68	So Godel's Theorem means that no system with finite capabilities, no system that can just do finite discrete operations, can fully describe its environment.
1497110	1503810	197	A	1	It will always be in an environment where there are true things that aren't provable or false things that are provable.
1504890	1512040	198	A	0.99635	But I think more relative to a discussion of agents is that it means that no agent can describe itself.
1512970	1528540	199	A	0.99999	Any agent's theory of itself will either contain true statements that it can't derive or false statements, or it will either miss true statements that it can't derive or wind up deriving things that are false about itself.
1529410	1532320	200	A	1	Of course, we see this in psychology all the time.
1533410	1544190	201	A	1	So an immediate consequence of Godel's Theorem was an intense investigation of what computation actually is, what it meant to talk about finite discrete operations.
1544850	1548782	202	A	0.76	And two leaders of this were, of course, Church and Turing.
1548846	1560440	203	A	1	And here's a picture of a Turing machine, which is just a little device with a couple of tapes and a tape reader and a simple logic unit that either writes a one or a zero if it sees a one or a zero.
1561450	1577530	204	A	1	And they defined a computation as a process that can be implemented in finite time by such a machine or by Church's lambda calculus or by any of the now hundreds of other methods that are provably equivalent to a Turing machine.
1578030	1579820	205	A	1	So what does this mean?
1580270	1589200	206	A	1	It means that computation is a physical process that can be mechanized and it turns out, mechanized in any one of a huge array of ways.
1590050	1594846	207	A	1	It means that many different implementations of any computation are possible.
1594948	1600530	208	A	1	So I can do it on a Turing machine, I can do it on my laptop, I can do it on my head, et cetera.
1601270	1605554	209	A	0.95	The most important things it means is that there are questions with no computable answer.
1605672	1608306	210	A	1	This is the Revenge of Godel's theorem.
1608498	1613798	211	A	0.87	And two of the most famous questions of this kind are given some arbitrary program.
1613884	1614882	212	A	0.9992	Will it halt?
1615026	1617578	213	A	0.99957	Will it get to an answer in finite time?
1617744	1622410	214	A	0.52	And the answer to that question is this is undecidable.
1622750	1625260	215	A	0.99998	No procedure can figure this out.
1626270	1634670	216	A	1	And the other undecidable question is, given some arbitrary program, what function does it compute?
1635090	1640730	217	A	1	And you'd think that would be simple, that you can read a program and figure out what function it computes.
1640890	1643502	218	A	0.76663	But it turns out that is undecidable.
1643646	1647620	219	A	0.96	That cannot be done by any finite process.
1649270	1659990	220	A	1	So this was another body blow to the goal of understanding everything with finite discrete processes.
1660330	1663366	221	A	0.99997	But it also set the stage for something new.
1663548	1676380	222	A	0.88	It set the stage for thinking about an agent who interacts with a computational process by giving it an input and then looking at its output sometime later.
1678110	1686590	223	A	1	And this, of course, will look familiar because I've included the blue ellipse, which is the boundary, which these days we call a user interface.
1687490	1697700	224	A	0.75	And the user interface just allows some finite action on the system and then the ability to observe some finite response by the system.
1698150	1707574	225	A	0.89	So we can now ask what can Alice determine by acting in some finite way and then making some finite number of observations I.
1707612	1708200	226	A	0.89	E.
1708650	1713880	227	A	0.90827	Receiving some finite number of outputs from the system that she's acting on.
1715850	1722326	228	A	1	And the first 20 years of this produced a large number of answers, all of them negative.
1722518	1731070	229	A	1	So to go back to Turing, he proved that Alice can't tell what's implementing the function that she sees being implemented.
1731970	1737002	230	A	0.99999	She can't tell whether a given input will lead to an output.
1737066	1738560	231	A	0.99996	That's the halting problem.
1740130	1745380	232	A	0.36256	Shannon showed that Alice can't tell what the inputs mean to the system.
1746390	1751330	233	A	1	His whole theory of communication is completely independent of semantics.
1751910	1758470	234	A	0.94	And his theory of communication actually accurately describes what Alice can observe.
1759930	1769130	235	A	0.98821	Rice is the one who proved that you can't determine what program is generating the outputs.
1769950	1780510	236	A	1	And then Moore proved a very similar result in a completely different formal setting of general cybernetics that you can't tell what process is generating the outputs by finite observation.
1781570	1793950	237	A	0.99998	But what Alice can do is build a predictive model of what generates the output she sees in response to her inputs and test it by designing new inputs.
1794370	1800930	238	A	0.94	And this is, of course, as Karl Popper told us, the process that we call science.
1801430	1807080	239	A	1	So Alice can do science even though she can't answer any of these fundamental questions.
1810010	1824730	240	A	1	Now, this, of course, has a huge technological consequence since this theory of computation tells us that processes are effectively virtual.
1826430	1831306	241	A	0.99999	We don't know what they are and we can't determine what they are except in theory.
1831418	1841600	242	A	0.99998	By making a theory technologically, it means we're free to use virtualization everywhere because we have to deal with it anyway.
1842470	1845758	243	A	1	And this allows us to build multilevel architectures.
1845854	1855960	244	A	1	It means that we can architect computers where no layer of the computation has any idea what's going on below or above it and doesn't need to.
1857290	1860520	245	A	1	And that's what makes practical programming possible.
1861130	1878780	246	A	1	So from these no go theorems that tell you what you can't do, you actually get an enormous boost into it and use to probe the world and develop theories and on and on and on.
1880290	1891680	247	A	0.98	So in a sense, Godel birthed not only computer science, but practical computing by showing us that virtualization is just the way the world works.
1892150	1908230	248	A	0.9	So now let's go back to physics where these ideas were replicated, basically reintroduced, reinvented by Feynman in developing his path integral formulation of quantum theory.
1908570	1921882	249	A	1	And basically what Feyman realized was that in any physical process, the observer Alice prepares some state that she's interested in.
1921936	1924730	250	A	0.99996	She prepares some input to an experiment.
1925230	1932080	251	A	1	Then she lets something happen, and then she sees what the result of the experiment is.
1932450	1936110	252	A	1	And the canonical experiment in physics is scattering.
1936450	1944420	253	A	1	You fire two protons at each other, and they intersect someplace, and stuff comes out, and you measure the stuff that comes out.
1944950	1952580	254	A	1	And what you can measure is momentum and spin energy, things like that position.
1953510	1961762	255	A	0.97	So these processes conserve the total values of the things you can measure.
1961826	1974940	256	A	0.94	So in particular, they preserve momentum and angular momentum, and they preserve other things that are harder to measure and are only approximately conserved anyway, like Lepton number.
1975710	1996020	257	A	0.88767	But Feynman's contribution to this way of thinking about experiments was to say, look, if you want to understand the output, you have to sum over all of the possible processes that could have produced the output from the input, no matter how improbable they are.
1996790	2016370	258	A	1	So the famous idea from Feynman diagrams is if you have an electron that's scattering off an atom, you measure the initial state of the electron that you've generated with an accelerator or something, and you measure the final state, which involves momentum and spin and so forth.
2016530	2035120	259	A	0.51	And for all you knew, partway through the process, the electron disappeared, and an entire universe appeared and then annihilated with a copy of an entire anti universe, and the electron came back out.
2035730	2043570	260	A	0.57	And you have to include processes like that if you really want to understand and correctly predict the outcomes of your measurements.
2044230	2056274	261	A	0.69	And Murray Gelman lifted the bumper sticker slogan from Th White and the once and Future King everything not explicitly forbidden is mandatory.
2056322	2058520	262	A	1	That sums up Feynman's idea.
2060090	2072490	263	A	1	And this is called the totalitarian principle, since it's what's written in Th White's book on the kingdom of the ants, for which everything not explicitly forbidden is mandatory.
2073550	2080026	264	A	1	So let's think about a real example that's a bit actually, it's the same as scattering.
2080058	2085470	265	A	1	The ultimate scattering experiment in physics is a black hole.
2086610	2091840	266	A	0.98415	Stuff goes into the horizon, stars, whole galaxies, whatever.
2092710	2096322	267	A	0.99999	Something happens, and stuff comes out.
2096376	2110840	268	A	0.59	And what comes out is Hawking radiation, and information is conserved if the information in the Hawking radiation is actually the same as the information in the stuff that went in.
2111770	2115650	269	A	0.97	And conservation is not qualitative.
2115730	2116910	270	A	0.99099	It's quantitative.
2117010	2121130	271	A	0.99975	It's only the quantity of information that's supposed to be preserved.
2121790	2130270	272	A	1	And you can ask, how much is the information that's being emitted by a black hole that's emitting Hawking radiation?
2130930	2137658	273	A	0.66	And Beckenstein was the one who figured this out, using an incredibly simple argument.
2137834	2140160	274	A	0.99998	But I'll just give the answer here.
2140530	2162920	275	A	1	The answer is that the total entropy of the black hole is its area divided by four, and the area in this equation has to be computed in Planck units, which are units where Planck's constant and the speed of light and boltzman's constant and other interesting things are all set equal to one.
2164170	2172810	276	A	1	So one Planck area is the Planck length squared, which turns out to be about ten to the minus squared.
2173470	2178460	277	A	0.92	So this is that black holes are the most entropic entities we know of.
2178930	2199730	278	A	0.52	So a black hole about this big with a radius of about a meter has an entropy of about ten to the 70th, which is, of course, an astonishingly big number, and a black hole with the area of the sun.
2199880	2212440	279	A	0.96	So a moderate sized cosmological black hole, a real thing that we can observe with a gravity wave telescope or something, has an entropy of about ten to the 79th.
2212810	2224300	280	A	1	And really big black holes, which are bigger than the entire solar system, have entropies into the ten to the something.
2225070	2228650	281	A	1	So these are enormously entropic entities.
2230930	2233998	282	A	0.57498	But Beckenstein didn't just tell us that.
2234084	2240830	283	A	0.99994	He told us something about the structure of the interface, the horizon of a black hole.
2241510	2243700	284	A	0.84	And this is what he told us.
2246790	2256950	285	A	0.83	You can compute entropy in bits just by using logs, base two instead of logs based e, natural logs.
2257370	2263560	286	A	1	And that's just multiplying the natural log by about 1.4.
2264810	2272620	287	A	0.54	So we can write the entropy of black hole, of black hole in units of bits, and it's about a over six.
2273630	2280270	288	A	0.99	So what does this mean to say that we can think of the entropy in terms of bits?
2280610	2308690	289	A	0.99786	What it says is that we can think of the interface in terms of a bit array, and we can think of all of these bits as encoded on this interface at a density of one bit every roughly six plank lengths squared, six plank areas.
2308850	2312470	290	A	0.84	So this is an incredibly dense encoding in a black hole.
2314650	2317014	291	A	0.64	And it's an interesting idea about black holes.
2317062	2321498	292	A	0.99964	But what gets really interesting is what happens when you generalize it.
2321584	2327260	293	A	0.58	And of course, physicists are prone to generalization, and that's what happened next.
2330110	2337150	294	A	0.50864	Gerard to Hooft, almost immediately thereafter, on the basis of Beckenstein's work, formulated the Holographic principle.
2337730	2346050	295	A	0.99	And what the Holographic principle says is we can think of any system as approximately a black hole.
2346870	2350210	296	A	1	And the only approximation is the encoding density.
2350950	2361042	297	A	0.54	The boundary of any system encodes the information that we can get about the system at some density.
2361106	2366150	298	A	0.62	And the density is less than the density for a black hole because we're not black holes.
2367370	2379130	299	A	1	And this rules out a lot by limiting the amount of information that you can extract from a system to the amount of information that you can actually write on its boundary.
2379790	2385406	300	A	0.59	And one of the things that it rules out is knowing the geometry on the inside of the system.
2385588	2402034	301	A	1	And to Hoof put it this way, which I think is a brilliant thought experiment, he says, look, the metric inside this system can be so curved, effectively the space time inside the system can be so curved that you could stick an entire universe inside.
2402232	2409750	302	A	1	And we never know because it wouldn't change the amount of entropy number of bits that are encoded on the boundary.
2410650	2413494	303	A	1	So the inside geometry can be anything.
2413692	2415414	304	A	1	And you can't find out by.
2415452	2417740	305	A	0.58	Looking at the outside of the system.
2418990	2424010	306	A	1	Now, the Holographic principle almost follows from classical physics.
2425630	2440670	307	A	0.9996	There's Euler's theorem, which tells you about one over R squared forces, and you can think of the force as penetrating the boundary at some density.
2441250	2451330	308	A	1	And the difference between Euler's theorem and the Holographic principle is just that the density in classical physics can go to infinity.
2451990	2460466	309	A	1	And in the Holographic principle, it can only go to this maximal density that's achieved by a black hole.
2460658	2461110	310	A	0.99893	Why?
2461180	2469100	311	A	0.99812	Because if you try to get any higher, more information, the information gets sucked into the black hole, and you can't get it out.
2471390	2484560	312	A	0.89	So the Holographic principle becomes a guiding principle for thinking about any physical system and what it means to extract information from a physical system.
2485330	2488974	313	A	1	And in fact, we'll talk about this next time.
2489172	2495060	314	A	1	You can say exactly what the information encoded on the boundary of any system is.
2496790	2513106	315	A	0.99	And what I'll go through next time is seeing that the information that's encoded on the boundary is a specification of the energy that's being exchanged by the interaction, which, of course, is linear in the number of bits.
2513138	2515830	316	A	0.99326	It's just counting the number of bits.
2517230	2517980	317	A	0.98957	Okay?
2518350	2539630	318	A	1	So with the Holographic principle, we now have a complete new science about systems that are exchanging finite discrete information across a boundary by encoding that information on the boundary and then reading the information off the boundary.
2540370	2545650	319	A	0.96	So here's a new way of thinking about physical interaction.
2545990	2558658	320	A	0.54337	Alice writes a message on her boundary with Bob, and Bob reads the message off the boundary and then writes his own new message, which Alice then reads.
2558834	2562280	321	A	1	And of course, that's what's happening right now.
2562970	2570886	322	A	0.89382	I'm writing information by speaking on an interface, which is effectively the Internet.
2571078	2576250	323	A	0.51	And you're reading that information off the Internet by listening to it.
2576400	2584030	324	A	0.99	And when we get time for questions, you'll be writing information on the Internet, which I'll be reading.
2585250	2589658	325	A	1	Now, the key thing about this new science is that it's topological.
2589754	2596942	326	A	0.92417	It's about connectivity across some communication channel, which we represent as a boundary.
2597086	2602930	327	A	0.88605	It's not geometric, so it doesn't assume anything about spacetime.
2604090	2613030	328	A	1	So it allows us to build a model of space in particular as an emergent phenomenon.
2613370	2627100	329	A	1	And it allows us to see time as not some absolute external abstraction, but something that the communicating agents measure for themselves.
2628430	2631920	330	A	0.68	And so they each act in their own time.
2633090	2640906	331	A	1	And we get a very natural measure of time in terms of how many bits I see coming across my boundary.
2640938	2651250	332	A	0.79	And again, we'll talk about that in the next couple of sessions and then talk about it more thoroughly in September when we talk about emergent spacetime.
2652230	2664882	333	A	1	So quantum information theory looks very different from the physics that came before, not because it's adopted a new formalism, the tools of quantum theory.
2665026	2681840	334	A	0.99661	It's because it's entirely changed the thinking about what physics is and what it's about and replace this idea of forces and balls banging into each other and all of that with the idea of communication between agents.
2682530	2687310	335	A	1	And of course that's familiar from an active inference perspective.
2687890	2695710	336	A	1	So we can now back up a little bit to see what they were doing in classical physics during this period.
2695790	2697682	337	A	0.99	Well, let me go on a little bit.
2697736	2698340	338	A	0.99998	Sorry.
2702070	2714226	339	A	1	This is just a slide quoting Wheeler, who of course is the most radical in terms of impitheist, in terms of formulating these ideas.
2714418	2718250	340	A	0.78704	But here's his characterization of this new physics.
2718830	2720490	341	A	0.95335	It's not reductive.
2721630	2723930	342	A	0.96	All of the reasoning is circular.
2725230	2731630	343	A	1	You don't have smaller things and then yet smaller things, and then yet smaller things forever.
2733090	2734510	344	A	0.97836	There are no laws.
2736690	2741070	345	A	1	So what you see on the interface is a message.
2741220	2747090	346	A	0.99988	It's not something that's governed by laws since the beginning of the universe.
2747830	2749406	347	A	0.9996	There's no continuum.
2749518	2752050	348	A	1	So there's nothing described by real numbers.
2752120	2753930	349	A	0.89753	It's all described by integers.
2754030	2756710	350	A	0.99689	Everything's done in finite dimensional spaces.
2757050	2762280	351	A	0.63	And finally, and most importantly, there's no spacetime box in which things happen.
2762810	2766294	352	A	0.99	So think of how radical this is means.
2766332	2773290	353	A	0.99994	There's no big bang, there's no big rip, there's no bouncing universe.
2773870	2779290	354	A	1	All of those ideas are out the window because they're classical and they're about spacetime.
2779970	2787390	355	A	0.92	And what the new physics wants to do is derive spacetime out of basically users experiences.
2788850	2796142	356	A	0.99	So the agents here are all observer participants in Wheeler's language.
2796206	2804450	357	A	0.99999	But what that just means is agents that want to communicate and it's their communication that gives rise to physics.
2805850	2818810	358	A	0.99	So now we'll go back to classical physics and what was happening, or one thing that was happening in classical physics at that time was a lot of thinking about stochastic causal networks.
2819630	2835130	359	A	1	And Pearl realized that if you have any stochastic causal network that's unidirectional, then around any node, you can draw what he called a Markov blanket.
2835290	2857080	360	A	0.78	And a Markov blanket is just the set of nodes in the network that absorb all outside causation and then transmit that causation into whatever node you're interested in and then absorb all causation coming from the node you're interested in and transmit it to the rest of the world.
2857770	2864642	361	A	0.99	And so we can redraw that in Part B here, and it should look very familiar.
2864706	2869900	362	A	0.65	A Markov blanket is just a classical physics way of talking about a Holographic screen.
2870670	2884874	363	A	0.91	And the number of nodes in the Markov blanket, or in particular the number of degrees of freedom times the number of nodes, is just the number of bits that flow across that Markov blanket.
2884922	2889520	364	A	1	So it's the entropy of the effective Holographic screen.
2892390	2898210	365	A	1	All these ideas were reinvented more or less independently within classical physics.
2898950	2921960	366	A	0.82	And it was from this classical physics background that Karl Freston came up with the idea that a Markov blanket defines a persistence, at least from an active inference institute point of view everyone is familiar with, because it's the foundation of the idea of active inference.
2924620	2936140	367	A	0.97464	Any system that persists through time does so by making sure that it doesn't dissolve into its environment.
2936560	2938284	368	A	0.41	Well, what does that mean?
2938482	2947040	369	A	1	It means it persists through time by maintaining the integrity of its Markov blanket or the integrity of its boundary.
2947620	2967380	370	A	1	So this of course is just a tautology, but it's a very interesting and very productive tautology because it says that any system is using the information it gets on its boundary from its environment to build a model of how its environment behaves.
2967960	2975690	371	A	0.81	And then it uses that model to act back on its environment to test and refine its model.
2976380	2980490	372	A	1	And again, as Popper told us, this is just what science is.
2981120	2989470	373	A	1	So what the free energy principle really tells us is that all systems are agents that are doing science all the time.
2990400	3011060	374	A	1	So physics is effectively not just the study of communication, but it's the study of agents doing science with each other, pairs of agents who are trying to figure each other out by their communicative exchanges.
3012200	3043020	375	A	0.55	So that's the history of how we got from 1930s sorry, 1850s thermodynamics to the free energy principle and how the free energy principle connects to these very deep and extremely radical, especially within context ideas in quantum theory and quantum cosmology and computer science.
3043540	3079560	376	A	1	All of which tell us that the world we see is a projection that's being written on our boundaries by a process that we have no access to except the procedure of active inference or the procedure of science, which is to formulate predictive models and test them by doing things in the world and seeing how the world responds.
3081360	3085260	377	A	0.53	So that's it for this session.
3087200	3097250	378	A	1	The first discussion session which Andrew is going to lead will be the 3 June at this same time, I E 05:00 European time.
3098180	3102960	379	A	1	And then my session number two will be in mid June.
3103700	3111910	380	A	0.68	And if you look at the course website, there's this subsidiary website for interactive Q and A.
3112360	3132060	381	A	1	And I invite everyone to post questions and discuss them and hope that we'll have an interesting exchange and that everyone will come to sort of an understanding of what was talked about today through discussion.
3132560	3140888	382	A	0.99	And we'll be interested in being back in June to see how to formulate this in quantum theory.
3140984	3151424	383	A	1	So thank you very much and thank you again, Daniel, for organizing this and hosting it and putting together all the technical things necessary to pull this off.
3151622	3153570	384	A	0.97	I could never do that on my own.
3155140	3155744	385	B	0.99996	Thank you.
3155782	3158550	386	B	0.99935	We're really excited here.
3159560	3160816	387	B	0.99992	Any closing thoughts?
3160848	3165140	388	B	0.79	Or andrew, I'd love to hear your reflection just briefly.
3166120	3172570	389	B	0.99998	How would you have told that history or how does that history reflect on the areas that you're familiar with?
3174380	3176890	390	C	1	Well, I don't think I have much to add.
3178860	3183176	391	C	0.9325	I've been mainly interested in the weak rotation part.
3183278	3187020	392	C	0.40012	I'm excited to hear more about that, Chris.
3188240	3192620	393	C	0.99773	But no, I found this to be a very nice summary.
3193040	3208710	394	C	0.998	I'm less familiar with the staff on computation, formal computation, despite being a mathematician by training, it was a little more familiar with all the physics stuff, but yeah, I thought it was great.
3209400	3210436	395	A	0.99865	Thank you.
3210618	3211508	396	A	0.87	All right.
3211674	3212244	397	B	0.99959	Thank you.
3212282	3213396	398	B	1	I will close it.
3213418	3216320	399	B	1	So in about two weeks, we'll have the first discussion.
3216400	3218272	400	B	0.95016	Everyone's welcome to join.
3218416	3222996	401	B	0.99	I will share with Honor and Chris the questions, and we can develop that.
3223018	3227584	402	B	1	And we'll have that on the course, front end before the coming discussion.
3227712	3229344	403	B	1	So thanks again, fellows.
3229392	3230500	404	B	0.97147	See you next time.
3230650	3231540	405	A	0.56011	Bye.
