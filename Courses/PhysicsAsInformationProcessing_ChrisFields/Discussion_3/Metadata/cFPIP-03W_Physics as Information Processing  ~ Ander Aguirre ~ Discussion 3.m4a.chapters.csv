2490	90520	00:02	We're having a follow up discussion on Chris Fields's third lecture on quantum reference frames. If you're watching on YouTube, you can write any questions or comments in the live chat. If there's any questions that appear, we can address those.	This is a follow up discussion on Chris Fields's third lecture on quantum reference frames	Quantum reference frames
91230	530630	01:31	What would it mean for information to be fungible or non fungible? I think it basically comes down to whether you can replicate. It's basically the difference between classical and quantum information. Dean, what do you think?	What would it mean for information to be fungible or non fungible	Quantum Information: Non-Fluorability
532680	1088536	08:52	One of the glaring omissions in physics was the embodiment of the reference frame. It's becoming an important thing in the last 20 years, this attempt to really explicitly treat thereference frame and the observer as a quantum entity, as a physical entity.	One of the glaring omissions in physics was the embodiment of the reference frame	Quantum reference frames as a physical entity
1088718	1279190	18:08	Where does this tension between increasing complexity and wanting to predict what the environment is doing? One requires entanglement and the other one requires separability. How this is related to emergent space and these QRS stuff.	There is a tension between increasing complexity and accuracy prediction	Tension between increasing complexity and accuracy prediction
1282120	1843210	21:22	QRFs are almost building blocks, if you want, for information processing. For a difference to make a difference, what do you want out of QRF? You need a QRF to have sensory action and a default state. These three things will give you a building block for any informationprocessing.	QRFs are almost building blocks for information processing, if you want	Quantum information processing (QRF)
1844380	2263670	30:44	QRFs in the formalism have to be attached to a boundary boundary degrees of freedom. Time has to be internal to the observer. Trade off can be both ad hoc and post hoc at the same time.	QRFs in quantum free energy formalism have to be attached to boundary	Quantum Free Energy Theory, Explicit embodiment
2264120	2439220	37:44	Dean Baker: Is it a perception action loop or is it an action perception loop? Baker: If it can be, that would really move us out of the classical realm. He says we want to be able to change our minds. Baker: It certainly makes for a lot of waste heat if you're not careful.	Dean: The Action perception loop is ambiguous. So is it a perception action loop or is it an action perception loop	Inference and the Action Perception Loop
2442090	2702460	40:42	If we don't have an attention control compartment, we cannot play with all these QRFs that are non commutative at the same time. Environment sector has to be further broken down into pointer and reference estates. If you're going to identify a system, you need a background that puts the system in context.	The environment sector has to be further broken down into pointer and reference estates	Quantum systems and the non-commutative theory
2702620	2804560	45:02	Daniel: This is possibly the most interesting picture in this presentation. The possibilities for KrF alignment and how free energy comes into play. Depending on each possibility, you're going to see things as noise or non local hidden variables. Once all the curves are aligned, you have entanglement.	This presentation summarizes the possibilities for KrF alignment and how free energy comes into play	KrF alignment and entanglement
2805570	3155356	46:45	Minimizing variational, free energy leads you to entanglements. There is a tension between this tendency towards alignment and the other side of the free energy functional where systems increase in complexity. I foresee interest in discussions and lectures that deal with the concept of emergent space.	Daniel: What does the free energy principle say in this quantum setting	Quantum Free Energy Principle and its implications
3155548	3618630	52:35	Dean: What happens when the agent becomes identical to the environment? Is this a state even possible? Would it be thermodynamical equilibrium maximum entanglement? Dean: This whole idea of emergent space is going to be one of the most important in the course of the class.	Question: What happens when the agent becomes identical to the environment	Quantum Free Energy Principle and Thermal Equilibrium
3620440	3906290	1:00:20	On this trade off frontier of in our pursuit of unitarity, will we blur to unify or will we differentiate to unite? We could actually also have integrated information through increased articulation, not just decreased.	I'll try with another speculative fiction. It's a holographic screen	Generalized Synchrony in the Computer
3913720	4068160	1:05:13	There could be some very powerful and interesting linguistic opportunities for updating our speaking to reflect what we are learning here. How to actually reenter some of these formalisms into our focus understanding could just be immensely powerful. Dean, any penultimate thoughts?	There could be some very powerful linguistic opportunities for updating our speaking	Language: Its fine-tuning
4070370	4196830	1:07:50	Ander and Dean, we're halfway through the third discussion section of the course. I encourage people to check out the course website and submit questions that they'd like to see addressed by Chris. Also to register and join these participatory discussions.	Dean: We just completed the third discussion section now, so we've had three lectures	Halfway through the QRF
