2490	3040	A	0.546256959438324	You.
5970	7294	B	0.872096598148346	Hello and welcome.
7412	21386	B	0.8747055530548096	It's July 29, 2023, and we're here in session three discussion of the course physics's Information Processing at the Active Inference Institute.
21578	32098	B	0.9161737561225891	We're having a follow up discussion on Chris Fields's third lecture on quantum reference frames, and we're looking forward to your participation.
32274	37942	B	0.7447075247764587	So if you're watching along live and you've been invited to the calendar event, it's not too late to jump in.
38076	45686	B	0.912116527557373	If you're watching on YouTube, you can write any questions or comments in the live chat with Dean And.
45708	57594	B	0.6902891993522644	Ander here we're going to be looking at some of the key points and taking it in a few different directions, sharing our reference frames, making a shared one.
57712	74114	B	0.8666399121284485	So, Andrew, would be awesome to have you zoom in a little bit on the slide and then feel free to take us through some of the key points so that we can see a little bit how you're seeing it.
74152	74900	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
75670	76754	A	0.9770011305809021	That looks good.
76872	77540	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
78070	86882	A	0.869983434677124	Okay, so let's start by reviewing the last lecture from a couple of weeks ago, and then we can open up the discussions.
86946	90520	A	0.8926761150360107	If there's any questions that appear in the live chat, we can address those.
91230	91802	A	0.4896698594093323	All right.
91856	115398	A	0.8226678967475891	So lecture two, Chris introduced this idea of the information processing between system A and B, where they interact via qubits on a boundary, and they have reference frames that give meaning to this communication.
115594	125380	A	0.877007007598877	You want to think of information processing as a communication channel, the way Shannon thought about it.
126230	127890	A	0.8414669632911682	So that was in lecture two.
128040	140246	A	0.8089027404785156	And lecture three a couple weeks ago tried to make this more explicit by emphasizing the idea that this has to be physically embodied somewhere.
140358	140874	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
140992	164990	A	0.5145233273506165	And I think that because we are so used to information being fungible in no small part because of the Internet and everything, it's a little hard to understand at first when the claim is made that you have a QRF that it's non fungible or you have a piece of quantum information that's non fungible or things like the no Cloning theorem.
165590	180550	A	0.5853714942932129	We're so used to information being fungible, to it being zeros and ones that it's a bit of a change in mindset at first, but that's exactly what lecture three introduced.
181130	183640	A	0.7012985348701477	This was all stuff, right?
184010	186198	B	0.8060964345932007	Could you maybe just unpack that a little bit?
186284	189522	B	0.8717893958091736	What would it mean for information to be fungible?
189586	191350	B	0.8581576943397522	Or what's that stance like?
191420	194182	B	0.7111390829086304	And then, what does it mean for information to be non fungible?
194246	196060	B	0.8468148708343506	And what is that stance like?
196830	199578	A	0.7180318832397461	Yeah, I'm out to get there.
199664	203854	A	0.8547386527061462	So let me scroll down the slides, because that's addressed here.
203892	211886	A	0.7100021243095398	So maybe I should have kept this in the beginning, but anyways, session two talked about how information theory makes this simple and obvious.
211988	212640	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
213570	220980	A	0.8704239130020142	And in session three, we talk about reference frames and mechanistically, how all of this works.
222710	230022	A	0.8589629530906677	So, yeah, let's address that question of the difference between hold on 1 second.
230076	233320	A	0.8821973204612732	Let me use my mouse to scroll down here.
235530	237346	A	0.6074394583702087	Okay, so that's a little faster.
237378	237960	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
239370	240120	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
242110	244118	A	0.8712119460105896	Can you restate your question, Daniel?
244214	244474	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
244512	248970	B	0.886479377746582	What would it mean for information to be fungible or non fungible?
249470	257390	B	0.8482733368873596	People might be familiar with that in the economic setting with non fungible tokens and all of that, but what are we talking about with informational fungibility?
258850	264266	A	0.8087234497070312	I think it basically comes down to whether you can replicate.
264298	267490	A	0.8458271026611328	I mean, it's basically the difference between classical and quantum information.
267560	275460	A	0.7544975876808167	As far as I know, fungible information is everything that you can basically turn into a message of zeros and ones.
279430	284038	A	0.8449872732162476	How you transmit it may be different, the channel, the physical hardware and so on.
284124	291738	A	0.7985333204269409	But at the end of the day, it's something that you can write on a boundary and something that you can transmit at zeros and ones.
291824	299350	A	0.7895978093147278	Whereas quantum information, you literally have to send the hardware, the piece of hardware, the QRF.
299510	301402	A	0.7090261578559875	At least that's how I understand it.
301456	311114	A	0.8282399773597717	So a simple answer might be that it's information encoded in a piece of software versus a piece of hardware.
311162	314000	A	0.5917598009109497	But I don't think that analogy is perfect.
315750	316114	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
316152	317300	B	0.8420385718345642	Dean, what do you think?
318710	320754	C	0.8213968873023987	Here's what I'm curious about.
320952	323602	C	0.7489878535270691	And again, you guys can help me with this.
323736	330126	C	0.8508224487304688	As opposed to reference frames, I oftentimes default to frame of reference.
330158	337794	C	0.7593705058097839	And I know that in one of the live streams, what I tried to bring out was the idea that there was an ice cream cone looking at an ice cream truck.
337922	346262	C	0.8131160140037537	And the question was always whether or not which one of those two entities, one is in the foreground and one is in the background.
346326	369150	C	0.8653810024261475	And in this slide that Ander has up the question is, is the non fungibility because only A and B can decide whether the VA as seen by B, the A is deeper into that image based on our frame of reference.
369230	376878	C	0.8771554827690125	And the B is closer or is the B the one that's actually deeper and the A is the one that's in the foreground?
376974	392060	C	0.678594172000885	And I was wondering whether the idea of non copyability is because of that depth of field aspect that cannot be determined unless it's literally handed over the way that Chris was describing it.
392830	411840	A	0.6942013502120972	I think that's basically think I'm not sure that I can answer your question, but I think I have the feeling that Chris well, Chris said this in the lecture, that at the end of the day, the KrF is somewhere in your nervous system.
413090	416858	A	0.6938220858573914	And here whether you bring up a good point.
416884	417170	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
417240	421070	A	0.638270914554596	It looks like this slide is a bit of an optical illusion.
421150	427800	A	0.8264124393463135	Whether you see A or B deeper, I guess it depends on something going on inside your head.
429050	434310	A	0.7690622210502625	This picture is so symmetrical that if you focus enough on it, you can change your opinion.
436250	440010	B	0.8698605298995972	Just to even connect that to what we're talking about.
440080	453306	B	0.8372164964675903	The classical fungible information on the Holographic screen, on the blanket, and then the quantum cognitive rotation is those two images are on the screen identical.
453498	472094	B	0.8738093972206116	And then whether it gets a quantum rotation such that the three points of the axes are closer to us than the intersection on that kind of tetrahedron or the other way around, whether the ballerina is rotating one way or the other, that's not on the boundary.
472222	483190	B	0.7936707735061646	So the information about the depth of field is part of the QRF or part of the enactment of the QRF, and it's not written on the boundary.
486200	490100	C	0.8000600337982178	And that goes back to the preparation question and not just the measuring.
490680	491140	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
491210	516110	B	0.8474782705307007	Like if the preparation if your whole enculturation or the last five minutes it was entrained, or you were holding an object, that predisposed you to think that the vertex of the intersection was further away, that's the preparation sets your prior so that when you get this ambiguous artifact, you rotate it into the most natural position.
516740	518080	B	0.7379721999168396	Cognitively.
518500	520844	B	0.8131199479103088	And that's the preparation that sets you up for a measurement.
520892	523200	B	0.7485135197639465	No measurement can happen without a preparation.
524180	525520	B	0.8907124400138855	What do you think, Andrew?
527220	527970	A	0.4753468334674835	Sure.
528840	529204	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
529242	530630	A	0.7202214598655701	Everything you said makes sense.
532680	550570	A	0.8842957615852356	So perhaps let me recall what was that around the slides in this whole spirit or philosophy of making, emphasizing that information is physical, it concubine this whole thing.
551580	578800	A	0.5183526873588562	One of the glaring omissions in physics was the embodiment of the reference frame, which was treated as an abstraction in classical physics, such as by Galileo, but maybe even Einstein, even if he my hunch, is that he did have more of this instinct know, particularly in all those thought experiments of trying to chase the library.
579300	580732	A	0.5948954224586487	You are chasing the library.
580796	580976	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
580998	590740	A	0.8413692712783813	So at the end of the I mean, this is the whole process of making the observer and the reference frame more and more explicit and more and more physical.
591180	593850	A	0.6742563247680664	Because at the end of the day, it has to right.
594460	616990	A	0.7928358912467957	If you start with this assumption, that solipsistic assumption almost, that all you see is part of the same material ether that you are, then you are part of the universe and you're observing something that is out there.
617520	622224	A	0.885179340839386	So you need to include a theory of what it means for you to be observing that.
622262	622608	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
622694	625724	A	0.7899916768074036	And at the end of the day, the observer has to be physical.
625852	630256	A	0.8655684590339661	That's what was emphasized by Chris at the beginning of this lecture.
630448	650456	A	0.8474009037017822	So this jump from treating the reference frame as an abstraction to a real physical entity, these people have talked a lot about in these papers that are quoted there.
650558	657624	A	0.7607485055923462	But I should also remark, if folks want to see this, it's coming up in high energy theory.
657672	666856	A	0.7373934388160706	Also in recent work of Saskind and others, where they talk about quantum reference frames very explicitly.
666968	681940	A	0.6506592035293579	So I don't have the citations off the button, but it's definitely becoming an important thing in the last 20 years, this attempt to really explicitly treat the reference frame and the observer as a quantum entity, as a physical entity.
682680	694330	A	0.825136125087738	Okay, so that's what I just said the jump from treating things reference rims as abstractions to physical objects go.
696620	708940	A	0.5452956557273865	And because we cannot make a perfect copy of quantum information, we say that these are unique and clonable and unfungible.
710000	719184	A	0.8350136280059814	So in order to recreate an experiment perfectly, this is addressed as a part of fungibility or not.
719222	719664	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
719782	734150	A	0.8157458305358887	Can Alice, if you have some sort of quantum experiment and Alice and, you know, it's the usual DPR thought experiment or whatever, alice and Bob are separated by light years.
735000	743850	A	0.76667720079422	Is it enough, if they want to recreate the same, exact same experiment for Alice to send string of zeros and ones?
744460	751176	A	0.7955950498580933	Well, if you had an experiment where that's enough, then you can recreate it with fungible information.
751278	758860	A	0.6615408658981323	If not, then you need to somehow send non fungible information, which really implies sending a piece of hardware.
763710	769150	B	0.9215719699859619	Can I add another piece here on the previous slide?
769570	777562	B	0.5253299474716187	So this looks really technical and scientific, but let's think about Alice's laboratory.
777706	782266	B	0.8833348751068115	Is Alice's brain, mind and Bob's analogously?
782378	786370	B	0.8408133387565613	Alice is thinking about what to say and then says it.
786520	790402	B	0.8765703439712524	And that information might be written in a chat form.
790456	795350	B	0.8989591002464294	It might be said verbally, it might be transmitted through digital or analog signal.
795770	799986	B	0.8679901957511902	But at some point it's going through this classical informational interface.
800018	804182	B	0.7518462538719177	And then Bob's laboratory is like perceiving and unpacking it.
804316	817334	B	0.8745772838592529	And the question of semantic alignment is such that if Alice gives a shopping list of ten items, if there's semantic alignment, bob would be able to go to the store and then find those ten items.
817462	822558	B	0.7689096927642822	And it made me think of the dictionary definition of left and right.
822644	829390	B	0.9139488339424133	So this gets back to our discussion of whether the vertex on these axes is coming towards us or away from us.
829460	842158	B	0.9067926406860352	So I looked up the dictionary definition of left on towards or relating to the side of a human body or of a thing that is to the west when the person or that thing is facing north.
842334	846630	B	0.7912232875823975	So that's, I guess, one attempt to anchor what it means to be left.
846700	850194	B	0.8589969873428345	The second definition is the left hand part side or direction.
850242	853270	B	0.8404354453086853	And you could imagine there's an analogous definition for right.
853420	866890	B	0.6674485206604004	The point is you can't describe verbally leftness and rightness or chirality in general because its reference is an embodied perspective.
867390	883010	B	0.857215940952301	And so if Alice said, okay, you're going to go down the street and then turn left at the stop sign, how would Alice communicate to Bob what leftness meant at that stop sign versus rightness?
884470	887250	B	0.7638108134269714	And that's this question of flipping.
887670	909658	B	0.8276076316833496	And the way that the quantum formalism accommodates that is through the WIC rotation and the quantum cognitive event where the fungible transmittable holographic information gets rotated into the imaginary axis with the formalisms that enable it to be rotated at all.
909744	913500	B	0.8817692995071411	But that means you could rotate it left quote or rotate it right.
915790	919962	A	0.9296944737434387	Yeah, I think that's a very good explanation.
920106	921854	A	0.5760665535926819	I don't know if I have much to add.
921892	923440	A	0.6667847037315369	Dean you wanted to say.
927490	928074	C	0.8068572282791138	Can'T.
928122	957830	C	0.8417086601257324	I don't know the answer to this, but to take what Daniel just said, to take the basic concept of being able to take something that, for all intents and purposes, can appear one way or another and then turn that into how Chris closed the last lecture with we are seeing ourselves as both being entangled and also being separatable.
957990	969834	C	0.6689632534980774	How did we go literally from a three dimension vertex to we're both entangled and we're not living in a paradox.
969962	971742	C	0.6695421934127808	That's just the way it is.
971876	978174	C	0.7097975611686707	We're also removing ourselves or separating ourselves at the same time.
978292	988530	C	0.7011449933052063	That's what I would like to know, because somewhere between three arbitrary lines and complexity is not a paradox.
988870	994760	C	0.5874229669570923	Something has to be happening, and I'm not exactly sure how that transition plays out.
999120	1001230	C	0.8997742533683777	Anybody want to enlighten me?
1001840	1004172	A	0.8431419134140015	Can you repeat your question, please?
1004226	1017170	C	0.6665188670158386	Well, how do we go at this point of the reference frame description of saying, you can't copy it, all you can do is pass it?
1018740	1028180	C	0.8596111536026001	Because we think things could be flipped based on internal reference frames, internal meanings and internal models.
1028520	1030064	C	0.7854491472244263	The thing we choose for context.
1030112	1062908	C	0.7961547374725342	Yada yada yada yada goes all the way out to the conclusion of Chris's conversation with us in number three, where he said, bottom line is that it's not a paradox that as things become more and more complex, then it wants to get to a place of entanglement, alignment, a sense of agreement, and at the same time wants to remain separate.
1063004	1067890	C	0.6659412980079651	So between those two things, a whole lot has happened.
1068900	1076384	C	0.5619499087333679	And I don't think we've skipped over it, but we certainly haven't opened it up and really looked at it closely.
1076432	1080820	C	0.8365880250930786	And I'm just curious what's in between those two scales.
1081160	1081812	A	0.6408694982528687	I agree.
1081866	1088536	A	0.7009986042976379	I think we're going to cover that towards the end of the talk, but I agree.
1088718	1107356	A	0.6751178503036499	I don't know how you see this related to QRS or the stuff we just talked about, but I think it's the big question in this lecture, right, that was like, where does this tension between increasing complexity and wanting to predict what the environment is doing?
1107458	1121296	A	0.7341228723526001	One requires entanglement and the other one requires separability, at least colloquially speaking, I think this tension is basically what the free energy principle comes down to.
1121318	1121456	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
1121478	1122770	A	0.8484231233596802	Daniel, what do you think?
1123300	1127060	A	0.7172320485115051	You have the free energy and you have the E minus TS.
1127560	1128864	A	0.5955417156219482	One is prediction error.
1128912	1130816	A	0.7946015000343323	I mean, not exactly E minus TS.
1130848	1130996	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
1131018	1133456	A	0.7571403980255127	That would be thermodynamics but you know what I mean.
1133498	1138250	A	0.5147478580474854	One is prediction error and the other one is what was?
1139340	1140650	A	0.6910224556922913	I can remember.
1142940	1152604	B	0.807599663734436	I'll definitely look forward to the technical unpacking that you'll get to soon, but I was reminded of the William Blake quotation, do what you will.
1152722	1156376	B	0.8565089106559753	This life's a fiction and is made up of contradiction.
1156568	1165600	B	0.8113726377487183	So let's modify that project what you will, rotate what you will, spacetime's a fiction.
1166020	1177232	B	0.618437647819519	Not that it's false, but that it's a projected fictionalization that it doesn't have the ontological primacy that the topology of communication does and is made up of contradiction.
1177376	1177780	B	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
1177850	1193112	B	0.7564452290534973	And it's made up of this tension between fitting and not overfitting, between aligning and the principle of unitarity and differentiating and becoming through others.
1193166	1205980	B	0.708938479423523	We become ourselves and that type of articulation and recognizing that two complementary forces like convex and concave come into existence at once.
1206050	1213440	B	0.693248987197876	Like a zero to two jump is not an issue or a stumbling block.
1214020	1217170	B	0.7030938267707825	It's that we wouldn't have it any other way.
1218340	1220210	B	0.6400548815727234	Couldn't have it any other way.
1220820	1224016	A	0.5394973158836365	Yeah, sure, we'll get that.
1224038	1227584	A	0.7782760858535767	Towards the end, you can almost even call it a duality.
1227632	1229728	A	0.5030718445777893	It's not far fetched.
1229744	1233788	A	0.5944699048995972	I mean, it's the sort of thing that I think most people will be happy to take for granted.
1233824	1241912	A	0.7177705764770508	Such supersymmetry like you have two kinds of particles, but the same amount of them, and dualities that are all over the place.
1241966	1256600	A	0.7135871648788452	So I think it's not unreasonable to just accept that there is a tension between increasing complexity, which you want A and B to be separable for, and accuracy prediction.
1256680	1268556	A	0.5039575099945068	Now, how this is related to emergent space and these QRS stuff, I don't want to make very far fetched claims.
1268588	1271190	A	0.7807459831237793	We'll talk about emergent space later on the course.
1272200	1279190	A	0.8668942451477051	But for now, let's say a few more words about QRFs and then we'll get to the complexity stuff towards the end.
1282120	1302684	A	0.5435320734977722	QRFs are almost building blocks, if you want, for information processing here, it's very useful to recall definition that I feel I think we have mentioned before of information as being differences that make a difference.
1302882	1307772	A	0.9207045435905457	That's probably the best colloquial definition of information I've heard.
1307826	1310224	A	0.7085339426994324	And I think it does a lot of work.
1310262	1315216	A	0.8130612373352051	I mean, it's almost mathematical, but anyways, we need to unpack it a little more and see.
1315318	1321424	A	0.8392088413238525	So for a difference to make a difference, what do you want out of QRF?
1321472	1322070	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
1322680	1328470	A	0.6311916708946228	Unsurprisingly, I mean, not surprisingly, but reassuringly, I think would be the word.
1330120	1340168	A	0.8391432762145996	You need a QRF to have sensory action and a default state, right?
1340254	1346336	A	0.8745679259300232	This is sort of like where your Bayesian prior distribution is encoded.
1346468	1352312	A	0.5874499082565308	These three things will give you a building block for any information processing.
1352456	1364240	A	0.8802534937858582	And that ties together with all the work in the free energy literature and perception action loops and whatnot.
1365140	1373216	A	0.8151124119758606	So before we see mathematically how a TRF is defined, I think it's more illustrative.
1373248	1383444	A	0.7018380761146545	And I think Chris went exactly on the right order when he presented this a couple weeks ago, seeing examples from h.
1383642	1391960	A	0.8309095501899719	These are actual pieces of hardware that are effectively QRX, and it's remarkable how they map to well.
1392030	1393672	A	0.8190985918045044	I'll skip ahead a little bit.
1393726	1409256	A	0.8835492134094238	But when you get to the mathematical definition of a QRF as a quantum system that you can specify with this category theory diagram, you have incoming arrows into a node that then expands.
1409288	1409484	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
1409522	1418684	A	0.8732572793960571	And this roughly corresponds to measurement and preparation degrees of not degrees of freedom, degrees of freedom would be the same, right, when you attach it to the boundary.
1418812	1422870	A	0.6683129668235779	But measurement and preparation stages, I guess, would be the better word.
1424600	1428500	A	0.8105247616767883	But anyways, let me go back to these examples, right?
1428650	1433448	A	0.6406876444816589	And Daniel, you're the biologist here, so correct me if I say anything wrong here.
1433534	1443144	A	0.709882378578186	You have a cartoon picture of a bacteria, I think, and this is a very simple sort of thing, right?
1443182	1449790	A	0.9001404643058777	It navigates in the direction of food and that's it, right?
1450240	1454600	A	0.7186467051506042	So it is a very simple rudimentary example of a cureb.
1454760	1463324	A	0.8567469120025635	You have the sensory stage here, I guess the degrees of freedom.
1463372	1465040	A	0.793317973613739	I guess the degrees of freedom.
1466260	1469490	A	0.7039888501167297	It's not obvious here what the boundary is, that's one thing.
1470420	1481716	A	0.5261074900627136	But it is a good enough picture to see the resemblance to here we have the measurement which in this case you're trying to measure concentration of food.
1481898	1492490	A	0.9082401990890503	You have your node here, C, which is your prior distribution for concentration of food.
1492860	1504604	A	0.8316892981529236	And finally you have the output, the preparation stage, which is the rest of this chemical network that will control and steer this bacteria, right?
1504642	1513730	A	0.8415560722351074	So there is here you want to call it the action degrees of freedom that will steer this bacteria in the direction of food.
1514180	1519840	A	0.49326518177986145	And likewise with cell division, this I understand even less that the network appears more complicated.
1520840	1536920	A	0.675433337688446	But I think it's fair to say that at the end of the day, all these chemical networks that appear super complicated somehow have to be mapped to this category theoretical diagram.
1537580	1539048	A	0.6715730428695679	That's all there is to it.
1539134	1552750	A	0.8441081047058105	You're going to have the sensory input and the action output and you're going to have the default chemical concentration which amounts to this node over here.
1556320	1559304	A	0.8960029482841492	You remember this from last lecture, right, Daniel?
1559432	1559868	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1559954	1566796	B	0.8915948867797852	And the Cone Co cone we explored also in live stream 17 on the Bayesian semantic information flow.
1566908	1580352	B	0.8902884125709534	But I'll kind of add a point about these biological systems in relationship to artificially specified systems and what that helps us understand about perception, cognition, action.
1580496	1599272	B	0.9012207984924316	So the cone COCONE diagram has this bow tie architecture or this kind of like two pyramids touching point to point where there's a preparation and a measurement which can be different dimensionalities or different scopes.
1599416	1605388	B	0.8435779213905334	Like it could be multi input, multi output or multi input, single output, vice versa and so on.
1605554	1611760	B	0.8736287951469421	But they come through this eye of the needle with C prime here.
1611910	1623350	B	0.821569561958313	Now, contrast that kind of architecture represented here abstractly, with what we see in the bacterial process and in the cell division process.
1623720	1636680	B	0.861496090888977	These have that kind of a bow tie perception, cognition, action architecture or measurement, cognitive integration, preparation architecture.
1637580	1661516	B	0.6494672298431396	In contrast, we see, for example, an artificial neural network where the input and the output layers are usually lower dimensional, maybe an image coming in with several hundred pixels and a single output like a classifier coming out the other end, but a dimensional explosion in those internal cognitive layers.
1661708	1664204	B	0.6766875982284546	But in biological systems.
1664332	1666476	B	0.6408715844154358	It's actually exactly the opposite.
1666588	1674564	B	0.8470668196678162	For example, many, many receptors on the cell surface, on the holographic boundary, the sensorium of the cell.
1674762	1682580	B	0.8517720699310303	But then there are these common secondary messengers that many pathways converge upon.
1683100	1713040	B	0.8157382607460022	So that reflects the kind of radically different architecture that a QRF embodies, as opposed to the approach taken by disembodied intelligence frameworks which use dimensional explosion internally to try to categorize and classify and find edge cases versus this dimensional winnowing that is reflective of these embodied intelligences.
1715620	1733624	A	0.9135238528251648	And if I may make a tangential comment here also, I think the good thing about these two examples is that they also showcase the fact of how the deep implications of scale free biology, if you want to call it this way.
1733662	1746596	A	0.7936488389968872	We tend to think of these sorts of processes such as here only happening at the level of the nervous system in animals, or as you said, neural networks.
1746628	1746872	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
1746926	1749420	A	0.836707592010498	We tend to associate this with neural networks.
1749920	1756988	A	0.8307567834854126	And perhaps evolution has tiered us in a way that endowed us with nervous systems to make these things.
1757074	1764720	A	0.7622093558311462	Maybe these are higher up in the layers, but really that's a bit of an arbitrary distinction that we make.
1764870	1771350	A	0.8141196966171265	The processes going on at the cellular level, even if they don't appear to have anything to do with nervous system.
1772280	1792360	A	0.7877832651138306	My understanding is that there are some generic properties that are the same and everything that has to do with information processing, it manifests maybe slightly different when it comes to explicit neurons, but at the end of the day, it's the same generic process going on.
1792430	1792936	A	0.7943934202194214	Would you say?
1792958	1794360	A	0.8432830572128296	That's right, Daniel?
1796880	1808540	B	0.7991732358932495	The ontological claim is that it's the same generic process happening, whereas the more instrumentalist claim is that we can model it with some shared abstractions.
1811460	1812064	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1812182	1814128	A	0.6756085157394409	Okay, so we can continue.
1814214	1814850	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
1816500	1824004	A	0.5916098952293396	So from, you know, I don't have a whole lot to say.
1824042	1840760	A	0.7952977418899536	Daniel said quite a bit about at the end of the day, QRF, you can visualize it as this diagram and you can think of it as if you are more familiar with the picture of a neural network and ways on a neural network and so on.
1840910	1843210	A	0.6825336217880249	That's the way to think about it.
1844380	1848776	A	0.8261837363243103	Now, let's continue with explicit embodiment, if you wish.
1848968	1858460	A	0.8864966034889221	So QRFs in the formalism have to be attached to a boundary boundary degrees of freedom.
1858540	1874820	A	0.6190557479858398	And I should add another remark here, and personally to me also, the hard part about this quantum free energy principle, formalism, if you wish, is what you said at the beginning is the fact that it's topological, right?
1874890	1878196	A	0.5250860452651978	So very often it's not clear what the boundary degrees of freedom are.
1878378	1878772	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
1878826	1888520	A	0.8180176019668579	Because we tend to think of boundaries as geometrical and certainly the classical FEP treats them as geometrical.
1889340	1899180	A	0.7510175108909607	But that's not the case here in the quantum free energy formalism where we have emergent space will be talked about in later sessions.
1899760	1916400	A	0.6693654656410217	But that's just like one quick remark to make at the end of the day, though, even if it's topological, we're going to have real degrees of freedom that this URF is attaching to this cone cocoon diagram.
1916740	1925670	A	0.8775142431259155	And you're going to have measurement operators that yield classical outcomes plus and minus one.
1929160	1946780	A	0.8829993605613708	And then you can think of this QRF or more abstractly, this concoction diagram as a neural network, if it was acting on those Ander qubits and then back propagating some sort of action signal preparation.
1949360	1964000	A	0.8213638663291931	Okay, let's not forget that Lambdawer's principle and so on requires that we are mindful of energy constraints on computation.
1964660	1968320	A	0.6969259977340698	And that gives us the following picture.
1971960	1983868	A	0.747382402420044	Number one, we're going to have to use energy from the environment to fuel our computation, to fuel our observation.
1984064	1990090	A	0.6673086881637573	That means that right away you cannot use the entirety of your boundary to gather information.
1991180	1996192	A	0.7639815807342529	It necessitates an allocation of resources.
1996276	2013376	A	0.824296772480011	Right here, E is the observed environment, and the blue portion is A, thermodynamical sector where you extract free energy and dump heat in order to run this computational process.
2013558	2021220	A	0.592619776725769	And then furthermore, you can have a memory sector where you write things on a boundary, and this takes up energy.
2021290	2026150	A	0.8583777546882629	Also, writing information onto the boundary by Landauer's Principle will take up information.
2027720	2046540	A	0.7234235405921936	And Chris called this the minimal interesting observer because it has a memory sector, and quite minimal here implies that we have at least minimal interesting implies that we have more than one layer here.
2046610	2057820	A	0.8965578675270081	The process of writing things into a memory sector requires us to have a clock so that we can label those memories in time.
2057890	2062290	A	0.8345712423324585	Okay, so we do have time as part of this formalism, just not space yet.
2063060	2066960	A	0.7743573188781738	Time has to be internal to the observer.
2068020	2072470	B	0.9110074639320374	Just one piece on that that Chris mentioned.
2074040	2091370	B	0.8505411148071289	And as you echoed, time here is an attribute of some cognitive systems in terms of their internal understanding so that they can sort memories and understand what came earlier or later.
2091900	2099516	B	0.7467660903930664	It's not something that's a priori defined externally, which is the case in the kind of spacetime first.
2099618	2102350	B	0.8279502987861633	Now, how do we fit communication into here?
2102960	2113996	B	0.8788806200027466	We flip that we're talking about the topology of communication as ontologically, primal and now certain kinds of sophisticated agents.
2114098	2127940	B	0.8145402073860168	This is not like necessarily true of a rock or a metronome or a particle of a gas, but some kinds of cognitive systems are such that they are able to generate an internal clock concept.
2128360	2133244	B	0.6293657422065735	And that doesn't have to be the same thing as what's happening on the wall with Kronos.
2133312	2140356	B	0.8544225692749023	This can reflect a purely internal time kairos that enables observers or interactors that have different clock structures.
2140468	2150072	B	0.838616669178009	And then Landauer's principle helps us arbitrage or connect the informational demands to the energetic or the metabolic demands.
2150136	2168560	C	0.8063311576843262	Dean so when I first listened to the lecture, I thought when the term or phrase trade off was raised, I traditionally have thought of trade off as kind of a binary.
2168980	2175956	C	0.5080713629722595	If I'm picking this, I'm trading off against all the other things that I didn't pick.
2176138	2180240	C	0.8570587038993835	So one or the other or others plural.
2180400	2194948	C	0.8062772154808044	But when I saw this, and especially when I heard it in the context of things like degrees of freedom, I began to wonder whether it is because it could sit on either side of that boundary.
2194964	2210624	C	0.8008323907852173	It could be a priori or it could be ad hoc or post hoc, a trade off which prior to this conversation, I just assumed that a trade off was one or the other.
2210822	2214450	C	0.6888002753257751	But essentially what this implies is.
2216740	2217196	A	0.6453943848609924	It'S.
2217228	2230036	C	0.871087372303009	Still a kind of a degree of how much weight you put into it and then you kind of cross a threshold and then you've made your pick, you've completed your trade off.
2230138	2236084	C	0.5716773271560669	Or again, did I misinterpret what I was hearing?
2236212	2252030	C	0.8095107078552246	If it's topological as opposed to the more conventional spacetime perspective, can a trade off be both ad hoc and post hoc, seemingly at the same time?
2257700	2259410	B	0.8428775072097778	Very interesting question.
2260100	2263670	B	0.7012273669242859	Let us just let it float and continue on enter.
2264120	2265076	C	0.4896698594093323	All right.
2265258	2269270	C	0.7797115445137024	Because again, I'll just say this.
2269720	2284170	C	0.6411901712417603	If it can be, that would really move us out of the classical realm that would essentially say that anytime we've made a pick, we really haven't made a pick.
2284620	2297592	C	0.7642637491226196	There's still a whole bunch of other things that are going to happen that can change whatever that action is that we thought we carried out or enacted.
2297736	2309680	C	0.7718987464904785	If we're talking about an internal, internality state, which is what I think we want, I think we want to be able to change our minds.
2312920	2314772	B	0.7883089184761047	Let me take that one way.
2314906	2315700	B	0.6498749256134033	Dean.
2317000	2347176	B	0.7132061123847961	The analytical equations of the Action perception loop don't tell us in implementation like if we're going to write it in code, whether we should use Action first procedurally to update our observations, or whether we enable our observations to wag the dog and then select Action at the end of the loop.
2347208	2350892	B	0.8398213982582092	So is it a perception action loop or is it an action perception loop?
2351036	2374720	B	0.8538414239883423	And those enable a kind of seesaw where sometimes we want what we learn to change what we do and other times we want what we do to change what we learn and having that kind of a fulcrum or a pivot and again to connect it to the vertex popping in and out.
2374890	2383560	B	0.5434682965278625	The analytical formalisms inscribed on the screen of the FEP, like the textbooks, they're ambiguous.
2384060	2418704	B	0.7248252034187317	Whether we lead with action and have inference follow or whether we lead with inference and have action follow or lead with action have inference follow whichever one of the combinations there are, and then that trade off or runoff is broken by specific embodied cognitive agents that trade off about the procedural primacy of perception or action can't be broken.
2418832	2420950	B	0.7986040711402893	Generically, right?
2425580	2426360	A	0.5746495127677917	MMM.
2429630	2432650	C	0.7970457077026367	It certainly makes for a lot of waste heat if you're not careful.
2436790	2439220	C	0.7526342272758484	It'd be exhausting a lot anyway.
2442090	2442840	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
2446890	2454342	A	0.6188648343086243	I don't know if we can talk about intent much with this formalism, but.
2454396	2466060	A	0.7108538150787354	We can take a very descriptive approach to it and go down here a little more actually before I don't want to get ahead of myself.
2466430	2493300	A	0.740054190158844	What I mean by that is whether we can put intent or not in this hierarchy, I don't know if it matters a whole lot, but at least we can talk about it operationally and descriptively and say just like when you have a clock, the clock is just there, right?
2494890	2498086	A	0.5995135307312012	If you don't have the clock, you don't have the memory and that's it, right?
2498268	2512540	A	0.6468535661697388	And likewise here, if we don't have an attention control compartment, we cannot play with all these QRFs that are non commutative at the same time.
2512910	2521514	A	0.6842149496078491	So if there is no attention control system to begin with, we cannot talk about a system that has non commutative cure apps.
2521562	2527120	A	0.85328209400177	Meaning here, one presumably goes to memory sectors, the other one goes to environment sectors and so on.
2531930	2548650	A	0.8099676966667175	So this is certainly a necessity of the fact that we have different sectors of the boundary being allocated to different purposes, such as environmental observation and memory and so on, within the environment.
2550190	2564622	A	0.8181958794593811	It's worth remarking that here, if you think deeply about first principles and what it means to observe an entity, well, you still come down to these differences that make a difference sort of thing.
2564676	2565182	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2565316	2578494	A	0.8357019424438477	Which involves whenever you're looking at the environment, if you're going to identify a system, you need sort of a background that tells you that puts the system in context.
2578542	2578802	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2578856	2581994	A	0.8590282201766968	So that you can identify the system as something distinct.
2582142	2611534	A	0.5919009447097778	I think this, again, is something that we have talked about in previous discussions where the easiest picture here is something like the speed gauge in your car, where P is the gauge itself that tells you the speed, but it's meaningless without the reference system right, outside of the thing that stays invariant, right?
2611652	2617070	A	0.5126633048057556	The context, the background that gauge moving means nothing to you.
2617220	2633510	A	0.871339738368988	So we come back to this idea of if we think of information as differences that make a difference in terms of first principles, this environment sector that we saw earlier has to be further broken down into pointer and reference estates.
2634490	2639762	A	0.8396314978599548	Again, this is covered in depth in Chris's papers.
2639906	2644790	A	0.7287325263023376	I'm thinking particularly of free energy for generating quantum systems.
2646990	2665390	A	0.8100603222846985	And again, just to reiterate this attention control staff compartment, which is, by the way, very reminiscent to the hierarchy that was earlier, with the clock arising higher up in the hierarchy, deeper into the layer.
2666770	2672298	A	0.8349743485450745	Likewise, whenever you're writing something into MMR, you need to have that clock.
2672394	2680174	A	0.641921877861023	Whenever you are deploying noncommunicated gear apps, you're going to need an attention control compartment.
2680302	2682950	A	0.8096269369125366	And we just described this operationally.
2683690	2691030	A	0.6355385184288025	If you didn't have it, then the agent would not be what it is, could not deploy those noncommutative QRFs.
2692810	2702460	A	0.8059186339378357	So, marching on, we'll just end here with QRF alignment and the free energy principle.
2702620	2704304	A	0.7472910284996033	Just a few more words.
2704502	2728516	A	0.9699519276618958	This is possibly the most interesting picture in this presentation and just we can recall here the possibilities for KrF alignment and how free energy comes into play in this formalism we call a the trivial interaction.
2728548	2731240	A	0.8749346137046814	We call this a thermal interaction.
2732640	2734604	A	0.7226579785346985	And then you have a bunch of possibilities, right?
2734642	2746160	A	0.8163818717002869	And depending on each possibility, you're going to see things as noise or as in the paper says, non local hidden variables.
2747540	2757040	A	0.5611236095428467	The last situation is what we call alignment when we have QRFs of the same size, perfectly aligned.
2760120	2772806	A	0.7192612886428833	Recall, I think this would be the situation where you have noiseless classical computation, right?
2772908	2775270	A	0.8482299447059631	You have A and B just interacting.
2777210	2788582	A	0.7313701510429382	And also this is the situation where, correct me if I'm wrong, Daniel, this is Entanglements, right?
2788636	2799130	A	0.8514082431793213	Asymptotically once all the curves are aligned, you have entanglement and now we can tie it back maybe to Dean's earlier.
2799290	2804560	A	0.8920873999595642	So these two slides conclude the discussion basically and then we can open it up.
2805570	2826230	A	0.9035736322402954	So given these possibilities for how QRFs can be aligned, QRFs deployed by AMD can be aligned, and how in each situation you're going to get noise or whatever, then what does the free energy principle say in this quantum setting?
2827210	2827960	C	0.6177208423614502	Well.
2830330	2834230	A	0.7796734571456909	Minimizing variational, free energy leads you to entanglements.
2835630	2848170	A	0.7763689160346985	So if theorem here, if you are in the picture of B here and the QRFs are aligned, a and B are going to be intact.
2852340	2870400	A	0.8664470911026001	Now, there is a tension between this tendency towards alignment as free energy principle will carry you and observe reality, which is that we're not just a Blob of Entangled particles.
2870480	2885850	A	0.8015462756156921	There is separability and systems are attention between maintaining separability and at the same time being correlated enough to the environment so as to be able to predict it.
2887200	2892700	A	0.5931905508041382	And now we can maybe go into a more philosophical discussion about the free energy principle.
2893200	2912820	A	0.5366841554641724	I should also say in the last month, just like I talked earlier, TRFs Lenny Suskin, whose recent paper that talks about TRF led me into a rabbit hole of looking into his recent work and he's talked a lot about complexity.
2913560	2921872	A	0.5479987263679504	I'm being very speculative here, so if someone can call me out, that would be good in the comments.
2922016	2937608	A	0.8013976216316223	But just skimming through some of his papers, I saw a monograph in 2018 where he talks about complexity and he puts forward this second law for complexity in quantum systems and increased complexity.
2937784	2940732	A	0.6072194576263428	And it is very reminiscent of what's going on here.
2940786	2960960	A	0.7193893194198608	You have a tension between systems tending to entanglement and the other side of the free energy functional, if you wish, where systems increase in complexity and that necessarily requires that A and B are separate.
2961640	2964550	A	0.8877695202827454	So Daniel, do you have any comments at this point?
2966520	2968404	B	0.7740403413772583	Yeah, there's a lot to it.
2968602	2979524	B	0.9759665131568909	I like that you showed the four possibilities in the image above and said it was one of the most interesting figures.
2979652	2982330	B	0.6408694982528687	I agree.
2982940	3012560	B	0.8850793838500977	And how to connect this to the classical FEP and also how to see the quantum FEP not as just a second story built on top of the classical FEP which would be kind of like a historical chronological understanding of the theoretical apparatus.
3012720	3024012	B	0.7235292196273804	But it's almost like the quantum FEP was like a basement we didn't know about because it gives a broader context.
3024096	3037900	B	0.785929262638092	And though it appeared conceptually several years later in the timeline we understand that doesn't give it a secondary status.
3038800	3063090	B	0.6957945823669434	So what it really means for the classical FEP to be kind of like a special case of this actually more generic setting there's just a lot I'm very.
3066200	3071796	A	0.9094516038894653	I can wrap it up and then if Dean or you want to say something, we can continue with that.
3071818	3084532	A	0.833060622215271	But let me conclude and this is all I have to say for mean, I'm sure Chris will explain this more in coming sessions and lectures.
3084596	3090350	A	0.8005223274230957	But I think the main key differences is in the emergence of space.
3090720	3096300	A	0.9091131687164307	How it might emerge from something more fundamental, maybe a tensor network or who knows?
3096800	3100384	A	0.7611926794052124	But that's the big difference, right?
3100502	3108560	A	0.7352767586708069	And I suppose the quantum free energy principle generalizes the classical free energy principle because it doesn't have this spatial embedding.
3108900	3122052	A	0.6749468445777893	Now, this to me personally and also to folks in the audience for asking questions is probably the hardest part to wrap your head around.
3122186	3131290	A	0.7033275961875916	And I foresee interest in those discussions and lectures that deal with the concept of emergent space.
3132060	3145656	A	0.77579665184021	Because every time you try to and I've done this myself I've been thinking about how you could apply this formalism to better known pictures or compared it, for instance, with thermal equilibrium, with relaxation, with thermal equilibrium.
3145688	3148664	A	0.8179686665534973	And then you start thinking about, okay, what is the boundary and so on.
3148802	3150144	A	0.6911513805389404	It's far from obvious, right?
3150182	3155356	A	0.7581191658973694	Because, again, you have to remind yourself that the definition is topological.
3155548	3168790	A	0.5665918588638306	So in that regard, I think it might be worth talking about one of the questions that came up that I thought was good and then I can call it a day on this end.
3171080	3175156	A	0.899355411529541	So this question and I think it was the first question asked since the.
3175338	3180664	B	0.79533851146698	Last lecture can you just read the full question and then read the full answer?
3180702	3181448	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3181614	3183352	A	0.8286596536636353	The answer, it's number 28 here.
3183406	3184184	A	0.8762708902359009	Can you guys see it?
3184222	3185848	A	0.8960692882537842	Should I zoom in it a little bit?
3186014	3188908	B	0.928453266620636	It's pretty small, but reading it will be good.
3189074	3189452	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
3189506	3197564	A	0.8619978427886963	So this question I think I've asked myself this question too, maybe in a different way.
3197602	3201330	A	0.8144946098327637	But basically it gets to the point of what I was saying earlier, right?
3202500	3216288	A	0.7479168176651001	That it would be nice to see how we can use this quantum free energy principle formalism to recover maybe familiar settings such as relaxation to thermal equilibrium via the heat equation.
3216384	3220550	A	0.5668111443519592	But that's far from obvious how you do it if your definition is topological, right?
3222520	3226840	A	0.8543633222579956	So the question says, what happens when the agent becomes identical to the environment?
3227500	3231252	A	0.5620506405830383	When the model has been improved so much that it does not differ from the environment.
3231316	3232632	A	0.6221144199371338	Is this a state even possible?
3232686	3237060	A	0.9096413850784302	Would it be thermodynamical equilibrium maximum entanglement?
3237220	3257904	A	0.690367579460144	Okay, so clearly it's not thermodynamical equilibrium, but I think what the person is asking if maybe if I'm understanding this correctly, they're wondering, okay, so if the free energy principle drives A and B towards entanglement, then it's fair to say that any distinction between them has dissolved, right?
3257942	3259890	A	0.699889600276947	That they have merged into the same thing.
3262760	3271460	A	0.8727396726608276	That has to do with this whole definition of philosophical debate of thingness that Karl Prieston is a proponent of, right?
3271610	3274380	A	0.7962416410446167	What it means for two things to be separate.
3274560	3277770	A	0.849421501159668	Okay, so let's see what Chris said.
3281260	3288472	A	0.859088122844696	Kristen has pointed out that the limit of the classical FEP, the limit of perfect prediction, corresponds to generalized synchrony between system and environment.
3288536	3292380	A	0.6919745206832886	Each sends messages that the other can perfectly predict.
3293840	3298852	A	0.8109915852546692	Now, however, it's clear I'm not reading anymore.
3298936	3300992	A	0.856739342212677	I'm making a quick remark here.
3301046	3302544	A	0.7802363634109497	I'll continue in a second.
3302742	3317440	A	0.8272174000740051	In the classical FEP, it's clear that A and B, even if they are in the perfect limit of the FEP, they remain different entities.
3317520	3317764	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3317802	3327876	A	0.8693575263023376	Because you have that, if you wish, that extra layers of differentiation coming from their spatial embedding.
3327988	3328600	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3328750	3337812	A	0.7488570213317871	In the classical FEP that is clear that they haven't even if they are getting synchronized, they have not lost their separate identities.
3337876	3342460	A	0.7542949914932251	You can always say, well, this is the one that was to the left and this is the one that was to the right.
3342530	3345070	A	0.8519874811172485	Pun intended with earlier discussion, right?
3346240	3355536	A	0.886314868927002	You have that extra resource for separating them, if you wish, by virtue of the special embedding, right?
3355558	3362880	A	0.6295441389083862	The special embedding is giving you this extra information that allows you to keep track of amb separately.
3363460	3364212	A	0.7528188824653625	So I'll continue.
3364266	3368816	A	0.8328189253807068	This notion depends on the system and its environment being separated and hence distinguished somehow.
3369008	3373556	A	0.8531996607780457	In classical formulations, they are separated in ordinary 3D space, I e.
3373578	3375500	A	0.7882568836212158	They occupy different locations.
3375600	3377940	A	0.8023397326469421	So they are different because they occupy different locations.
3378020	3378360	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
3378430	3383832	A	0.7216417193412781	But if you don't have that geometrical background, then how you know that they're different, right?
3383966	3385864	A	0.7156820297241211	Okay, so I continue.
3386062	3390232	A	0.7846803665161133	The quantum formulation is background free, meaning it assumes no spacetime embedding.
3390296	3396830	A	0.8168249130249023	System and environment do not have different locations, even though they have different sets of degrees of freedom in the overall Hilbert space.
3398160	3399660	A	0.7242177724838257	Here the FPP.
3400240	3403120	A	0.6966326236724854	The limit of the FEP is maximum entanglement.
3403460	3406252	A	0.5859478116035461	This does not mean that the system and its environment are identical.
3406316	3406656	A	0.5817788243293762	They are.
3406678	3408700	A	0.799240231513977	And they have different degrees of freedom.
3408780	3413452	A	0.8412429690361023	Okay, so this is just addresses the question I just posed.
3413596	3421860	A	0.6245115399360657	It means that the joint state is not separable into a system S and environment e.
3422010	3424684	A	0.5004844665527344	Their states are no longer conditionally independent.
3424832	3437160	A	0.8700413703918457	This is distinct from thermal equilibrium, which means that they have the same temperature while remaining separable and that their interaction can be characterized as the change of thermal fluctuations I E noise.
3439760	3442876	A	0.9642558097839355	So I guess this is a nice warm up for things that are to come.
3442978	3462790	A	0.919089674949646	But I do think that this whole idea of emergent space is going to be possibly one of the most important in the course, and it's going to help the gap between the class and quantum formulations, for sure.
3464440	3466390	B	0.8527649641036987	Dean, what's your take on this?
3467160	3478600	C	0.648735523223877	What I saw was that when you have that kind of alignment, that perfect alignment, that was one that was D in that diagram, right?
3478670	3490588	C	0.7459253668785095	That was one state of a complex state that included an A and a B and a C and probably a whole bunch of other ways that yeah, right.
3490674	3499012	C	0.6119129657745361	So that one state where you've got this kind of entanglement isn't into perpetuity.
3499096	3501008	C	0.646217942237854	Like you don't get there and then stay there.
3501094	3517540	C	0.7681187987327576	And that's where, I think, the question of separability and complexity, it still works because just because you've momentarily gotten to a place that we define here as D doesn't mean you stay there indefinitely.
3517880	3523140	C	0.8435353636741638	You could be swapping around to B and C and A in the next instant.
3523740	3528730	C	0.685576319694519	So at least that holds the complexity piece up.
3529900	3533544	C	0.682028591632843	That moment for however long that moment is.
3533662	3537420	C	0.8516804575920105	Where X A and X B are aligned isn't permanent.
3537760	3540316	C	0.751945436000824	So it's not predictable in that sense.
3540418	3542460	C	0.7324272394180298	Therefore it is complex.
3543280	3550690	C	0.5390577912330627	I still don't know how we get, though, that the closer we get to agreement, the more complex things are.
3551700	3560940	C	0.8984181880950928	Unless we're just talking about D in this array of ABC and D that goes back to that quantum reference frame.
3561020	3573924	C	0.4945468306541443	I think, like I said, again, maybe I'm interpreting this wrong, but when I message pass the reason why, I have to literally give it over to the other person and let them have it.
3573962	3575844	C	0.5992405414581299	I can't have them copy.
3575892	3597640	C	0.6341752409934998	What I'm doing is because there has to be, I guess that reinforces the separability piece of this as well, the fact that I can't give them a copy, that I can only give them the information, and then they've got to sort of unpack it in their own way of taking it off the boundary.
3597800	3602048	C	0.7991430163383484	But again, I struggle with this.
3602214	3618630	C	0.6546600461006165	I'm guilty as charged, but what I'm trying to do is trying to come up with my own narrative, so that what Chris is saying makes sense to me, as opposed to make sense to the world, which is what Chris is trying to do.
3620440	3623540	B	0.770606517791748	I'll try with another speculative fiction.
3623900	3630712	B	0.8494917750358582	So there's a screen between, let's just say, the stage and the audience or whatever.
3630766	3632392	B	0.7787699699401855	It's a holographic screen.
3632526	3637790	B	0.8262665271759033	And on each side of the screen, there's some embodied object.
3638400	3648072	B	0.7199214100837708	So that means that it's a volume enclosing object because points and lines and planes are only abstractions.
3648136	3650892	B	0.796615719795227	Every real physical object encloses volume.
3651036	3657920	B	0.9045470356941223	And now a light is going to be coming from behind each object facing the screen.
3658070	3662644	B	0.5888027548789978	And that's this kind of cone that we're seeing from each side.
3662682	3665348	B	0.6796316504478455	It's like the shadow cast by the object.
3665514	3673076	B	0.9020112156867981	So if the object was a sphere, then it would be projecting down to a circle onto the screen.
3673258	3677704	B	0.820125937461853	If the shape were a cube, it could be projecting down.
3677742	3688920	B	0.9014995098114014	And so where the light is positioned is the perspective that that cognitive entity is taking on its QRF.
3689420	3690604	B	0.7180348038673401	Those lights could move.
3690642	3693420	B	0.7190248370170593	So now we have the situation where the two spotlights are moving.
3693570	3696748	B	0.8777663707733154	Maybe the shapes are staying the same, maybe they're changing too.
3696914	3717620	B	0.7356350421905518	And it's like two search lights scanning across this B oval and sometimes they are perfectly locked or there could be a situation where they're perfectly aligned or there could be situations where they're totally disjoint.
3719720	3732970	B	0.7852641940116882	And each of those situations have different implications for what one entity sees when it looks at the screen.
3733500	3741404	B	0.5773096084594727	Maybe like the shadow is the only part where you can see because the rest of it is too blinding or something like that.
3741602	3759120	B	0.783859372138977	And so then if we're in case A here where maybe B doesn't have a projection or maybe B's projection is totally somewhere else, then A is in this solipsistic I'm the active agent interacting within an inert world setting.
3760020	3780520	B	0.5259691476821899	And D is like potentially the computer engineer's classical dream or Asymptote, which is like all the data going through the USB cable is just being perfectly noiselessly received.
3781180	3786200	B	0.7374396920204163	And then we also get these B and C cases.
3787020	3790430	B	0.7184731364250183	But A is kind of like the inert world.
3791600	3799096	B	0.7911219596862793	D is like the perfect communication channel and then to connect it just to Friston's concept of generalized synchrony.
3799208	3804204	B	0.7695197463035583	As we've talked about many times, generalized synchrony doesn't mean lockstep.
3804332	3812420	B	0.796520471572876	Two agents could reduce their uncertainty about each other, not by doing the same thing at every time step, but for example by turn taking.
3812570	3831012	B	0.8231877088546753	And I think that points the way to how we get reduction of variational free energy, reduction of prediction error, surprise and so on without especially spatial temporal enmeshment, but not necessarily even informational identity enmeshment.
3831156	3842136	B	0.586371123790741	Because you could have two things that through their alignment become actually differentiated and that could increase the mutual information between two metronomes.
3842248	3847992	B	0.6992934942245483	Not just to have them going in the same direction, but to have them going in opposite directions.
3848136	3851730	B	0.6668915152549744	The mutual information in those two settings is going to be high.
3852100	3863700	B	0.5159029364585876	So it's not the case that generalized synchrony means that things are becoming blurred.
3864920	3876040	B	0.5371720194816589	We could actually also have integrated information through increased articulation, not just decreased.
3876620	3881450	B	0.532040536403656	And then life finds a way or cognition finds a way.
3882060	3895396	B	0.8445505499839783	On this trade off frontier of in our pursuit of unitarity, will we blur to unify or will we differentiate to unify?
3895588	3897896	B	0.7387047410011292	But those are the paths we have.
3898078	3900960	B	0.5428922772407532	We don't have the backwards.
3903700	3906290	C	0.7102569341659546	Yeah, yeah, makes sense.
3913720	3917220	B	0.8663307428359985	Any other latter slides ender?
3917800	3919030	A	0.5205903649330139	No, that's it.
3919480	3932116	A	0.755520224571228	So Chris made a few more remarks at the end about language here, but he mentioned that he's going to talk more about this in the coming lecture.
3932148	3934410	A	0.7957167029380798	So we'll just leave it up to him.
3938650	3939494	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3939692	3961180	B	0.9558029174804688	There could be some very powerful and interesting linguistic opportunities for updating our speaking to reflect what we are learning here.
3962590	4013580	B	0.5713009834289551	I don't know what those necessarily are, whether it's a syntactic or a semantic thing or whether it's a narrative thing, but how to actually reenter some of these formalisms into our focus understanding could just be immensely powerful and we could have a lot of integrity between the natural language way that potentially were already showing up for engagement and some of these formalisms that get to first principles about interacting entities and boundary conditions and all of that.
4015490	4017950	B	0.8593165874481201	Dean, any penultimate thoughts?
4018450	4019454	C	0.5598527193069458	Not really.
4019652	4035806	C	0.8728465437889099	I'm going to go back and listen to the I'm going to listen to Chris's comments again about this common cause and the fine tuning assumption and whether that's sort of metaphorically, a dialing in or what he means exactly by the fine tuning.
4035918	4046790	C	0.8364853262901306	In the context of this conversation today, what you just kind of said about are we dulling something here or are we sculpting something to make it more fittable?
4048010	4056860	C	0.9018322229385376	I'm going to go now and go back and listen to what he talks about in terms of fine tuning and maybe update my priors around that.
4060670	4068160	B	0.9446433782577515	And are there any last thoughts or maybe scroll over to the schedule of the course again just so we can close on that?
4070370	4072718	B	0.7694591283798218	Yeah, we're halfway through.
4072804	4080590	B	0.7888370156288147	We just completed the third discussion section now, so we've had three lectures and three discussions.
4080750	4082900	B	0.8291600346565247	It's all downhill from here.
4083670	4085810	B	0.8640458583831787	By the way, this was the first midterm.
4086470	4088180	B	0.9418342709541321	You guys both did well.
4090150	4106326	B	0.8788677453994751	We're going to head into session four with these last three, how agents use multiple communication channels and that's going to get connected to the quantum FEP, how spacetime emerges from communication, which is something that we've brought up a bunch.
4106438	4110054	B	0.9039473533630371	It's been in the background, but making that explicit is going to be exciting.
4110102	4124750	B	0.5423039793968201	And then section six, I think, is just going to be such a jumping off point because the scope and the intensity of what is transpiring is extreme.
4125090	4137346	B	0.9752802848815918	So connecting it to biology, which is to say life more fully, and where we go in 23 and beyond, that's going to be awesome.
4137448	4139510	B	0.8745231628417969	So, any last words, Andrew?
4141130	4143160	A	0.7360169291496277	No, I just echo what you said.
4144810	4155690	A	0.929115355014801	I would say it's going to be uphill in terms of how interesting it's going to get uphill in a good sense, meaning that we're planning cool.
4155760	4163654	B	0.5179455280303955	Well, I encourage people to check out the course website and submit questions that they'd like to see addressed by Chris.
4163702	4167494	B	0.7210500240325928	Also to register and join these participatory discussions.
4167542	4185714	B	0.7272353172302246	There'll be three more of them, so if you want to join, share your QRF, be part of the public of all of these works that we'll compile at the end and just get your exoskeleton in the game with what is happening here.
4185752	4191460	B	0.9767268896102905	It'd be really awesome to hear more voices and to have more on board.
4192310	4196180	B	0.9079222679138184	Okay, thank you, Dean, and Ander till next time.
4196550	4196830	A	0.5137447118759155	Bye.
