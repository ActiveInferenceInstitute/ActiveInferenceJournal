5970	7294	2	B	0.99995	Hello and welcome.
7412	21386	3	B	0.99953	It's July 29, 2023, and we're here in session three discussion of the course physics's Information Processing at the Active Inference Institute.
21578	32098	4	B	0.92093	We're having a follow up discussion on Chris Fields's third lecture on quantum reference frames, and we're looking forward to your participation.
32274	37942	5	B	0.9926	So if you're watching along live and you've been invited to the calendar event, it's not too late to jump in.
38076	45686	6	B	0.9997	If you're watching on YouTube, you can write any questions or comments in the live chat with Dean And.
45708	57594	7	B	0.84102	Ander here we're going to be looking at some of the key points and taking it in a few different directions, sharing our reference frames, making a shared one.
57712	74114	8	B	0.92182	So, Ander, would be awesome to have you zoom in a little bit on the slide and then feel free to take us through some of the key points so that we can see a little bit how you're seeing it.
74152	74900	9	B	0.99997	Thank you.
75670	76754	10	A	0.96899	That looks good.
76872	77540	11	A	1	Yes.
78070	86882	12	A	0.52877	Okay, so let's start by reviewing the last lecture from a couple of weeks ago, and then we can open up the discussions.
86946	90520	13	A	0.99961	If there's any questions that appear in the live chat, we can address those.
91230	91802	14	A	0.82161	All right.
91856	115398	15	A	0.92389	So lecture two, Chris introduced this idea of the information processing between system A and B, where they interact via qubits on a boundary, and they have reference frames that give meaning to this communication.
115594	125380	16	A	0.69423	You want to think of information processing as a communication channel, the way Shannon thought about it.
126230	127890	17	A	0.62647	So that was in lecture two.
128040	140246	18	A	0.62	And lecture three a couple weeks ago tried to make this more explicit by emphasizing the idea that this has to be physically embodied somewhere.
140358	140874	19	A	0.82373	Okay.
140992	164990	20	A	0.79	And I think that because we are so used to information being fungible in no small part because of the Internet and everything, it's a little hard to understand at first when the claim is made that you have a QRF that it's non fungible or you have a piece of quantum information that's non fungible or things like the no Cloning theorem.
165590	180550	21	A	0.98639	We're so used to information being fungible, to it being zeros and ones that it's a bit of a change in mindset at first, but that's exactly what lecture three introduced.
181130	183640	22	A	0.99998	This was all stuff, right?
184010	186198	23	B	0.99999	Could you maybe just unpack that a little bit?
186284	189522	24	B	1	What would it mean for information to be fungible?
189586	191350	25	B	0.99998	Or what's that stance like?
191420	194182	26	B	1	And then, what does it mean for information to be non fungible?
194246	196060	27	B	1	And what is that stance like?
196830	199578	28	A	0.99973	Yeah, I'm out to get there.
199664	203854	29	A	0.96239	So let me scroll down the slides, because that's addressed here.
203892	211886	30	A	0.99936	So maybe I should have kept this in the beginning, but anyways, session two talked about how information theory makes this simple and obvious.
211988	212640	31	A	0.98959	Okay.
213570	220980	32	A	0.55	And in session three, we talk about reference frames and mechanistically, how all of this works.
222710	230022	33	A	0.99976	So, yeah, let's address that question of the difference between hold on 1 second.
230076	233320	34	A	0.99054	Let me use my mouse to scroll down here.
235530	237346	35	A	0.68458	Okay, so that's a little faster.
237378	237960	36	A	0.98039	Right.
239370	240120	37	A	0.64992	Okay.
242110	244118	38	A	0.99095	Can you restate your question, Daniel?
244214	244474	39	A	0.99878	Yeah.
244512	248970	40	B	0.99996	What would it mean for information to be fungible or non fungible?
249470	257390	41	B	0.99999	People might be familiar with that in the economic setting with non fungible tokens and all of that, but what are we talking about with informational fungibility?
258850	264266	42	A	1	I think it basically comes down to whether you can replicate.
264298	267490	43	A	1	I mean, it's basically the difference between classical and quantum information.
267560	275460	44	A	1	As far as I know, fungible information is everything that you can basically turn into a message of zeros and ones.
279430	284038	45	A	0.99796	How you transmit it may be different, the channel, the physical hardware and so on.
284124	291738	46	A	0.63906	But at the end of the day, it's something that you can write on a boundary and something that you can transmit at zeros and ones.
291824	299350	47	A	0.99948	Whereas quantum information, you literally have to send the hardware, the piece of hardware, the QRF.
299510	301402	48	A	1	At least that's how I understand it.
301456	311114	49	A	0.99216	So a simple answer might be that it's information encoded in a piece of software versus a piece of hardware.
311162	314000	50	A	0.99837	But I don't think that analogy is perfect.
315750	316114	51	A	0.95842	Yeah.
316152	317300	52	B	0.99606	Dean, what do you think?
318710	320754	53	C	0.99714	Here's what I'm curious about.
320952	323602	54	C	1	And again, you guys can help me with this.
323736	330126	55	C	0.99959	As opposed to reference frames, I oftentimes default to frame of reference.
330158	337794	56	C	1	And I know that in one of the live streams, what I tried to bring out was the idea that there was an ice cream cone looking at an ice cream truck.
337922	346262	57	C	0.99	And the question was always whether or not which one of those two entities, one is in the foreground and one is in the background.
346326	369150	58	C	0.97	And in this slide that Ander has up the question is, is the non fungibility because only A and B can decide whether the VA as seen by B, the A is deeper into that image based on our frame of reference.
369230	376878	59	C	1	And the B is closer or is the B the one that's actually deeper and the A is the one that's in the foreground?
376974	392060	60	C	1	And I was wondering whether the idea of non copyability is because of that depth of field aspect that cannot be determined unless it's literally handed over the way that Chris was describing it.
392830	411840	61	A	1	I think that's basically think I'm not sure that I can answer your question, but I think I have the feeling that Chris well, Chris said this in the lecture, that at the end of the day, the KrF is somewhere in your nervous system.
413090	416858	62	A	0.93	And here whether you bring up a good point.
416884	417170	63	A	0.99962	Right.
417240	421070	64	A	0.99998	It looks like this slide is a bit of an optical illusion.
421150	427800	65	A	0.99999	Whether you see A or B deeper, I guess it depends on something going on inside your head.
429050	434310	66	A	0.99999	This picture is so symmetrical that if you focus enough on it, you can change your opinion.
436250	440010	67	B	0.99995	Just to even connect that to what we're talking about.
440080	453306	68	B	1	The classical fungible information on the Holographic screen, on the blanket, and then the quantum cognitive rotation is those two images are on the screen identical.
453498	472094	69	B	0.67	And then whether it gets a quantum rotation such that the three points of the axes are closer to us than the intersection on that kind of tetrahedron or the other way around, whether the ballerina is rotating one way or the other, that's not on the boundary.
472222	483190	70	B	0.99947	So the information about the depth of field is part of the QRF or part of the enactment of the QRF, and it's not written on the boundary.
486200	490100	71	C	0.99	And that goes back to the preparation question and not just the measuring.
490680	491140	72	A	0.99818	Yeah.
491210	516110	73	B	0.58316	Like if the preparation if your whole enculturation or the last five minutes it was entrained, or you were holding an object, that predisposed you to think that the vertex of the intersection was further away, that's the preparation sets your prior so that when you get this ambiguous artifact, you rotate it into the most natural position.
516740	518080	74	B	0.81032	Cognitively.
518500	520844	75	B	1	And that's the preparation that sets you up for a measurement.
520892	523200	76	B	0.99964	No measurement can happen without a preparation.
524180	525520	77	B	0.99969	What do you think, Ander?
527220	527970	78	A	0.99461	Sure.
528840	529204	79	A	0.87261	Yeah.
529242	530630	80	A	0.96646	Everything you said makes sense.
532680	550570	81	A	0.99711	So perhaps let me recall what was that around the slides in this whole spirit or philosophy of making, emphasizing that information is physical, it concubine this whole thing.
551580	578800	82	A	1	One of the glaring omissions in physics was the embodiment of the reference frame, which was treated as an abstraction in classical physics, such as by Galileo, but maybe even Einstein, even if he my hunch, is that he did have more of this instinct know, particularly in all those thought experiments of trying to chase the library.
579300	580732	83	A	0.99975	You are chasing the library.
580796	580976	84	A	0.92394	Right.
580998	590740	85	A	0.99146	So at the end of the I mean, this is the whole process of making the observer and the reference frame more and more explicit and more and more physical.
591180	593850	86	A	0.99588	Because at the end of the day, it has to right.
594460	616990	87	A	0.99836	If you start with this assumption, that solipsistic assumption almost, that all you see is part of the same material ether that you are, then you are part of the universe and you're observing something that is out there.
617520	622224	88	A	0.99938	So you need to include a theory of what it means for you to be observing that.
622262	622608	89	A	0.84166	Right.
622694	625724	90	A	1	And at the end of the day, the observer has to be physical.
625852	630256	91	A	0.95748	That's what was emphasized by Chris at the beginning of this lecture.
630448	650456	92	A	0.99981	So this jump from treating the reference frame as an abstraction to a real physical entity, these people have talked a lot about in these papers that are quoted there.
650558	657624	93	A	0.99973	But I should also remark, if folks want to see this, it's coming up in high energy theory.
657672	666856	94	A	0.99997	Also in recent work of Saskind and others, where they talk about quantum reference frames very explicitly.
666968	681940	95	A	0.99936	So I don't have the citations off the button, but it's definitely becoming an important thing in the last 20 years, this attempt to really explicitly treat the reference frame and the observer as a quantum entity, as a physical entity.
682680	694330	96	A	0.99506	Okay, so that's what I just said the jump from treating things reference rims as abstractions to physical objects go.
696620	708940	97	A	0.73	And because we cannot make a perfect copy of quantum information, we say that these are unique and clonable and unfungible.
710000	719184	98	A	0.78075	So in order to recreate an experiment perfectly, this is addressed as a part of fungibility or not.
719222	719664	99	A	0.74429	Right.
719782	734150	100	A	0.96217	Can Alice, if you have some sort of quantum experiment and Alice and, you know, it's the usual DPR thought experiment or whatever, alice and Bob are separated by light years.
735000	743850	101	A	0.84514	Is it enough, if they want to recreate the same, exact same experiment for Alice to send string of zeros and ones?
744460	751176	102	A	0.99951	Well, if you had an experiment where that's enough, then you can recreate it with fungible information.
751278	758860	103	A	0.99998	If not, then you need to somehow send non fungible information, which really implies sending a piece of hardware.
763710	769150	104	B	0.96413	Can I add another piece here on the previous slide?
769570	777562	105	B	0.89343	So this looks really technical and scientific, but let's think about Alice's laboratory.
777706	782266	106	B	0.99971	Is Alice's brain, mind and Bob's analogously?
782378	786370	107	B	0.9979	Alice is thinking about what to say and then says it.
786520	790402	108	B	0.99	And that information might be written in a chat form.
790456	795350	109	B	0.68673	It might be said verbally, it might be transmitted through digital or analog signal.
795770	799986	110	B	0.99857	But at some point it's going through this classical informational interface.
800018	804182	111	B	1	And then Bob's laboratory is like perceiving and unpacking it.
804316	817334	112	B	1	And the question of semantic alignment is such that if Alice gives a shopping list of ten items, if there's semantic alignment, bob would be able to go to the store and then find those ten items.
817462	822558	113	B	1	And it made me think of the dictionary definition of left and right.
822644	829390	114	B	0.68903	So this gets back to our discussion of whether the vertex on these axes is coming towards us or away from us.
829460	842158	115	B	0.99993	So I looked up the dictionary definition of left on towards or relating to the side of a human body or of a thing that is to the west when the person or that thing is facing north.
842334	846630	116	B	0.99837	So that's, I guess, one attempt to anchor what it means to be left.
846700	850194	117	B	1	The second definition is the left hand part side or direction.
850242	853270	118	B	1	And you could imagine there's an analogous definition for right.
853420	866890	119	B	1	The point is you can't describe verbally leftness and rightness or chirality in general because its reference is an embodied perspective.
867390	883010	120	B	0.99	And so if Alice said, okay, you're going to go down the street and then turn left at the stop sign, how would Alice communicate to Bob what leftness meant at that stop sign versus rightness?
884470	887250	121	B	1	And that's this question of flipping.
887670	909658	122	B	1	And the way that the quantum formalism accommodates that is through the WIC rotation and the quantum cognitive event where the fungible transmittable holographic information gets rotated into the imaginary axis with the formalisms that enable it to be rotated at all.
909744	913500	123	B	0.99982	But that means you could rotate it left quote or rotate it right.
915790	919962	124	A	0.99736	Yeah, I think that's a very good explanation.
920106	921854	125	A	1	I don't know if I have much to add.
921892	923440	126	A	0.80869	Dean you wanted to say.
927490	928074	127	C	0.71541	Can'T.
928122	957830	128	C	1	I don't know the answer to this, but to take what Daniel just said, to take the basic concept of being able to take something that, for all intents and purposes, can appear one way or another and then turn that into how Chris closed the last lecture with we are seeing ourselves as both being entangled and also being separatable.
957990	969834	129	C	1	How did we go literally from a three dimension vertex to we're both entangled and we're not living in a paradox.
969962	971742	130	C	0.50272	That's just the way it is.
971876	978174	131	C	0.99293	We're also removing ourselves or separating ourselves at the same time.
978292	988530	132	C	0.99998	That's what I would like to know, because somewhere between three arbitrary lines and complexity is not a paradox.
988870	994760	133	C	0.99999	Something has to be happening, and I'm not exactly sure how that transition plays out.
999120	1001230	134	C	0.99997	Anybody want to enlighten me?
1001840	1004172	135	A	0.99914	Can you repeat your question, please?
1004226	1017170	136	C	0.98776	Well, how do we go at this point of the reference frame description of saying, you can't copy it, all you can do is pass it?
1018740	1028180	137	C	1	Because we think things could be flipped based on internal reference frames, internal meanings and internal models.
1028520	1030064	138	C	1	The thing we choose for context.
1030112	1062908	139	C	0.93681	Yada yada yada yada goes all the way out to the conclusion of Chris's conversation with us in number three, where he said, bottom line is that it's not a paradox that as things become more and more complex, then it wants to get to a place of entanglement, alignment, a sense of agreement, and at the same time wants to remain separate.
1063004	1067890	140	C	0.99997	So between those two things, a whole lot has happened.
1068900	1076384	141	C	0.97	And I don't think we've skipped over it, but we certainly haven't opened it up and really looked at it closely.
1076432	1080820	142	C	1	And I'm just curious what's in between those two scales.
1081160	1081812	143	A	0.97	I agree.
1081866	1088536	144	A	0.99	I think we're going to cover that towards the end of the talk, but I agree.
1088718	1107356	145	A	1	I don't know how you see this related to QRS or the stuff we just talked about, but I think it's the big question in this lecture, right, that was like, where does this tension between increasing complexity and wanting to predict what the environment is doing?
1107458	1121296	146	A	1	One requires entanglement and the other one requires separability, at least colloquially speaking, I think this tension is basically what the free energy principle comes down to.
1121318	1121456	147	A	0.99412	Right.
1121478	1122770	148	A	0.59094	Daniel, what do you think?
1123300	1127060	149	A	0.99173	You have the free energy and you have the E minus TS.
1127560	1128864	150	A	1	One is prediction error.
1128912	1130816	151	A	0.98	I mean, not exactly E minus TS.
1130848	1130996	152	A	0.99087	Right?
1131018	1133456	153	A	0.99919	That would be thermodynamics but you know what I mean.
1133498	1138250	154	A	0.93	One is prediction error and the other one is what was?
1139340	1140650	155	A	0.69	I can remember.
1142940	1152604	156	B	0.97822	I'll definitely look forward to the technical unpacking that you'll get to soon, but I was reminded of the William Blake quotation, do what you will.
1152722	1156376	157	B	0.99985	This life's a fiction and is made up of contradiction.
1156568	1165600	158	B	0.99117	So let's modify that project what you will, rotate what you will, spacetime's a fiction.
1166020	1177232	159	B	1	Not that it's false, but that it's a projected fictionalization that it doesn't have the ontological primacy that the topology of communication does and is made up of contradiction.
1177376	1177780	160	B	1	Yes.
1177850	1193112	161	B	1	And it's made up of this tension between fitting and not overfitting, between aligning and the principle of unitarity and differentiating and becoming through others.
1193166	1205980	162	B	1	We become ourselves and that type of articulation and recognizing that two complementary forces like convex and concave come into existence at once.
1206050	1213440	163	B	0.99999	Like a zero to two jump is not an issue or a stumbling block.
1214020	1217170	164	B	0.98006	It's that we wouldn't have it any other way.
1218340	1220210	165	B	0.59733	Couldn't have it any other way.
1220820	1224016	166	A	0.78068	Yeah, sure, we'll get that.
1224038	1227584	167	A	0.99981	Towards the end, you can almost even call it a duality.
1227632	1229728	168	A	0.52209	It's not far fetched.
1229744	1233788	169	A	0.98	I mean, it's the sort of thing that I think most people will be happy to take for granted.
1233824	1241912	170	A	0.98659	Such supersymmetry like you have two kinds of particles, but the same amount of them, and dualities that are all over the place.
1241966	1256600	171	A	0.78718	So I think it's not unreasonable to just accept that there is a tension between increasing complexity, which you want A and B to be separable for, and accuracy prediction.
1256680	1268556	172	A	0.98581	Now, how this is related to emergent space and these QRS stuff, I don't want to make very far fetched claims.
1268588	1271190	173	A	0.99992	We'll talk about emergent space later on the course.
1272200	1279190	174	A	0.99994	But for now, let's say a few more words about QRFs and then we'll get to the complexity stuff towards the end.
1282120	1302684	175	A	0.76793	QRFs are almost building blocks, if you want, for information processing here, it's very useful to recall definition that I feel I think we have mentioned before of information as being differences that make a difference.
1302882	1307772	176	A	0.99899	That's probably the best colloquial definition of information I've heard.
1307826	1310224	177	A	1	And I think it does a lot of work.
1310262	1315216	178	A	1	I mean, it's almost mathematical, but anyways, we need to unpack it a little more and see.
1315318	1321424	179	A	0.8925	So for a difference to make a difference, what do you want out of QRF?
1321472	1322070	180	A	0.97344	Right.
1322680	1328470	181	A	0.51477	Unsurprisingly, I mean, not surprisingly, but reassuringly, I think would be the word.
1330120	1340168	182	A	0.99994	You need a QRF to have sensory action and a default state, right?
1340254	1346336	183	A	0.99987	This is sort of like where your Bayesian prior distribution is encoded.
1346468	1352312	184	A	0.99987	These three things will give you a building block for any information processing.
1352456	1364240	185	A	0.99	And that ties together with all the work in the free energy literature and perception action loops and whatnot.
1365140	1373216	186	A	0.99478	So before we see mathematically how a TRF is defined, I think it's more illustrative.
1373248	1383444	187	A	1	And I think Chris went exactly on the right order when he presented this a couple weeks ago, seeing examples from h.
1383642	1391960	188	A	0.93333	These are actual pieces of hardware that are effectively QRX, and it's remarkable how they map to well.
1392030	1393672	189	A	0.42237	I'll skip ahead a little bit.
1393726	1409256	190	A	0.997	But when you get to the mathematical definition of a QRF as a quantum system that you can specify with this category theory diagram, you have incoming arrows into a node that then expands.
1409288	1409484	191	A	0.9896	Right?
1409522	1418684	192	A	1	And this roughly corresponds to measurement and preparation degrees of not degrees of freedom, degrees of freedom would be the same, right, when you attach it to the boundary.
1418812	1422870	193	A	0.99655	But measurement and preparation stages, I guess, would be the better word.
1424600	1428500	194	A	0.95962	But anyways, let me go back to these examples, right?
1428650	1433448	195	A	0.74	And Daniel, you're the biologist here, so correct me if I say anything wrong here.
1433534	1443144	196	A	0.9998	You have a cartoon picture of a bacteria, I think, and this is a very simple sort of thing, right?
1443182	1449790	197	A	0.99789	It navigates in the direction of food and that's it, right?
1450240	1454600	198	A	0.99677	So it is a very simple rudimentary example of a cureb.
1454760	1463324	199	A	0.99978	You have the sensory stage here, I guess the degrees of freedom.
1463372	1465040	200	A	0.76	I guess the degrees of freedom.
1466260	1469490	201	A	0.89834	It's not obvious here what the boundary is, that's one thing.
1470420	1481716	202	A	0.99992	But it is a good enough picture to see the resemblance to here we have the measurement which in this case you're trying to measure concentration of food.
1481898	1492490	203	A	0.99999	You have your node here, C, which is your prior distribution for concentration of food.
1492860	1504604	204	A	1	And finally you have the output, the preparation stage, which is the rest of this chemical network that will control and steer this bacteria, right?
1504642	1513730	205	A	0.99971	So there is here you want to call it the action degrees of freedom that will steer this bacteria in the direction of food.
1514180	1519840	206	A	0.55	And likewise with cell division, this I understand even less that the network appears more complicated.
1520840	1536920	207	A	0.99764	But I think it's fair to say that at the end of the day, all these chemical networks that appear super complicated somehow have to be mapped to this category theoretical diagram.
1537580	1539048	208	A	0.92424	That's all there is to it.
1539134	1552750	209	A	0.9334	You're going to have the sensory input and the action output and you're going to have the default chemical concentration which amounts to this node over here.
1556320	1559304	210	A	0.90213	You remember this from last lecture, right, Daniel?
1559432	1559868	211	B	0.99996	Yeah.
1559954	1566796	212	B	0.73	And the Cone Co cone we explored also in live stream 17 on the Bayesian semantic information flow.
1566908	1580352	213	B	0.99998	But I'll kind of add a point about these biological systems in relationship to artificially specified systems and what that helps us understand about perception, cognition, action.
1580496	1599272	214	B	0.99494	So the cone COCONE diagram has this bow tie architecture or this kind of like two pyramids touching point to point where there's a preparation and a measurement which can be different dimensionalities or different scopes.
1599416	1605388	215	B	0.99996	Like it could be multi input, multi output or multi input, single output, vice versa and so on.
1605554	1611760	216	B	0.99999	But they come through this eye of the needle with C prime here.
1611910	1623350	217	B	0.81826	Now, contrast that kind of architecture represented here abstractly, with what we see in the bacterial process and in the cell division process.
1623720	1636680	218	B	0.99988	These have that kind of a bow tie perception, cognition, action architecture or measurement, cognitive integration, preparation architecture.
1637580	1661516	219	B	0.99999	In contrast, we see, for example, an artificial neural network where the input and the output layers are usually lower dimensional, maybe an image coming in with several hundred pixels and a single output like a classifier coming out the other end, but a dimensional explosion in those internal cognitive layers.
1661708	1664204	220	B	0.99996	But in biological systems.
1664332	1666476	221	B	0.99989	It's actually exactly the opposite.
1666588	1674564	222	B	0.99998	For example, many, many receptors on the cell surface, on the holographic boundary, the sensorium of the cell.
1674762	1682580	223	B	0.99972	But then there are these common secondary messengers that many pathways converge upon.
1683100	1713040	224	B	0.98966	So that reflects the kind of radically different architecture that a QRF embodies, as opposed to the approach taken by disembodied intelligence frameworks which use dimensional explosion internally to try to categorize and classify and find edge cases versus this dimensional winnowing that is reflective of these embodied intelligences.
1715620	1733624	225	A	0.99	And if I may make a tangential comment here also, I think the good thing about these two examples is that they also showcase the fact of how the deep implications of scale free biology, if you want to call it this way.
1733662	1746596	226	A	0.99997	We tend to think of these sorts of processes such as here only happening at the level of the nervous system in animals, or as you said, neural networks.
1746628	1746872	227	A	0.99659	Right.
1746926	1749420	228	A	1	We tend to associate this with neural networks.
1749920	1756988	229	A	0.95	And perhaps evolution has tiered us in a way that endowed us with nervous systems to make these things.
1757074	1764720	230	A	1	Maybe these are higher up in the layers, but really that's a bit of an arbitrary distinction that we make.
1764870	1771350	231	A	1	The processes going on at the cellular level, even if they don't appear to have anything to do with nervous system.
1772280	1792360	232	A	0.99983	My understanding is that there are some generic properties that are the same and everything that has to do with information processing, it manifests maybe slightly different when it comes to explicit neurons, but at the end of the day, it's the same generic process going on.
1792430	1792936	233	A	0.99552	Would you say?
1792958	1794360	234	A	0.9997	That's right, Daniel?
1796880	1808540	235	B	1	The ontological claim is that it's the same generic process happening, whereas the more instrumentalist claim is that we can model it with some shared abstractions.
1811460	1812064	236	A	0.99276	Yeah.
1812182	1814128	237	A	0.53665	Okay, so we can continue.
1814214	1814850	238	A	0.97074	Right?
1816500	1824004	239	A	0.74859	So from, you know, I don't have a whole lot to say.
1824042	1840760	240	A	0.54766	Daniel said quite a bit about at the end of the day, QRF, you can visualize it as this diagram and you can think of it as if you are more familiar with the picture of a neural network and ways on a neural network and so on.
1840910	1843210	241	A	0.99773	That's the way to think about it.
1844380	1848776	242	A	0.99998	Now, let's continue with explicit embodiment, if you wish.
1848968	1858460	243	A	0.97405	So QRFs in the formalism have to be attached to a boundary boundary degrees of freedom.
1858540	1874820	244	A	1	And I should add another remark here, and personally to me also, the hard part about this quantum free energy principle, formalism, if you wish, is what you said at the beginning is the fact that it's topological, right?
1874890	1878196	245	A	0.9989	So very often it's not clear what the boundary degrees of freedom are.
1878378	1878772	246	A	0.65837	Right?
1878826	1888520	247	A	0.99162	Because we tend to think of boundaries as geometrical and certainly the classical FEP treats them as geometrical.
1889340	1899180	248	A	0.92074	But that's not the case here in the quantum free energy formalism where we have emergent space will be talked about in later sessions.
1899760	1916400	249	A	0.94441	But that's just like one quick remark to make at the end of the day, though, even if it's topological, we're going to have real degrees of freedom that this URF is attaching to this cone cocoon diagram.
1916740	1925670	250	A	0.97	And you're going to have measurement operators that yield classical outcomes plus and minus one.
1929160	1946780	251	A	0.97	And then you can think of this QRF or more abstractly, this concoction diagram as a neural network, if it was acting on those Ander qubits and then back propagating some sort of action signal preparation.
1949360	1964000	252	A	0.78246	Okay, let's not forget that Lambdawer's principle and so on requires that we are mindful of energy constraints on computation.
1964660	1968320	253	A	1	And that gives us the following picture.
1971960	1983868	254	A	0.9999	Number one, we're going to have to use energy from the environment to fuel our computation, to fuel our observation.
1984064	1990090	255	A	0.99965	That means that right away you cannot use the entirety of your boundary to gather information.
1991180	1996192	256	A	0.79535	It necessitates an allocation of resources.
1996276	2013376	257	A	0.94658	Right here, E is the observed environment, and the blue portion is A, thermodynamical sector where you extract free energy and dump heat in order to run this computational process.
2013558	2021220	258	A	0.98	And then furthermore, you can have a memory sector where you write things on a boundary, and this takes up energy.
2021290	2026150	259	A	0.65382	Also, writing information onto the boundary by Landauer's Principle will take up information.
2027720	2046540	260	A	0.97	And Chris called this the minimal interesting observer because it has a memory sector, and quite minimal here implies that we have at least minimal interesting implies that we have more than one layer here.
2046610	2057820	261	A	0.54	The process of writing things into a memory sector requires us to have a clock so that we can label those memories in time.
2057890	2062290	262	A	0.99413	Okay, so we do have time as part of this formalism, just not space yet.
2063060	2066960	263	A	0.9993	Time has to be internal to the observer.
2068020	2072470	264	B	0.99887	Just one piece on that that Chris mentioned.
2074040	2091370	265	B	0.73	And as you echoed, time here is an attribute of some cognitive systems in terms of their internal understanding so that they can sort memories and understand what came earlier or later.
2091900	2099516	266	B	0.82391	It's not something that's a priori defined externally, which is the case in the kind of spacetime first.
2099618	2102350	267	B	0.80448	Now, how do we fit communication into here?
2102960	2113996	268	B	0.99999	We flip that we're talking about the topology of communication as ontologically, primal and now certain kinds of sophisticated agents.
2114098	2127940	269	B	0.43032	This is not like necessarily true of a rock or a metronome or a particle of a gas, but some kinds of cognitive systems are such that they are able to generate an internal clock concept.
2128360	2133244	270	B	0.98	And that doesn't have to be the same thing as what's happening on the wall with Kronos.
2133312	2140356	271	B	0.99697	This can reflect a purely internal time kairos that enables observers or interactors that have different clock structures.
2140468	2150072	272	B	0.99	And then Landauer's principle helps us arbitrage or connect the informational demands to the energetic or the metabolic demands.
2150136	2168560	273	C	0.86571	Dean so when I first listened to the lecture, I thought when the term or phrase trade off was raised, I traditionally have thought of trade off as kind of a binary.
2168980	2175956	274	C	0.67452	If I'm picking this, I'm trading off against all the other things that I didn't pick.
2176138	2180240	275	C	0.89545	So one or the other or others plural.
2180400	2194948	276	C	0.99995	But when I saw this, and especially when I heard it in the context of things like degrees of freedom, I began to wonder whether it is because it could sit on either side of that boundary.
2194964	2210624	277	C	0.97778	It could be a priori or it could be ad hoc or post hoc, a trade off which prior to this conversation, I just assumed that a trade off was one or the other.
2210822	2214450	278	C	0.55019	But essentially what this implies is.
2216740	2217196	279	A	0.87749	It'S.
2217228	2230036	280	C	0.99987	Still a kind of a degree of how much weight you put into it and then you kind of cross a threshold and then you've made your pick, you've completed your trade off.
2230138	2236084	281	C	0.99996	Or again, did I misinterpret what I was hearing?
2236212	2252030	282	C	0.99893	If it's topological as opposed to the more conventional spacetime perspective, can a trade off be both ad hoc and post hoc, seemingly at the same time?
2257700	2259410	283	B	0.99996	Very interesting question.
2260100	2263670	284	B	0.99974	Let us just let it float and continue on enter.
2264120	2265076	285	C	0.98497	All right.
2265258	2269270	286	C	0.8543	Because again, I'll just say this.
2269720	2284170	287	C	0.99999	If it can be, that would really move us out of the classical realm that would essentially say that anytime we've made a pick, we really haven't made a pick.
2284620	2297592	288	C	0.51484	There's still a whole bunch of other things that are going to happen that can change whatever that action is that we thought we carried out or enacted.
2297736	2309680	289	C	0.99998	If we're talking about an internal, internality state, which is what I think we want, I think we want to be able to change our minds.
2312920	2314772	290	B	0.98755	Let me take that one way.
2314906	2315700	291	B	0.99795	Dean.
2317000	2347176	292	B	0.96	The analytical equations of the Action perception loop don't tell us in implementation like if we're going to write it in code, whether we should use Action first procedurally to update our observations, or whether we enable our observations to wag the dog and then select Action at the end of the loop.
2347208	2350892	293	B	0.99997	So is it a perception action loop or is it an action perception loop?
2351036	2374720	294	B	0.87	And those enable a kind of seesaw where sometimes we want what we learn to change what we do and other times we want what we do to change what we learn and having that kind of a fulcrum or a pivot and again to connect it to the vertex popping in and out.
2374890	2383560	295	B	0.99	The analytical formalisms inscribed on the screen of the FEP, like the textbooks, they're ambiguous.
2384060	2418704	296	B	0.99991	Whether we lead with action and have inference follow or whether we lead with inference and have action follow or lead with action have inference follow whichever one of the combinations there are, and then that trade off or runoff is broken by specific embodied cognitive agents that trade off about the procedural primacy of perception or action can't be broken.
2418832	2420950	297	B	0.99935	Generically, right?
2425580	2426360	298	A	0.01774	MMM.
2429630	2432650	299	C	0.99996	It certainly makes for a lot of waste heat if you're not careful.
2436790	2439220	300	C	0.5088	It'd be exhausting a lot anyway.
2442090	2442840	301	A	0.91126	Okay.
2446890	2454342	302	A	1	I don't know if we can talk about intent much with this formalism, but.
2454396	2466060	303	A	0.99999	We can take a very descriptive approach to it and go down here a little more actually before I don't want to get ahead of myself.
2466430	2493300	304	A	1	What I mean by that is whether we can put intent or not in this hierarchy, I don't know if it matters a whole lot, but at least we can talk about it operationally and descriptively and say just like when you have a clock, the clock is just there, right?
2494890	2498086	305	A	0.99999	If you don't have the clock, you don't have the memory and that's it, right?
2498268	2512540	306	A	0.73	And likewise here, if we don't have an attention control compartment, we cannot play with all these QRFs that are non commutative at the same time.
2512910	2521514	307	A	0.99371	So if there is no attention control system to begin with, we cannot talk about a system that has non commutative cure apps.
2521562	2527120	308	A	0.99988	Meaning here, one presumably goes to memory sectors, the other one goes to environment sectors and so on.
2531930	2548650	309	A	0.33881	So this is certainly a necessity of the fact that we have different sectors of the boundary being allocated to different purposes, such as environmental observation and memory and so on, within the environment.
2550190	2564622	310	A	0.99941	It's worth remarking that here, if you think deeply about first principles and what it means to observe an entity, well, you still come down to these differences that make a difference sort of thing.
2564676	2565182	311	A	0.99983	Right.
2565316	2578494	312	A	0.99999	Which involves whenever you're looking at the environment, if you're going to identify a system, you need sort of a background that tells you that puts the system in context.
2578542	2578802	313	A	0.99971	Right.
2578856	2581994	314	A	1	So that you can identify the system as something distinct.
2582142	2611534	315	A	0.58	I think this, again, is something that we have talked about in previous discussions where the easiest picture here is something like the speed gauge in your car, where P is the gauge itself that tells you the speed, but it's meaningless without the reference system right, outside of the thing that stays invariant, right?
2611652	2617070	316	A	1	The context, the background that gauge moving means nothing to you.
2617220	2633510	317	A	0.99751	So we come back to this idea of if we think of information as differences that make a difference in terms of first principles, this environment sector that we saw earlier has to be further broken down into pointer and reference estates.
2634490	2639762	318	A	0.99943	Again, this is covered in depth in Chris's papers.
2639906	2644790	319	A	0.65779	I'm thinking particularly of free energy for generating quantum systems.
2646990	2665390	320	A	1	And again, just to reiterate this attention control staff compartment, which is, by the way, very reminiscent to the hierarchy that was earlier, with the clock arising higher up in the hierarchy, deeper into the layer.
2666770	2672298	321	A	0.8641	Likewise, whenever you're writing something into MMR, you need to have that clock.
2672394	2680174	322	A	0.99909	Whenever you are deploying noncommunicated gear apps, you're going to need an attention control compartment.
2680302	2682950	323	A	1	And we just described this operationally.
2683690	2691030	324	A	0.99982	If you didn't have it, then the agent would not be what it is, could not deploy those noncommutative QRFs.
2692810	2702460	325	A	0.99736	So, marching on, we'll just end here with QRF alignment and the free energy principle.
2702620	2704304	326	A	0.99998	Just a few more words.
2704502	2728516	327	A	0.99998	This is possibly the most interesting picture in this presentation and just we can recall here the possibilities for KrF alignment and how free energy comes into play in this formalism we call a the trivial interaction.
2728548	2731240	328	A	0.97971	We call this a thermal interaction.
2732640	2734604	329	A	1	And then you have a bunch of possibilities, right?
2734642	2746160	330	A	0.71	And depending on each possibility, you're going to see things as noise or as in the paper says, non local hidden variables.
2747540	2757040	331	A	1	The last situation is what we call alignment when we have QRFs of the same size, perfectly aligned.
2760120	2772806	332	A	0.90309	Recall, I think this would be the situation where you have noiseless classical computation, right?
2772908	2775270	333	A	0.8424	You have A and B just interacting.
2777210	2788582	334	A	0.69	And also this is the situation where, correct me if I'm wrong, Daniel, this is Entanglements, right?
2788636	2799130	335	A	0.98341	Asymptotically once all the curves are aligned, you have entanglement and now we can tie it back maybe to Dean's earlier.
2799290	2804560	336	A	0.98721	So these two slides conclude the discussion basically and then we can open it up.
2805570	2826230	337	A	0.99258	So given these possibilities for how QRFs can be aligned, QRFs deployed by AMD can be aligned, and how in each situation you're going to get noise or whatever, then what does the free energy principle say in this quantum setting?
2827210	2827960	338	C	0.99652	Well.
2830330	2834230	339	A	0.6956	Minimizing variational, free energy leads you to entanglements.
2835630	2848170	340	A	0.99069	So if theorem here, if you are in the picture of B here and the QRFs are aligned, a and B are going to be intact.
2852340	2870400	341	A	0.99779	Now, there is a tension between this tendency towards alignment as free energy principle will carry you and observe reality, which is that we're not just a Blob of Entangled particles.
2870480	2885850	342	A	0.77624	There is separability and systems are attention between maintaining separability and at the same time being correlated enough to the environment so as to be able to predict it.
2887200	2892700	343	A	0.93	And now we can maybe go into a more philosophical discussion about the free energy principle.
2893200	2912820	344	A	1	I should also say in the last month, just like I talked earlier, TRFs Lenny Suskin, whose recent paper that talks about TRF led me into a rabbit hole of looking into his recent work and he's talked a lot about complexity.
2913560	2921872	345	A	0.98741	I'm being very speculative here, so if someone can call me out, that would be good in the comments.
2922016	2937608	346	A	0.99998	But just skimming through some of his papers, I saw a monograph in 2018 where he talks about complexity and he puts forward this second law for complexity in quantum systems and increased complexity.
2937784	2940732	347	A	1	And it is very reminiscent of what's going on here.
2940786	2960960	348	A	0.99991	You have a tension between systems tending to entanglement and the other side of the free energy functional, if you wish, where systems increase in complexity and that necessarily requires that A and B are separate.
2961640	2964550	349	A	0.63117	So Daniel, do you have any comments at this point?
2966520	2968404	350	B	0.9993	Yeah, there's a lot to it.
2968602	2979524	351	B	1	I like that you showed the four possibilities in the image above and said it was one of the most interesting figures.
2979652	2982330	352	B	0.97	I agree.
2982940	3012560	353	B	0.96	And how to connect this to the classical FEP and also how to see the quantum FEP not as just a second story built on top of the classical FEP which would be kind of like a historical chronological understanding of the theoretical apparatus.
3012720	3024012	354	B	0.99928	But it's almost like the quantum FEP was like a basement we didn't know about because it gives a broader context.
3024096	3037900	355	B	1	And though it appeared conceptually several years later in the timeline we understand that doesn't give it a secondary status.
3038800	3063090	356	B	0.99858	So what it really means for the classical FEP to be kind of like a special case of this actually more generic setting there's just a lot I'm very.
3066200	3071796	357	A	0.76	I can wrap it up and then if Dean or you want to say something, we can continue with that.
3071818	3084532	358	A	0.92459	But let me conclude and this is all I have to say for mean, I'm sure Chris will explain this more in coming sessions and lectures.
3084596	3090350	359	A	0.99722	But I think the main key differences is in the emergence of space.
3090720	3096300	360	A	0.9997	How it might emerge from something more fundamental, maybe a tensor network or who knows?
3096800	3100384	361	A	0.98501	But that's the big difference, right?
3100502	3108560	362	A	0.8	And I suppose the quantum free energy principle generalizes the classical free energy principle because it doesn't have this spatial embedding.
3108900	3122052	363	A	0.99967	Now, this to me personally and also to folks in the audience for asking questions is probably the hardest part to wrap your head around.
3122186	3131290	364	A	0.5	And I foresee interest in those discussions and lectures that deal with the concept of emergent space.
3132060	3145656	365	A	0.99992	Because every time you try to and I've done this myself I've been thinking about how you could apply this formalism to better known pictures or compared it, for instance, with thermal equilibrium, with relaxation, with thermal equilibrium.
3145688	3148664	366	A	1	And then you start thinking about, okay, what is the boundary and so on.
3148802	3150144	367	A	0.97228	It's far from obvious, right?
3150182	3155356	368	A	0.66813	Because, again, you have to remind yourself that the definition is topological.
3155548	3168790	369	A	0.99983	So in that regard, I think it might be worth talking about one of the questions that came up that I thought was good and then I can call it a day on this end.
3171080	3175156	370	A	0.99736	So this question and I think it was the first question asked since the.
3175338	3180664	371	B	0.99996	Last lecture can you just read the full question and then read the full answer?
3180702	3181448	372	A	0.99998	Thank you.
3181614	3183352	373	A	0.75	The answer, it's number 28 here.
3183406	3184184	374	A	0.99999	Can you guys see it?
3184222	3185848	375	A	0.99997	Should I zoom in it a little bit?
3186014	3188908	376	B	0.91983	It's pretty small, but reading it will be good.
3189074	3189452	377	A	0.99917	Okay.
3189506	3197564	378	A	0.99983	So this question I think I've asked myself this question too, maybe in a different way.
3197602	3201330	379	A	0.99999	But basically it gets to the point of what I was saying earlier, right?
3202500	3216288	380	A	0.97386	That it would be nice to see how we can use this quantum free energy principle formalism to recover maybe familiar settings such as relaxation to thermal equilibrium via the heat equation.
3216384	3220550	381	A	0.99998	But that's far from obvious how you do it if your definition is topological, right?
3222520	3226840	382	A	0.99991	So the question says, what happens when the agent becomes identical to the environment?
3227500	3231252	383	A	0.99997	When the model has been improved so much that it does not differ from the environment.
3231316	3232632	384	A	0.99867	Is this a state even possible?
3232686	3237060	385	A	0.58674	Would it be thermodynamical equilibrium maximum entanglement?
3237220	3257904	386	A	0.99916	Okay, so clearly it's not thermodynamical equilibrium, but I think what the person is asking if maybe if I'm understanding this correctly, they're wondering, okay, so if the free energy principle drives A and B towards entanglement, then it's fair to say that any distinction between them has dissolved, right?
3257942	3259890	387	A	0.99427	That they have merged into the same thing.
3262760	3271460	388	A	0.94788	That has to do with this whole definition of philosophical debate of thingness that Karl Prieston is a proponent of, right?
3271610	3274380	389	A	0.99917	What it means for two things to be separate.
3274560	3277770	390	A	0.37974	Okay, so let's see what Chris said.
3281260	3288472	391	A	0.8079	Kristen has pointed out that the limit of the classical FEP, the limit of perfect prediction, corresponds to generalized synchrony between system and environment.
3288536	3292380	392	A	0.99996	Each sends messages that the other can perfectly predict.
3293840	3298852	393	A	0.99292	Now, however, it's clear I'm not reading anymore.
3298936	3300992	394	A	0.81804	I'm making a quick remark here.
3301046	3302544	395	A	0.9885	I'll continue in a second.
3302742	3317440	396	A	0.99978	In the classical FEP, it's clear that A and B, even if they are in the perfect limit of the FEP, they remain different entities.
3317520	3317764	397	A	0.86226	Right?
3317802	3327876	398	A	0.88041	Because you have that, if you wish, that extra layers of differentiation coming from their spatial embedding.
3327988	3328600	399	A	0.73133	Right?
3328750	3337812	400	A	0.99992	In the classical FEP that is clear that they haven't even if they are getting synchronized, they have not lost their separate identities.
3337876	3342460	401	A	0.99997	You can always say, well, this is the one that was to the left and this is the one that was to the right.
3342530	3345070	402	A	0.9899	Pun intended with earlier discussion, right?
3346240	3355536	403	A	0.99999	You have that extra resource for separating them, if you wish, by virtue of the special embedding, right?
3355558	3362880	404	A	1	The special embedding is giving you this extra information that allows you to keep track of amb separately.
3363460	3364212	405	A	0.98657	So I'll continue.
3364266	3368816	406	A	1	This notion depends on the system and its environment being separated and hence distinguished somehow.
3369008	3373556	407	A	0.66245	In classical formulations, they are separated in ordinary 3D space, I e.
3373578	3375500	408	A	0.99075	They occupy different locations.
3375600	3377940	409	A	0.99751	So they are different because they occupy different locations.
3378020	3378360	410	A	0.92639	Right.
3378430	3383832	411	A	0.99916	But if you don't have that geometrical background, then how you know that they're different, right?
3383966	3385864	412	A	0.78584	Okay, so I continue.
3386062	3390232	413	A	1	The quantum formulation is background free, meaning it assumes no spacetime embedding.
3390296	3396830	414	A	0.99999	System and environment do not have different locations, even though they have different sets of degrees of freedom in the overall Hilbert space.
3398160	3399660	415	A	0.99162	Here the FPP.
3400240	3403120	416	A	0.99	The limit of the FEP is maximum entanglement.
3403460	3406252	417	A	0.71761	This does not mean that the system and its environment are identical.
3406316	3406656	418	A	0.90011	They are.
3406678	3408700	419	A	0.6	And they have different degrees of freedom.
3408780	3413452	420	A	0.56475	Okay, so this is just addresses the question I just posed.
3413596	3421860	421	A	0.99913	It means that the joint state is not separable into a system S and environment e.
3422010	3424684	422	A	0.673	Their states are no longer conditionally independent.
3424832	3437160	423	A	0.90784	This is distinct from thermal equilibrium, which means that they have the same temperature while remaining separable and that their interaction can be characterized as the change of thermal fluctuations I E noise.
3439760	3442876	424	A	0.53434	So I guess this is a nice warm up for things that are to come.
3442978	3462790	425	A	0.99983	But I do think that this whole idea of emergent space is going to be possibly one of the most important in the course, and it's going to help the gap between the class and quantum formulations, for sure.
3464440	3466390	426	B	0.51521	Dean, what's your take on this?
3467160	3478600	427	C	0.99909	What I saw was that when you have that kind of alignment, that perfect alignment, that was one that was D in that diagram, right?
3478670	3490588	428	C	0.99989	That was one state of a complex state that included an A and a B and a C and probably a whole bunch of other ways that yeah, right.
3490674	3499012	429	C	0.99993	So that one state where you've got this kind of entanglement isn't into perpetuity.
3499096	3501008	430	C	0.85769	Like you don't get there and then stay there.
3501094	3517540	431	C	1	And that's where, I think, the question of separability and complexity, it still works because just because you've momentarily gotten to a place that we define here as D doesn't mean you stay there indefinitely.
3517880	3523140	432	C	0.99998	You could be swapping around to B and C and A in the next instant.
3523740	3528730	433	C	0.94965	So at least that holds the complexity piece up.
3529900	3533544	434	C	0.99986	That moment for however long that moment is.
3533662	3537420	435	C	0.99999	Where X A and X B are aligned isn't permanent.
3537760	3540316	436	C	0.98449	So it's not predictable in that sense.
3540418	3542460	437	C	0.99689	Therefore it is complex.
3543280	3550690	438	C	1	I still don't know how we get, though, that the closer we get to agreement, the more complex things are.
3551700	3560940	439	C	0.99974	Unless we're just talking about D in this array of ABC and D that goes back to that quantum reference frame.
3561020	3573924	440	C	1	I think, like I said, again, maybe I'm interpreting this wrong, but when I message pass the reason why, I have to literally give it over to the other person and let them have it.
3573962	3575844	441	C	1	I can't have them copy.
3575892	3597640	442	C	1	What I'm doing is because there has to be, I guess that reinforces the separability piece of this as well, the fact that I can't give them a copy, that I can only give them the information, and then they've got to sort of unpack it in their own way of taking it off the boundary.
3597800	3602048	443	C	0.95906	But again, I struggle with this.
3602214	3618630	444	C	0.47603	I'm guilty as charged, but what I'm trying to do is trying to come up with my own narrative, so that what Chris is saying makes sense to me, as opposed to make sense to the world, which is what Chris is trying to do.
3620440	3623540	445	B	0.9991	I'll try with another speculative fiction.
3623900	3630712	446	B	0.99883	So there's a screen between, let's just say, the stage and the audience or whatever.
3630766	3632392	447	B	0.99994	It's a holographic screen.
3632526	3637790	448	B	1	And on each side of the screen, there's some embodied object.
3638400	3648072	449	B	0.99997	So that means that it's a volume enclosing object because points and lines and planes are only abstractions.
3648136	3650892	450	B	1	Every real physical object encloses volume.
3651036	3657920	451	B	1	And now a light is going to be coming from behind each object facing the screen.
3658070	3662644	452	B	0.98	And that's this kind of cone that we're seeing from each side.
3662682	3665348	453	B	0.99665	It's like the shadow cast by the object.
3665514	3673076	454	B	0.99995	So if the object was a sphere, then it would be projecting down to a circle onto the screen.
3673258	3677704	455	B	0.98536	If the shape were a cube, it could be projecting down.
3677742	3688920	456	B	1	And so where the light is positioned is the perspective that that cognitive entity is taking on its QRF.
3689420	3690604	457	B	1	Those lights could move.
3690642	3693420	458	B	0.99995	So now we have the situation where the two spotlights are moving.
3693570	3696748	459	B	0.99991	Maybe the shapes are staying the same, maybe they're changing too.
3696914	3717620	460	B	1	And it's like two search lights scanning across this B oval and sometimes they are perfectly locked or there could be a situation where they're perfectly aligned or there could be situations where they're totally disjoint.
3719720	3732970	461	B	1	And each of those situations have different implications for what one entity sees when it looks at the screen.
3733500	3741404	462	B	0.99997	Maybe like the shadow is the only part where you can see because the rest of it is too blinding or something like that.
3741602	3759120	463	B	1	And so then if we're in case A here where maybe B doesn't have a projection or maybe B's projection is totally somewhere else, then A is in this solipsistic I'm the active agent interacting within an inert world setting.
3760020	3780520	464	B	1	And D is like potentially the computer engineer's classical dream or Asymptote, which is like all the data going through the USB cable is just being perfectly noiselessly received.
3781180	3786200	465	B	0.99	And then we also get these B and C cases.
3787020	3790430	466	B	0.9973	But A is kind of like the inert world.
3791600	3799096	467	B	0.99	D is like the perfect communication channel and then to connect it just to Friston's concept of generalized synchrony.
3799208	3804204	468	B	0.99987	As we've talked about many times, generalized synchrony doesn't mean lockstep.
3804332	3812420	469	B	1	Two agents could reduce their uncertainty about each other, not by doing the same thing at every time step, but for example by turn taking.
3812570	3831012	470	B	1	And I think that points the way to how we get reduction of variational free energy, reduction of prediction error, surprise and so on without especially spatial temporal enmeshment, but not necessarily even informational identity enmeshment.
3831156	3842136	471	B	1	Because you could have two things that through their alignment become actually differentiated and that could increase the mutual information between two metronomes.
3842248	3847992	472	B	1	Not just to have them going in the same direction, but to have them going in opposite directions.
3848136	3851730	473	B	0.85	The mutual information in those two settings is going to be high.
3852100	3863700	474	B	0.99999	So it's not the case that generalized synchrony means that things are becoming blurred.
3864920	3876040	475	B	0.99998	We could actually also have integrated information through increased articulation, not just decreased.
3876620	3881450	476	B	1	And then life finds a way or cognition finds a way.
3882060	3895396	477	B	0.99998	On this trade off frontier of in our pursuit of unitarity, will we blur to unify or will we differentiate to unify?
3895588	3897896	478	B	0.99998	But those are the paths we have.
3898078	3900960	479	B	0.99932	We don't have the backwards.
3903700	3906290	480	C	0.5325	Yeah, yeah, makes sense.
3913720	3917220	481	B	0.99211	Any other latter slides ender?
3917800	3919030	482	A	0.99931	No, that's it.
3919480	3932116	483	A	0.97736	So Chris made a few more remarks at the end about language here, but he mentioned that he's going to talk more about this in the coming lecture.
3932148	3934410	484	A	0.99979	So we'll just leave it up to him.
3938650	3939494	485	B	0.99736	Yeah.
3939692	3961180	486	B	0.99998	There could be some very powerful and interesting linguistic opportunities for updating our speaking to reflect what we are learning here.
3962590	4013580	487	B	1	I don't know what those necessarily are, whether it's a syntactic or a semantic thing or whether it's a narrative thing, but how to actually reenter some of these formalisms into our focus understanding could just be immensely powerful and we could have a lot of integrity between the natural language way that potentially were already showing up for engagement and some of these formalisms that get to first principles about interacting entities and boundary conditions and all of that.
4015490	4017950	488	B	0.98316	Dean, any penultimate thoughts?
4018450	4019454	489	C	0.99714	Not really.
4019652	4035806	490	C	0.95105	I'm going to go back and listen to the I'm going to listen to Chris's comments again about this common cause and the fine tuning assumption and whether that's sort of metaphorically, a dialing in or what he means exactly by the fine tuning.
4035918	4046790	491	C	0.51407	In the context of this conversation today, what you just kind of said about are we dulling something here or are we sculpting something to make it more fittable?
4048010	4056860	492	C	0.79743	I'm going to go now and go back and listen to what he talks about in terms of fine tuning and maybe update my priors around that.
4060670	4068160	493	B	1	And are there any last thoughts or maybe scroll over to the schedule of the course again just so we can close on that?
4070370	4072718	494	B	0.99534	Yeah, we're halfway through.
4072804	4080590	495	B	1	We just completed the third discussion section now, so we've had three lectures and three discussions.
4080750	4082900	496	B	0.9993	It's all downhill from here.
4083670	4085810	497	B	0.99996	By the way, this was the first midterm.
4086470	4088180	498	B	0.99991	You guys both did well.
4090150	4106326	499	B	0.66639	We're going to head into session four with these last three, how agents use multiple communication channels and that's going to get connected to the quantum FEP, how spacetime emerges from communication, which is something that we've brought up a bunch.
4106438	4110054	500	B	0.99974	It's been in the background, but making that explicit is going to be exciting.
4110102	4124750	501	B	1	And then section six, I think, is just going to be such a jumping off point because the scope and the intensity of what is transpiring is extreme.
4125090	4137346	502	B	0.99994	So connecting it to biology, which is to say life more fully, and where we go in 23 and beyond, that's going to be awesome.
4137448	4139510	503	B	0.99955	So, any last words, Ander?
4141130	4143160	504	A	0.92131	No, I just echo what you said.
4144810	4155690	505	A	1	I would say it's going to be uphill in terms of how interesting it's going to get uphill in a good sense, meaning that we're planning cool.
4155760	4163654	506	B	0.99944	Well, I encourage people to check out the course website and submit questions that they'd like to see addressed by Chris.
4163702	4167494	507	B	0.99996	Also to register and join these participatory discussions.
4167542	4185714	508	B	0.91875	There'll be three more of them, so if you want to join, share your QRF, be part of the public of all of these works that we'll compile at the end and just get your exoskeleton in the game with what is happening here.
4185752	4191460	509	B	0.50538	It'd be really awesome to hear more voices and to have more on board.
4192310	4196180	510	B	0.7192	Okay, thank you, Dean, and Ander till next time.
4196550	4196830	511	A	0.68135	Bye.
