00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,294
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:07,412 --> 00:00:21,386
It's July 29, 2023, and we're here in session three discussion of the course physics's Information Processing at the Active Inference Institute.

3
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:32,098
We're having a follow up discussion on Chris Fields's third lecture on quantum reference frames, and we're looking forward to your participation.

4
00:00:32,274 --> 00:00:37,942
So if you're watching along live and you've been invited to the calendar event, it's not too late to jump in.

5
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:45,686
If you're watching on YouTube, you can write any questions or comments in the live chat with Dean and Ander here.

6
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:57,594
We're going to be looking at some of the key points and taking it in a few different directions, sharing our reference frames, making a shared one.

7
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:14,114
So, Ander, would be awesome to have you Zoom in a little bit on the slide and then feel free to take us through some of the key points so that we can see a little bit how you're seeing it.

8
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:14,900
Thank you.

9
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,754
That looks good.

10
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:17,540
Yes.

11
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:26,882
Okay, so let's start by reviewing the last lecture from a couple of weeks ago, and then we can open up the discussions.

12
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:30,520
If there's any questions that appear in the live chat, we can address those.

13
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,802
All right.

14
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:55,398
So lecture 2, Chris introduced this idea of the information processing between systems A and B, where they interact via qubits on a boundary, and they have reference frames that give meaning to this communication.

15
00:01:55,594 --> 00:02:05,380
You want to think of information processing as a communication channel, the way Shannon thought about it.

16
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
So that was in lecture 2.

17
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:20,246
And lecture 3, a couple weeks ago, tried to make this more explicit by emphasizing the idea that this has to be physically embodied somewhere.

18
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:20,874
Okay.

19
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:44,990
And I think that because we are so used to information being fungible in no small part because of the Internet and everything, it's a little hard to understand at first when the claim is made that you have a QRF that is not fungible or you have a piece of quantum information that's nonfungible or things like the no-Cloning theorem.

20
00:02:45,590 --> 00:03:00,550
We're so used to information being fungible, to "it" being zeros and ones, that it's a bit of a change in mindset at first, but that's exactly what lecture 3 introduced.

21
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,640
This was old stuff, right?

22
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,198
Could you maybe just unpack that a little bit?

23
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:09,522
What would it mean for information to be fungible?

24
00:03:09,586 --> 00:03:11,350
Or what's that stance like?

25
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,182
And then, what does it mean for information to be nonfungible?

26
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:16,060
And what is that stance like?

27
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,578
Yeah, I'm out to get there.

28
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:23,854
So let me scroll down the slides, because that's addressed here.

29
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:31,886
So maybe I should have kept this in the beginning, but anyways, session 2 talked about how information theory makes this simple and obvious.

30
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:32,640
Okay.

31
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:40,980
And in session 3, we talk about reference frames and mechanistically, how all of this works.

32
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:50,022
So, yeah, let's address that question of the difference between... hold on 1 second.

33
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:53,320
Let me use my mouse to scroll down here.

34
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,346
Okay, so that's a little faster.

35
00:03:57,378 --> 00:03:57,960
Right.

36
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,120
Okay.

37
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,118
Can you restate your question, Daniel?

38
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:04,474
Yeah.

39
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:08,970
What would it mean for information to be fungible or nonfungible?

40
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:17,390
People might be familiar with that in the economic setting with nonfungible tokens and all of that, but what are we talking about with informational fungibility?

41
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,266
I think it basically comes down to whether you can replicate.

42
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:27,490
I mean, it's basically the difference between classical and quantum information.

43
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:35,460
As far as I know, fungible information is everything that you can basically turn into a message of zeros and ones.

44
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,038
How you transmit it may be different, the channel, the physical hardware and so on.

45
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:51,738
But at the end of the day, it's something that you can write on a boundary and something that you can transmit at zeros and ones.

46
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:59,350
Whereas quantum information, you literally have to send the hardware, the piece of hardware, the QRF.

47
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,402
At least that's how I understand it.

48
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:11,114
So a simple answer might be that it's information encoded in a piece of software versus a piece of hardware.

49
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:14,000
But I don't think that analogy is perfect.

50
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,114
Yeah.

51
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:17,300
Dean, what do you think?

52
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,754
Here's what I'm curious about.

53
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:23,602
And again, you guys can help me with this.

54
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:30,126
As opposed to reference frames, I oftentimes default to frame of reference.

55
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:37,794
And I know that in one of the live streams, what I tried to bring out was the idea that there was an ice cream cone looking at an ice cream truck.

56
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:46,262
And the question was always whether or not which one of those two entities, one is in the foreground and one is in the background.

57
00:05:46,326 --> 00:06:09,150
And in this slide that Ander has up the question is, is the nonfungibility because only A and B can decide whether the VA as seen by B, the A is deeper into that image based on our frame of reference.

58
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:16,878
And the B is closer or is the B the one that's actually deeper and the A is the one that's in the foreground?

59
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:32,060
And I was wondering whether the idea of noncopyability is because of that depth of field aspect that cannot be determined unless it's literally handed over the way that Chris was describing it.

60
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:51,840
I think that's basically accurate. I'm not sure that I can answer your question, but I think I have the feeling that Chris well, Chris said this in the lecture, that at the end of the day, the QRF is somewhere in your nervous system.

61
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,858
And here, you bring up a good point.

62
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:57,170
Right.

63
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,070
It looks like this slide is a bit of an optical illusion.

64
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:07,800
Whether you see A or B deeper, I guess it depends on something going on inside your head.

65
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,310
This picture is so symmetrical that if you focus enough on it, you can change your opinion.

66
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,010
Just to even connect that to what we're talking about.

67
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:33,306
The classical fungible information on the Holographic screen, on the blanket, and then the quantum cognitive rotation, is those two images are on the screen, identical.

68
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:52,094
And then whether it gets a quantum rotation such that the three points of the axes are closer to us than the intersection on that kind of tetrahedron or the other way around, whether the ballerina is rotating one way or the other, that's not on the boundary.

69
00:07:52,222 --> 00:08:03,190
So the information about the depth of field is part of the QRF or part of the enactment of the QRF, and it's not written on the boundary.

70
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,100
And that goes back to the preparation question and not just the measuring.

71
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,140
Yeah.

72
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:36,110
Like if the preparation...if your whole enculturation or the last five minutes, it was entrained, or you were holding an object, that predisposed you to think that the vertex of the intersection was further away, that's the preparation that sets your prior so that when you get this ambiguous artifact, you rotate it into the most natural position, cognitively, and that's the preparation that sets you up for a measurement.

73
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:43,200
No measurement can happen without a preparation.

74
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,520
What do you think, Ander?

75
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,970
Sure.

76
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,204
Yeah.

77
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:50,630
Everything you said makes sense.

78
00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:10,570
So perhaps let me recall, what was that, around the slides, it was in this whole spirit or philosophy of making, emphasizing that information is physical, it concubit [?] this whole thing.

79
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:38,800
One of the glaring omissions in physics was the embodiment of the reference frame, which was treated as an abstraction in classical physics, such as by Galileo, but maybe even Einstein, even if he, my hunch, is that he did have more of this instinct,  particularly in all those thought experiments of trying to chase the light ray.

80
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,732
You are chasing the light ray.

81
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:40,976
Right.

82
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:50,740
I mean, this is the whole process of making the observer and the reference frame more and more explicit and more and more physical.

83
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,850
Because at the end of the day, it has to right.

84
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:16,990
If you start with this assumption, that solipsistic assumption almost, that all you see is part of the same material ether that you are, then you are part of the universe and you're observing something that is out there.

85
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,224
So you need to include a theory of what it means for you to be observing that.

86
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:22,608
Right.

87
00:10:22,694 --> 00:10:25,724
And at the end of the day, the observer has to be physical.

88
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:30,256
That's what was emphasized by Chris at the beginning of this lecture.

89
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:50,456
So this jump from treating the reference frame as an abstraction to a real physical entity...these people have talked a lot about in these papers that are quoted there [2007, Reference Frames, Superselection Rules, and Quantum Information, Bartlett SD, Rudolph T, Spekkers, RW].

90
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:57,624
But I should also remark, if folks want to see this, it's coming up in high energy theory.

91
00:10:57,672 --> 00:11:06,856
Also in recent work of Susskind [Leonard Susskind] and others, where they talk about quantum reference frames very explicitly.

92
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:21,940
So I don't have the citations at the bottom, but it's definitely becoming an important thing in the last 20 years, this attempt to really explicitly treat the reference frame and the observer as a quantum entity, as a physical entity.

93
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:34,330
Okay, so that's what I just said the jump from treating things reference frames as abstractions to physical objects.

94
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:48,940
And because we cannot make a perfect copy of quantum information, we say that these are unique and nonclonable and nonfungible.

95
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,184
So in order to recreate an experiment perfectly, this is addressed as a part of fungibility or not.

96
00:11:59,222 --> 00:11:59,664
Right.

97
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:14,150
Can Alice, if you have some sort of quantum experiment and Alice and Bob are, you know, it's the usual DPR [?] thought experiment or whatever, Alice and Bob are separated by light years.

98
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,850
Is it enough, if they want to recreate the same, exact same experiment for Alice to send a string of zeros and ones?

99
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:31,176
Well, if you had an experiment where that's enough, then you can recreate it with fungible information.

100
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:38,860
If not, then you need to somehow send nonfungible information, which really implies sending a piece of hardware.

101
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:49,150
Can I add another piece here on the previous slide?

102
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:57,562
So this looks really technical and scientific, but let's think about Alice's laboratory; is Alice's brain, mind and Bob's analogously?

103
00:13:02,378 --> 00:13:06,370
Alice is thinking about what to say and then says it.

104
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,402
And that information might be written in a chat form.

105
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:15,350
It might be said verbally, it might be transmitted through digital or analog signal.

106
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,986
But at some point it's going through this classical informational interface.

107
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:24,182
And then Bob's laboratory is like perceiving and unpacking it.

108
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:37,334
And the question of semantic alignment is such that if Alice gives a shopping list of ten items, if there's semantic alignment, Bob would be able to go to the store and then find those ten items.

109
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:42,558
And it made me think of the dictionary definition of left and right.

110
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:49,390
So this gets back to our discussion of whether the vertex on these axes is coming towards us or away from us.

111
00:13:49,460 --> 00:14:02,158
So I looked up the dictionary definition of left: "on, toward, or relating to the side of a human body or of a thing that is to the west when the person or that thing is facing north."

112
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:06,630
So that's, I guess, one attempt to anchor what it means to be left.

113
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,194
The second definition is the left hand part side or direction.

114
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:13,270
And you could imagine there's an analogous definition for right.

115
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:26,890
The point is you can't describe verbally leftness and rightness or chirality in general because its reference is an embodied perspective.

116
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:43,010
And so if Alice said, okay, you're going to go down the street and then turn left at the stop sign, how would Alice communicate to Bob what leftness meant at that stop sign versus rightness?

117
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,250
And that's this question of flipping.

118
00:14:47,670 --> 00:15:09,658
And the way that the quantum formalism accommodates that is through the Wick rotation and the quantum cognitive event where the fungible transmittable holographic information gets rotated into the imaginary axis with the formalisms that enable it to be rotated at all.

119
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:13,500
But that means you could rotate it "left" or rotate it right.

120
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,962
Yeah, I think that's a very good explanation.

121
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:21,854
I don't know if I have much to add.

122
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:23,440
Dean you wanted to say.

123
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,074
I can't.

124
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:57,830
I don't know the answer to this, but to take what Daniel just said, to take the basic concept of being able to take something that, for all intents and purposes, can appear one way or another and then turn that into how Chris closed the last lecture with we are seeing ourselves as both being entangled and also being separatable.

125
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:09,834
How did we go literally from a three dimension vertex to we're both entangled and we're not living in a paradox.

126
00:16:09,962 --> 00:16:11,742
That's just the way it is.

127
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:18,174
We're also removing ourselves or separating ourselves at the same time.

128
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:28,530
That's what I would like to know, because somewhere between three arbitrary lines and complexity is not a paradox.

129
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,760
Something has to be happening, and I'm not exactly sure how that transition plays out.

130
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,230
Anybody want to enlighten me?

131
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,172
Can you repeat your question, please?

132
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:57,170
Well, how do we go at this point of the reference frame description of saying, you can't copy it, all you can do is pass it?

133
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:08,180
Because we think things could be flipped based on internal reference frames, internal meanings and internal models.

134
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,064
The thing we choose for context.

135
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:42,908
Yada yada yada yada goes all the way out to the conclusion of Chris's conversation with us in number 3, where he said, bottom line is that it's not a paradox that as things become more and more complex, then it wants to get to a place of entanglement, alignment, a sense of agreement, and at the same time wants to remain separate.

136
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:47,890
So between those two things, a whole lot has happened.

137
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:56,384
And I don't think we've skipped over it, but we certainly haven't opened it up and really looked at it closely.

138
00:17:56,432 --> 00:18:00,820
And I'm just curious what's in between those two scales.

139
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,812
I agree.

140
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:08,536
I think we're going to cover that towards the end of the talk, but I agree.

141
00:18:08,718 --> 00:18:27,356
I don't know how you see this related to QRFs or the stuff we just talked about, but I think it's the big question in this lecture, right, that was like, where does this tension between increasing complexity and wanting to predict what the environment is doing?

142
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:41,296
One requires entanglement and the other one requires separability, at least colloquially speaking, I think this tension is basically what the free energy principle comes down to.

143
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:41,456
Right.

144
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:42,770
Daniel, what do you think?

145
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,060
You have the free energy and you have the E minus tS.

146
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,864
One is prediction error.

147
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:50,816
I mean, not exactly E minus tS.

148
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:50,996
Right?

149
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:53,456
That would be thermodynamics but you know what I mean.

150
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:58,250
One is prediction error and the other one is what was?

151
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,650
I can remember.

152
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:12,604
I'll definitely look forward to the technical unpacking that you'll get to soon, but I was reminded of the William Blake quotation, "do what you will, this life's a fiction and is made up of contradiction."

153
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:25,600
So let's modify that: "project what you will, rotate what you will, spacetime's a fiction."

154
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:37,232
Not that it's false, but that it's a projected fictionalization that it doesn't have the ontological primacy that the topology of communication does and is made up of contradiction.

155
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:37,780
Yes.

156
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:53,112
And it's made up of this tension between fitting and not overfitting, between aligning and the principle of unitarity and differentiating and becoming through others, we become ourselves and that type of articulation and recognizing that two complementary forces like convex and concave come into existence at once.

157
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:13,440
Like a zero to two jump is not an issue or a stumbling block.

158
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,170
It's that we wouldn't have it any other way.

159
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,210
Couldn't have it any other way.

160
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,016
Yeah, sure, we'll get that.

161
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:27,584
Towards the end, you can almost even call it a duality.

162
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:29,728
It's not far fetched.

163
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:33,788
I mean, it's the sort of thing that I think most people will be happy to take for granted.

164
00:20:33,824 --> 00:20:41,912
Such supersymmetry like you have two kinds of particles, but the same amount of them, and dualities that are all over the place.

165
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:56,600
So I think it's not unreasonable to just accept that there is a tension between increasing complexity, which you want A and B to be separable for, and accuracy prediction.

166
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:08,556
Now, how this is related to emergent space and these QRFs stuff, I don't want to make very far fetched claims.

167
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:11,190
We'll talk about emergent space later on the course.

168
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:19,190
But for now, let's say a few more words about QRFs and then we'll get to the complexity stuff towards the end.

169
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:42,684
QRFs are almost building blocks, if you want, for information processing. Here, it's very useful to recall the definition that I feel, I think, we have mentioned before, of information as being differences that make a difference.

170
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:47,772
That's probably the best colloquial definition of information I've heard.

171
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:50,224
And I think it does a lot of work.

172
00:21:50,262 --> 00:21:55,216
I mean, it's almost mathematical, but anyways, we need to unpack it a little more and see.

173
00:21:55,318 --> 00:22:01,424
So for a difference to make a difference, what do you want out of QRF?

174
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,070
Right.

175
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,470
Unsurprisingly, I mean, not surprisingly, but reassuringly, I think would be the word.

176
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:20,168
You need a QRF to have sensory, action and a default state, right?

177
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:26,336
This is sort of like where your Bayesian prior distribution is encoded.

178
00:22:26,468 --> 00:22:32,312
These three things will give you a building block for any information processing.

179
00:22:32,456 --> 00:22:44,240
And that ties together with all the work in the free energy literature and perception-action loops and whatnot.

180
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:53,216
So before we see mathematically how a QRF is defined, I think it's more illustrative.

181
00:22:53,248 --> 00:23:03,444
And I think Chris went exactly on the right order when he presented this a couple weeks ago, seeing examples from each.

182
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:11,960
These are actual pieces of hardware that are effectively QRFs, and it's remarkable how they map to...well, I'll skip ahead a little bit.

183
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:29,256
But when you get to the mathematical definition of a QRF as a quantum system that you can specify with this category theory diagram, you have incoming arrows into a node that then expands.

184
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:29,484
Right?

185
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:38,684
And this roughly corresponds to measurement and preparation degrees of, not degrees of freedom, degrees of freedom would be the same, right, when you attach it to the boundary.

186
00:23:38,812 --> 00:23:42,870
But measurement and preparation stages, I guess, would be the better word.

187
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,500
But anyways, let me go back to these examples, right?

188
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:53,448
And Daniel, you're the biologist here, so correct me if I say anything wrong here.

189
00:23:53,534 --> 00:24:03,144
You have a cartoon picture of a bacteria, I think, and this is a very simple sort of thing, right?

190
00:24:03,182 --> 00:24:09,790
It navigates in the direction of food and that's it, right?

191
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,600
So it is a very simple rudimentary example of a cureb.

192
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:23,324
You have the sensory stage here, I guess the degrees of freedom.

193
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,490
It's not obvious here what the boundary is, that's one thing.

194
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:41,716
But it is a good enough picture to see the resemblance to here we have the measurement which in this case you're trying to measure concentration of food.

195
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:52,490
You have your node here, C, which is your prior distribution for concentration of food.

196
00:24:52,860 --> 00:25:04,604
And finally you have the output, the preparation stage, which is the rest of this chemical network that will control and steer this bacteria, right?

197
00:25:04,642 --> 00:25:13,730
So here you want to call it the action degrees of freedom that will steer this bacteria in the direction of food.

198
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:19,840
And likewise with cell division, this I understand even less that the network appears more complicated.

199
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:36,920
But I think it's fair to say that at the end of the day, all these chemical networks that appear super complicated somehow have to be mapped to this category theoretical diagram.

200
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,048
That's all there is to it.

201
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:52,750
You're going to have the sensory input and the action output and you're going to have the default chemical concentration which amounts to this node over here.

202
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,304
You remember this from last lecture, right, Daniel?

203
00:25:59,432 --> 00:25:59,868
Yeah.

204
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:06,796
In the Cone-Cocone we explored also in the live stream 17 on the Bayesian semantic information flow.

205
00:26:06,908 --> 00:26:20,352
But I'll kind of add a point about these biological systems in relationship to artificially specified systems and what that helps us understand about perception, cognition, action.

206
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:39,272
So the cone Cone-Cocone diagram has this bow tie architecture or this kind of like two pyramids touching point to point where there's a preparation and a measurement which can be different dimensionalities or different scopes.

207
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:45,388
Like it could be multi-input, multi-output or multi-input, single output, vice versa and so on.

208
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:51,760
But they come through this eye of the needle with C prime here.

209
00:26:51,910 --> 00:27:03,350
Now, contrast that kind of architecture represented here abstractly, with what we see in the bacterial process and in the cell division process.

210
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:16,680
These have that kind of a bow tie perception, cognition, action architecture or measurement, cognitive integration, preparation architecture.

211
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:41,516
In contrast, we see, for example, an artificial neural network where the input and the output layers are usually lower dimensional, maybe an image coming in with several hundred pixels and a single output like a classifier coming out the other end, but a dimensional explosion in those internal cognitive layers.

212
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,204
But in biological systems, it's actually exactly the opposite.

213
00:27:46,588 --> 00:27:54,564
For example, many, many receptors on the cell surface, on the holographic boundary, the sensorium of the cell but then there are these common secondary messengers that many pathways converge upon.

214
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:33,040
So that reflects the kind of radically different architecture that a QRF embodies, as opposed to the approach taken by disembodied intelligence frameworks which use dimensional explosion internally to try to categorize and classify and find edge cases versus this dimensional winnowing that is reflective of these embodied intelligences.

215
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:53,624
And if I may make a tangential comment here also, I think the good thing about these two examples is that they also showcase the fact of how the deep implications of scale -ree biology, if you want to call it this way.

216
00:28:53,662 --> 00:29:06,596
We tend to think of these sorts of processes, such as here, only happening at the level of the nervous system in animals, or as you said, neural networks.

217
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:06,872
Right.

218
00:29:06,926 --> 00:29:09,420
We tend to associate this with neural networks.

219
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:16,988
And perhaps evolution has tiered us in a way that endowed us with nervous systems to make these things.

220
00:29:17,074 --> 00:29:24,720
Maybe these are higher up in the layers, but really that's a bit of an arbitrary distinction that we make.

221
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:31,350
The processes going on at the cellular level, even if they don't appear to have anything to do with nervous system, my understanding is that there are some generic properties that are the same and everything that has to do with information processing. It manifests maybe slightly different when it comes to explicit neurons, but at the end of the day, it's the same generic process going on.

222
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:52,936
Would you say?

223
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,360
That's right, Daniel?

224
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:08,540
The ontological claim is that it's the same generic process happening, whereas the more instrumentalist claim is that we can model it with some shared abstractions.

225
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,064
Yeah.

226
00:30:12,182 --> 00:30:14,128
Okay, so we can continue.

227
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:14,850
Right?

228
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:24,004
I don't have a whole lot to say. Daniel said quite a bit. At the end of the day, QRF, you can visualize it as this diagram, and you can think of it, if you are more familiar with the picture of a neural network, and ways on a neural network and so on.

229
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,210
That's the way to think about it.

230
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,776
Now, let's continue with explicit embodiment, if you wish.

231
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:58,460
So QRFs in the formalism have to be attached to a boundary; boundary degrees of freedom.

232
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:14,820
And I should add another remark here, and personally to me also, the hard part about this quantum free energy principle formalism, if you wish, is what you said at the beginning is the fact that it's topological, right?

233
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,196
So very often it's not clear what the boundary degrees of freedom are.

234
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:18,772
Right?

235
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:28,520
Because we tend to think of boundaries as geometrical and certainly the classical FEP treats them as geometrical.

236
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:39,180
But that's not the case here in the quantum free energy formalism where we have emergent space will be talked about in later sessions.

237
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:56,400
But that's just like one quick remark to make at the end of the day, though, even if it's topological, we're going to have real degrees of freedom that this QRF is attaching to this Cone-Cocone diagram.

238
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:05,670
And you're going to have measurement operators that yield classical outcomes plus and minus one.

239
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:26,780
And then you can think of this QRF or more abstractly, this Cone-Cocone diagram as a neural network, if it was acting on those under qubits and then back propagating some sort of action signal preparation.

240
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:44,000
Okay, let's not forget that Landauer's principle and so on requires that we are mindful of energy constraints on computation.

241
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,320
And that gives us the following picture.

242
00:32:51,960 --> 00:33:03,868
Number 1-we're going to have to use energy from the environment to fuel our computation, to fuel our observation.

243
00:33:04,064 --> 00:33:10,090
That means that right away you cannot use the entirety of your boundary to gather information.

244
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,192
It necessitates an allocation of resources.

245
00:33:16,276 --> 00:33:33,376
Right, here, E is the observed environment, and the blue portion is A [the figure shows 'B'], the thermodynamical sector where you extract free energy and dump heat in order to run this computational process.

246
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:41,220
And then furthermore, you can have a memory sector where you write things on a boundary, and this takes up energy.

247
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:46,150
Also, writing information onto the boundary by Landauer's Principle will take up information.

248
00:33:47,720 --> 00:34:06,540
And Chris called this the minimally interested observer because it has a memory sector, and quite minimal here implies that we have at least minimal interest implies that we have more than one layer.

249
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:17,820
Here, the process of writing things onto a memory sector requires us to have a clock so that we can label those memories in time.

250
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:22,290
Okay, so we do have time as part of this formalism, just not space yet.

251
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,960
Time has to be internal to the observer.

252
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,470
Just one piece on that, that Chris mentioned.

253
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:51,370
And as you echoed, time here is an attribute of "some" cognitive systems in terms of their "internal" understanding so that they can sort memories and understand what came earlier or later.

254
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:59,516
It's not something that's a priori defined externally, which is the case in the kind of spacetime first, now, how do we fit communication into here?

255
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:13,996
We flip that. We're talking about the topology of communication as ontologically, primal and now, certain kinds of sophisticated agents.

256
00:35:14,098 --> 00:35:27,940
This is not like necessarily true of a rock or a metronome or a particle of a gas, but some kinds of cognitive systems are such that they are able to generate an internal clock concept.

257
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:33,244
And that doesn't have to be the same thing as what's happening on the wall with Kronos.

258
00:35:33,312 --> 00:35:40,356
This can reflect a purely internal time Kairos that enables observers or interactors that have different clock structures.

259
00:35:40,468 --> 00:35:50,072
And then Landauer's principle helps us arbitrage or connect the informational demands to the energetic or the metabolic demands.

260
00:35:50,136 --> 00:36:08,560
Dean so when I first listened to the lecture, I thought when the term or phrase trade-off was raised, I traditionally have thought of trade-off as kind of a binary.

261
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:15,956
If I'm picking this, I'm trading-off against all the other things that I didn't pick.

262
00:36:16,138 --> 00:36:20,240
So one or the other or others plural.

263
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:34,948
But when I saw this, and especially when I heard it in the context of things like degrees of freedom, I began to wonder whether it is because it could sit on either side of that boundary.

264
00:36:34,964 --> 00:36:50,624
It could be a priori or it could be ad hoc or post hoc, a trade-off which prior to this conversation, I just assumed that a trade-off was one or the other.

265
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:54,450
But essentially what this implies is still a kind of a degree of how much weight you put into it and then you kind of cross a threshold and then you've made your pick, you've completed your trade-off.

266
00:37:10,138 --> 00:37:16,084
Or again, did I misinterpret what I was hearing?

267
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:32,030
If it's topological as opposed to the more conventional spacetime perspective, can a trade-off be both ad hoc and post hoc, seemingly at the same time?

268
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,410
Very interesting question.

269
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,670
Let us just let it float and continue on, enter.

270
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,076
All right.

271
00:37:45,258 --> 00:37:49,270
Because again, I'll just say this.

272
00:37:49,720 --> 00:38:04,170
If it can be, that would really move us out of the classical realm that would essentially say that anytime we've made a pick, we really haven't made a pick.

273
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:17,592
There's still a whole bunch of other things that are going to happen that can change whatever that action is that we thought we carried out or enacted.

274
00:38:17,736 --> 00:38:29,680
If we're talking about an internality state, which is what I think we want, I think we want to be able to change our minds.

275
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,772
Let me take that one way, Dean.

276
00:38:37,000 --> 00:39:07,176
The analytical equations of the action-perception loop don't tell us in implementation--like if we're going to write it in code--whether we should use action first, procedurally, to update our observations, or whether we enable our observations to wag the dog and then select action at the end of the loop.

277
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:10,892
So is it a perception-action loop or is it an action-perception loop?

278
00:39:11,036 --> 00:39:34,720
And those enable a kind of seesaw where sometimes we want what we learn to change what we do and other times we want what we do to change what we learn, and having that kind of a fulcrum or a pivot, and again, to connect it to the vertex popping in and out.

279
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:43,560
The analytical formalisms inscribed on the screen of the FEP, like the textbooks--they're ambiguous.

280
00:39:44,060 --> 00:40:18,704
Whether we lead with action and have inference follow, or whether we lead with inference and have action follow, or lead with action, have inference follow--whichever one of the combinations there are--and then that trade-off or runoff is broken by specific embodied cognitive agents, that trade-off about the procedural primacy of perception or action can't be broken.

281
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:20,950
Generically. Right.

282
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,360
MMM.

283
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,650
It certainly makes for a lot of waste heat if you're not careful.

284
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,220
It'd be exhausting a lot anyway.

285
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:42,840
Okay.

286
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:54,342
I don't know if we can talk about intent much with this formalism, but, we can take a very descriptive approach to it...and go down here a little more actually, before, I don't want to get ahead of myself.

287
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:33,300
What I mean by that is whether we can put intent or not in this hierarchy, I don't know if it matters a whole lot, but at least we can talk about it operationally and descriptively and say just like when you have a clock, the clock is just there, right?

288
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,086
If you don't have the clock, you don't have the memory and that's it, right?

289
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:52,540
And likewise here, if we don't have an attention control compartment, we cannot play with all these QRFs that are noncommutative at the same time.

290
00:41:52,910 --> 00:42:01,514
So if there is no attention control system to begin with, we cannot talk about a system that has noncommutative QRFs.

291
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:07,120
Meaning here, one presumably goes to memory sectors, the other one goes to environment sectors and so on.

292
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:28,650
So this is certainly a necessity of the fact that we have different sectors of the boundary being allocated to different purposes, such as environmental observation and memory and so on. Within the environment, it's worth remarking that here, if you think deeply about first principles and what it means to observe an entity, well, you still come down to these differences that make a difference sort of thing.

293
00:42:44,676 --> 00:42:45,182
Right.

294
00:42:45,316 --> 00:42:58,494
Which involves whenever you're looking at the environment, if you're going to identify a system, you need sort of a background that puts the system in context.

295
00:42:58,542 --> 00:42:58,802
Right.

296
00:42:58,856 --> 00:43:01,994
So that you can identify the system as something distinct.

297
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:31,534
I think this, again, is something that we have talked about in previous discussions, where the easiest picture here is something like the speed gauge in your car, where P is the gauge itself that tells you the speed, but it's meaningless without the reference system right, outside of the thing that stays invariant, right?

298
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:37,070
The context, the background, that gauge moving means nothing to you.

299
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:53,510
So we come back to this idea of if we think of information as differences that make a difference in terms of first principles, this environment sector that we saw earlier has to be further broken down into pointer and reference states.

300
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:59,762
Again, this is covered in depth in Chris's papers.

301
00:43:59,906 --> 00:44:04,790
I'm thinking particularly of "Free Energy for Generating Quantum Systems."

302
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:25,390
And again, just to reiterate this attention-control-staff compartment, which is, by the way, very reminiscent to the hierarchy that was earlier, with the clock arising higher up in the hierarchy, deeper into the layer.

303
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:32,298
Likewise, whenever you're writing something into an [inaudible], you need to have that clock.

304
00:44:32,394 --> 00:44:40,174
Whenever you are deploying noncommunicated QRFs, you're going to need an attention-control compartment.

305
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,950
And we just described this operationally.

306
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:51,030
If you didn't have it, then the agent would not be what it is; it could not deploy those noncommutative QRFs.

307
00:44:52,810 --> 00:45:02,460
So, marching on, we'll just end here with QRF alignment and the free energy principle.

308
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,304
Just a few more words.

309
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:28,516
This is possibly the most interesting picture in this presentation and just we can recall here the possibilities for QRF alignment and how free energy comes into play. In this formalism, we call (a) the trivial interaction.

310
00:45:28,548 --> 00:45:31,240
We call this a thermal interaction.

311
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,604
And then you have a bunch of possibilities, right?

312
00:45:34,642 --> 00:45:46,160
And depending on each possibility, you're going to see things as noise or as in the paper says, nonlocal hidden variables.

313
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:57,040
The last situation is what we call alignment when we have QRFs of the same size, perfectly aligned.

314
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:12,806
Recall, I think this would be the situation where you have noiseless classical computation, right?

315
00:46:12,908 --> 00:46:15,270
You have A and B just interacting.

316
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:28,582
And also this is the situation where, correct me if I'm wrong, Daniel, this is entanglement, right?

317
00:46:28,636 --> 00:46:39,130
Asymptotically once all the curves are aligned, you have entanglement and now we can tie it back maybe to Dean's earlier.

318
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:44,560
So these two slides conclude the discussion basically and then we can open it up.

319
00:46:45,570 --> 00:47:06,230
So given these possibilities for how QRFs can be aligned, QRFs deployed by [inaudible] can be aligned, and how in each situation you're going to get noise or whatever, then what does the free energy principle say in this quantum setting?

320
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:14,230
Well, minimizing variational, free energy leads you to entanglements.

321
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:28,170
So if theorem here, if you are in the picture of (d) here and the QRFs are aligned, A and B are going to be entangled.

322
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:50,400
Now, there is a tension between this tendency towards alignment as free energy principle will carry you, and observe reality, which is that we're not just a blob of entangled particles.

323
00:47:50,480 --> 00:48:05,850
There is separability and systems are attention between maintaining separability and at the same time being correlated enough to the environment so as to be able to predict it.

324
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,700
And now we can maybe go into a more philosophical discussion about the free energy principle.

325
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:32,820
I should also say in the last month, just like I talked earlier, QRFs, Lenny Susskind, whose recent paper that talks about QRF led me into a rabbit hole when looking into his recent work and he's talked a lot about complexity.

326
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:41,872
I'm being very speculative here, so if someone can call me out, that would be good in the comments.

327
00:48:42,016 --> 00:48:57,608
But just skimming through some of his papers, I saw a monograph in 2018 where he talks about complexity and he puts forward this second law for complexity in quantum systems and increased complexity [2018, Second law of quantum complexity, AR Brown and L Susskind], and it is very reminiscent of what's going on here.

328
00:49:00,786 --> 00:49:20,960
You have a tension between systems tending to entanglement, and on the other side of the free energy functional, if you wish, where systems increase in complexity and that necessarily requires that A and B are separate.

329
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,550
So Daniel, do you have any comments at this point?

330
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,404
Yeah, there's a lot to it.

331
00:49:28,602 --> 00:49:39,524
I like that you showed the four possibilities in the image above and said it was one of the most interesting figures.

332
00:49:39,652 --> 00:49:42,330
I agree.

333
00:49:42,940 --> 00:50:12,560
And how to connect this to the classical FEP and also how to see the quantum FEP not as just a second story built on top of the classical FEP which would be kind of like a historical chronological understanding of the theoretical apparatus.

334
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:24,012
But it's almost like the quantum FEP was like a basement we didn't know about because it gives a broader context.

335
00:50:24,096 --> 00:50:37,900
And though it appeared conceptually several years later in the timeline we understand that doesn't give it a secondary status.

336
00:50:38,800 --> 00:51:03,090
So what it really means for the classical FEP to be kind of like a special case of this actually more generic setting there's just a lot I'm very...

337
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,796
I can wrap it up and then if Dean or you want to say something, we can continue with that.

338
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:24,532
But let me conclude and this is all I have to say for mean, I'm sure Chris will explain this more in coming sessions and lectures.

339
00:51:24,596 --> 00:51:30,350
But I think the main key differences is in the emergence of space.

340
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:36,300
How it might emerge from something more fundamental, maybe a tensor network or who knows?

341
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,384
But that's the big difference, right?

342
00:51:40,502 --> 00:51:48,560
And I suppose the quantum free energy principle generalizes the classical free energy principle because it doesn't have this spatial embedding.

343
00:51:48,900 --> 00:52:02,052
Now, this, to me personally and also to folks in the audience for asking questions is probably the hardest part to wrap your head around.

344
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:11,290
And I foresee interest in those discussions and lectures that deal with the concept of emergent space.

345
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:25,656
Because every time you try to and I've done this myself I've been thinking about how you could apply this formalism to better known pictures or compared it, for instance, with thermal equilibrium, with relaxation, with thermal equilibrium.

346
00:52:25,688 --> 00:52:28,664
And then you start thinking about, okay, what is the boundary and so on.

347
00:52:28,802 --> 00:52:30,144
It's far from obvious, right?

348
00:52:30,182 --> 00:52:35,356
Because, again, you have to remind yourself that the definition is topological.

349
00:52:35,548 --> 00:52:48,790
So in that regard, I think it might be worth talking about one of the questions that came up that I thought was good and then I can call it a day on this end.

350
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,156
So this question and I think it was the first question asked since the last lecture.

351
00:52:55,338 --> 00:53:00,664
Can you just read the full question and then read the full answer?

352
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:01,448
Thank you.

353
00:53:01,614 --> 00:53:03,352
The answer, it's number 28 here.

354
00:53:03,406 --> 00:53:04,184
Can you guys see it?

355
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,848
Should I zoom in it a little bit?

356
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:08,908
It's pretty small, but reading it will be good.

357
00:53:09,074 --> 00:53:09,452
Okay.

358
00:53:09,506 --> 00:53:17,564
So this question I think I've asked myself this question too, maybe in a different way.

359
00:53:17,602 --> 00:53:21,330
But basically it gets to the point of what I was saying earlier, right?

360
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:36,288
That it would be nice to see how we can use this quantum free energy principle formalism to recover maybe familiar settings such as relaxation to thermal equilibrium via the heat equation.

361
00:53:36,384 --> 00:53:40,550
But that's far from obvious how you do it if your definition is topological, right?

362
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:46,840
So the question says, "what happens when the agent becomes identical to the environment when the model has been improved so much that it does not differ from the environment."

363
00:53:51,316 --> 00:53:52,632
"Is this a state even possible?"

364
00:53:52,686 --> 00:53:57,060
"Would it be thermodynamical-equilibrium-maximum entanglement?"

365
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:17,904
Okay, so clearly it's not thermodynamical equilibrium, but I think what the person is asking is maybe if I'm understanding this correctly, they're wondering, okay, so if the free energy principle drives A and B towards entanglement, then it's fair to say that any distinction between them has dissolved, right?

366
00:54:17,942 --> 00:54:19,890
That they have merged into the same thing.

367
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:31,460
That has to do with this whole definition of philosophical debate of thingness that Karl Friston is a proponent of, right?

368
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:34,380
What it means for two things to be separate.

369
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,770
Okay, so let's see what Chris said.

370
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:48,472
"Friston has pointed out that the limit of the classical FEP, the limit of perfect prediction, corresponds to generalized synchrony between system and environment."

371
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:52,380
"Each sends messages that the other can perfectly predict."

372
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,852
Now, however, it's clear I'm not reading anymore.

373
00:54:58,936 --> 00:55:00,992
I'm making a quick remark here.

374
00:55:01,046 --> 00:55:02,544
I'll continue in a second.

375
00:55:02,742 --> 00:55:17,440
In the classical FEP, it's clear that A and B, even if they are in the perfect limit of the FEP, they remain different entities.

376
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:17,764
Right?

377
00:55:17,802 --> 00:55:27,876
Because you have that, if you wish, that extra layers of differentiation coming from their spatial embedding.

378
00:55:27,988 --> 00:55:28,600
Right?

379
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:37,812
In the classical FEP that is clear, that if they are getting synchronized, they have not lost their separate identities.

380
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:42,460
You can always say, well, this is the one that was to the left and this is the one that was to the right.

381
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:45,070
Pun intended with earlier discussion, right?

382
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:55,536
You have that extra resource for separating them, if you wish, by virtue of the special embedding, right?

383
00:55:55,558 --> 00:56:02,880
The special embedding is giving you this extra information that allows you to keep track of A and B separately.

384
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,212
So I'll continue.

385
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:08,816
"This notion depends on the system and its environment being separated and hence distinguished somehow."

386
00:56:09,008 --> 00:56:13,556
"In classical formulations, they are separated in ordinary 3D space, i.e.,they occupy different locations. So they are different because they occupy different locations."

387
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:18,360
Right.

388
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:23,832
But if you don't have that geometrical background, then how do you know that they're different, right?

389
00:56:23,966 --> 00:56:25,864
Okay, so I continue.

390
00:56:26,062 --> 00:56:30,232
"The quantum formulation is background free, meaning it assumes no spacetime embedding."

391
00:56:30,296 --> 00:56:36,830
"System and environment do not have different locations, even though they have different sets of degrees of freedom in the overall Hilbert space."

392
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,660
"Here the limit of the FEP is maximum entanglement."

393
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,252
"This does not mean that the system and its environment are identical."

394
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:46,656
They are different, and they have different degrees of freedom."

395
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:53,452
Okay, so this is just addresses the question I just posed.

396
00:56:53,596 --> 00:57:01,860
"It means that the joint state is not separable into a system S and environment E."

397
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,684
"Their joint states are no longer conditionally independent."

398
00:57:04,832 --> 00:57:17,160
"This is distinct from thermal equilibrium, which means that they have the same temperature while remaining separable and that their interaction can be characterized as the change of thermal fluctuations, i.e., noise."

399
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,876
So I guess this is a nice warm up for things that are to come.

400
00:57:22,978 --> 00:57:42,790
But I do think that this whole idea of emergent space is going to be possibly one of the most important in the course, and it's going to help the gap between the class and quantum formulations, for sure.

401
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,390
Dean, what's your take on this?

402
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:58,600
What I saw was that when you have that kind of alignment, that perfect alignment, that was one that was (d) in that diagram, right?

403
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:10,588
That was one state of a complex state that included an (a) and a (b) and a (c) and probably a whole bunch of other ways that yeah, right.

404
00:58:10,674 --> 00:58:19,012
So that one state where you've got this kind of entanglement isn't into perpetuity.

405
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:21,008
Like you don't get there and then stay there.

406
00:58:21,094 --> 00:58:37,540
And that's where, I think, the question of separability and complexity...it still works, because just because you've momentarily gotten to a place that we define here as (d) doesn't mean you stay there indefinitely.

407
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:43,140
You could be swapping around to (b) and (c) and (a) in the next instant.

408
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:48,730
So at least that holds the complexity piece up.

409
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,544
That moment for however long that moment is.

410
00:58:53,662 --> 00:58:57,420
Where XA and XB are aligned isn't permanent.

411
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,316
So it's not predictable in that sense.

412
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:02,460
Therefore it is complex.

413
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:10,690
I still don't know how we get, though, that the closer we get to agreement, the more complex things are.

414
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:20,940
Unless we're just talking about (d) in this array of (a)(b)(c) and (d) that goes back to that quantum reference frame.

415
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:33,924
I think, like I said, again, maybe I'm interpreting this wrong, but when I message pass the reason why, I have to literally give it over to the other person and let them have it.

416
00:59:33,962 --> 00:59:35,844
I can't have them copy.

417
00:59:35,892 --> 00:59:57,640
What I'm doing is, because there has to be. I guess that reinforces the separability piece of this as well. The fact that I can't give them a copy, that I can only give them the information, and then they've got to sort of unpack it in their own way of taking it off the boundary.

418
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,048
But again, I struggle with this.

419
01:00:02,214 --> 01:00:18,630
1: I'm guilty as charged, but what I'm trying to do is trying to come up with my own narrative, so that what Chris is saying makes sense to me, as opposed to make sense to the world, which is what Chris is trying to do.

420
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,540
I'll try with another speculative fiction.

421
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:30,712
So there's a screen between, let's just say, the stage and the audience or whatever.

422
01:00:30,766 --> 01:00:32,392
It's a holographic screen.

423
01:00:32,526 --> 01:00:37,790
And on each side of the screen, there's some embodied object.

424
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:48,072
1: So that means that it's a volume enclosing object because points and lines and planes are only abstractions.

425
01:00:48,136 --> 01:00:50,892
Every real physical object encloses volume.

426
01:00:51,036 --> 01:00:57,920
And now a light is going to be coming from behind each object facing the screen.

427
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:02,644
And that's this kind of cone that we're seeing from each side.

428
01:01:02,682 --> 01:01:05,348
It's like the shadow cast by the object.

429
01:01:05,514 --> 01:01:13,076
1: So if the object was a sphere, then it would be projecting down to a circle onto the screen.

430
01:01:13,258 --> 01:01:17,704
If the shape were a cube, it could be projecting down.

431
01:01:17,742 --> 01:01:28,920
And so where the light is positioned is the perspective that that cognitive entity is taking on its QRF.

432
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,604
1: Those lights could move.

433
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:33,420
So now we have the situation where the two spotlights are moving.

434
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:36,748
1: Maybe the shapes are staying the same, maybe they're changing too.

435
01:01:36,914 --> 01:01:57,620
And it's like two search lights scanning across this B oval and sometimes they are perfectly locked or there could be a situation where they're perfectly aligned or there could be situations where they're totally disjoint.

436
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:12,970
1: And each of those situations have different implications for what one entity sees when it looks at the screen.

437
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:21,404
Maybe like the shadow is the only part where you can see because the rest of it is too blinding or something like that.

438
01:02:21,602 --> 01:02:39,120
And so then if we're in case (a) here where maybe (b) doesn't have a projection or maybe (b)'s projection is totally somewhere else, then (a) is in this solipsistic I'm the active agent interacting within an inert world setting.

439
01:02:40,020 --> 01:03:00,520
1: And (d) is like potentially the computer engineer's classical dream or asymptote, which is like all the data going through the USB cable is just being perfectly noiselessly received.

440
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:06,200
And then we also get these (b) and (c) cases.

441
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:10,430
1: But (a) is kind of like the inner world.

442
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:19,096
(d) is like the perfect communication channel. Then to connect it just to Friston's concept of generalized synchrony, as we've talked about many times, generalized synchrony doesn't mean lockstep.

443
01:03:24,332 --> 01:03:32,420
Two agents could reduce their uncertainty about each other, not by doing the same thing at every time step, but for example, by turn-taking.

444
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:51,012
And I think that points the way to how we get reduction of variational free energy, reduction of prediction error, surprise and so on without, especially, spatial temporal enmeshment, but not necessarily even informational identity enmeshment, because you could have two things that through their alignment become actually differentiated and that could increase the mutual information between two metronomes,not just to have them going in the same direction, but to have them going in opposite directions.

445
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:11,730
The mutual information in those two settings is going to be high.

446
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:23,700
So it's not the case that generalized synchrony means that things are becoming blurred.

447
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:36,040
We could actually also have integrated information through increased articulation, not just decreased.

448
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:41,450
1: And then life finds a way or cognition finds a way on this trade-off frontier of, in our pursuit of unitarity, will we blur to unify or will we differentiate to unify?

449
01:04:55,588 --> 01:04:57,896
1: But those are the paths we have.

450
01:04:58,078 --> 01:05:00,960
We don't have the backwards ratchet.

451
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,290
Yeah, yeah, makes sense.

452
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,220
Any other latter slides, Ander?

453
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,030
No, that's it.

454
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:32,116
So Chris made a few more remarks at the end about language here, but he mentioned that he's going to talk more about this in the coming lecture.

455
01:05:32,148 --> 01:05:34,410
So we'll just leave it up to him.

456
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:39,494
Yeah.

457
01:05:39,692 --> 01:06:01,180
There could be some very powerful and interesting linguistic opportunities for updating our speaking to reflect what we are learning here.

458
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:53,580
I don't know what those necessarily are, whether it's a syntactic or a semantic thing, or whether it's a narrative thing, but how to actually reenter some of these formalisms into our focused understanding could just be immensely powerful, and we could have a lot of integrity between the natural language way that potentially we're already showing up for engagement, and some of these formalisms that get to first principles about interacting entities and boundary conditions and all of that.

459
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:57,950
1: Dean, any penultimate thoughts?

460
01:06:58,450 --> 01:06:59,454
Not really.

461
01:06:59,652 --> 01:07:15,806
1: I'm going to go back and listen to Chris's comments again about this common cause and the fine-tuning assumption and whether that's sort of metaphorically, a dialing-in or what he means exactly by the fine-tuning, in the context of this conversation today, what you just kind of said about are we dulling something here or are we sculpting something to make it more fittable?

462
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:36,860
I'm going to go now and go back and listen to what he talks about in terms of fine-tuning and maybe update my priors around that.

463
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:48,160
And are there any last thoughts or maybe scroll over to the schedule of the course again just so we can close on that?

464
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,718
1: Yeah, we're halfway through.

465
01:07:52,804 --> 01:08:00,590
We just completed the third discussion section now, so we've had three lectures and three discussions.

466
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,900
It's all downhill from here.

467
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:05,810
By the way, this was the first midterm.

468
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:08,180
You guys both did well.

469
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:26,326
1: We're going to head into session 4 with these last three, how agents use multiple communication channels and that's going to get connected to the quantum FEP, how spacetime emerges from communication, which is something that we've brought up a bunch, it's been in the background, but making that explicit is going to be exciting.

470
01:08:30,102 --> 01:08:44,750
And then section 6, I think, is just going to be such a jumping-off point because the scope and the intensity of what is transpiring is extreme,so connecting it to biology, which is to say life more fully, and where we go in '23 and beyond, that's going to be awesome.

471
01:08:57,448 --> 01:08:59,510
So, any last words, Ander?

472
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:03,160
No, I just echo what you said.

473
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:15,690
I would say it's going to be uphill in terms of how interesting it's going to get, uphill in a good sense, meaning that we're planning.

474
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:23,654
Cool, well, I encourage people to check out the course website and submit questions that they'd like to see addressed by Chris.

475
01:09:23,702 --> 01:09:27,494
Also to register and join these participatory discussions.

476
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:45,714
There'll be three more of them, so if you want to join, share your QRF, be part of the publication of all of these works that we'll compile at the end and just get your exoskeleton in the game with what is happening here.

477
01:09:45,752 --> 01:09:51,460
1: It'd be really awesome to hear more voices and to have more on board.

478
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:56,180
Okay, thank you, Dean, and Ander, till next time.

479
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:56,830
Bye.
