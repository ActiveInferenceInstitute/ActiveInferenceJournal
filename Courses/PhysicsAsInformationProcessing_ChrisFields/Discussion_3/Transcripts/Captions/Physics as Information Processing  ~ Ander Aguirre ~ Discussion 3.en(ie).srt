1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,200
hello and welcome it's July 29th 2023

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,219
and we're here in session three

3
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:15,780
discussion

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,420
of the course physics this information

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,340
processing at the Active inference

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,600
Institute

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,359
we're having a follow-up discussion on

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,180
Chris fields's third lecture on Quantum

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,800
reference frames

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,140
and we're looking forward to your

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,300
participation so if you're watching

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,340
along live and you've been invited to

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,140
the calendar event it's not too late to

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,719
jump in if you're watching on YouTube

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,800
you can write any questions or comments

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,960
in the live chat with Dean and Andrew

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,780
here we're going to be looking at some

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,260
of the key points and taking it in a few

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,960
different directions sharing our

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,260
reference frames making a shared one so

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,379
enter be awesome to

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,180
have you zoom in a little bit on the

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,519
slide and then

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,580
feel free to to take us through some of

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,880
the key points so that we can

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,100
um see a little bit how you're seeing it

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,720
thank you

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,119
that looks good yep

29
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,780
okay so let's let's start by reviewing

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,439
um

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,200
the last lecture from a couple weeks ago

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,939
and then we can open up the discussions

33
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,799
if there's any questions that appear in

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,960
the live chat we can address those

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,900
uh all right so

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,860
lecture two Chris introduced this idea

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,360
of uh

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,820
the information processing between

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,280
system amb you know where they interact

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,479
via qubits on a boundary and they have

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,119
um reference frames

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,420
that give meaning to this com to this

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,720
communication you want to think of uh

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,399
information processing as a

45
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,720
communication Channel

46
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,180
uh the way

47
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,899
um Shannon thought about it uh so that

48
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,098
was the lecture too

49
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,760
and lecture three a couple weeks ago

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,700
uh try to make this more explicit

51
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,160
by emphasizing the idea that this has to

52
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,480
be

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,379
physically embodied somewhere okay and I

54
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,319
I think that because we are so used to

55
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,220
information being fungible

56
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,720
in no small part because of the internet

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,300
and everything uh it's it's a little

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,200
hard

59
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,480
uh to understand at first when the

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,420
claims made that you have a qri that

61
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,980
it's non-fungible or you have a piece of

62
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,599
quantum information that's not fungible

63
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,300
or things like the no cloning theorem

64
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,160
we're so used information being

65
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,500
punishable to it being zeros and ones

66
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,260
that

67
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,800
it's a bit of a change in in mindset at

68
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,360
first but that's exactly what lecture

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,340
three

70
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,000
um introduced this was all all stuff

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,400
right um could you maybe just unpack

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,560
that a little bit what would it mean for

73
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,140
information to be fungible or what's

74
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,300
that stance like and then what does it

75
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,159
mean for information to be non-fungible

76
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,739
and what is that stance like

77
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,819
yeah I'm about to get there uh so let me

78
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,860
let me scroll down the slides um because

79
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,780
that's addressed here so I was maybe I

80
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,040
should have kept this uh in the

81
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,519
beginning but anyways session two talked

82
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,200
about how information Theory makes this

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,599
simple and obvious okay

84
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,700
yeah

85
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,379
session three we talk about reference

86
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,260
frames and mechanistically how all of

87
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,480
this works

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,580
um so yeah let's address that question

89
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,720
of the difference between

90
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,420
hold on one second let me

91
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,040
use my mouse to scroll down here

92
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,239
okay so that's that's a little faster

93
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,340
right

94
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,140
okay so

95
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,220
um

96
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,900
can you restate your question uh Daniel

97
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,940
yeah what would it mean for information

98
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,420
to be fungible or non-fungible

99
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,099
people might be familiar with that in

100
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,200
the economic setting with non-fungible

101
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,939
tokens and all of that but what are we

102
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,199
talking about with informational

103
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,298
fungibility

104
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,560
I I think it basically comes down to

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,660
um to whether you can replicate I mean

106
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,280
it's basically the difference between

107
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,020
classical and Quantum information as far

108
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,759
as I know uh

109
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,400
uh uh fungible information is everything

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,020
that you can basically turn into a

111
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,360
message of zeros and ones

112
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,919
uh

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,860
it's you know how you transmit it maybe

114
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,479
different you know the channel the

115
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,699
physical hardware and so on but but at

116
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,160
the end of the day

117
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,120
it's something that you can write on a

118
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,280
boundary and something that you can

119
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,320
transmit at zero seven ones whereas

120
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,050
Quantum information

121
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,020
[Music]

122
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,759
um you literally have to send the

123
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,620
hardware the piece of Hardware uh the

124
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,320
qrf at least that's how I understand it

125
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,639
so a simple answer might be

126
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,800
um that it's

127
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,540
information encoded in a piece of

128
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,340
software versus a piece of Hardware but

129
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,139
I I don't I don't think that analogy is

130
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,400
perfect

131
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,840
but what do you

132
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,360
yeah Dean what do you think

133
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,000
well here's what I'm curious about

134
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,460
and again you guys can help me with this

135
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,039
as opposed to reference frames I

136
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,440
oftentimes

137
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,720
default to frame of reference and I know

138
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,639
then one of the live streams what I

139
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,440
tried to bring out was the idea that

140
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,539
there was an ice cream cone looking in

141
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,060
an ice cream truck and the question was

142
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,340
always whether or not which which one of

143
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,220
those two entities is one is in the

144
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,259
foreground and one is in the background

145
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,740
and in this slide that Ander has a the

146
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,860
question is is the non-fungibility

147
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,020
because

148
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,039
only A and B can decide whether the a

149
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,620
the VA as seen by B the a is deeper

150
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,759
into that image be based on our frame of

151
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,940
reference and the B is closer or is the

152
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,880
B the one that's actually deeper and the

153
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,740
a is the one that's in the foreground

154
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,699
and I was wondering whether the idea of

155
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:23,340
non-copyability is because of that depth

156
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,500
of field aspect that cannot be

157
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
determined unless it's literally handed

158
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,699
over

159
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,340
the way that Chris was describing it

160
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,080
I think I think that's basically

161
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,020
accurate I think

162
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,360
um I'm not sure I can answer the

163
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,880
question but I think I have the feeling

164
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,800
that Chris

165
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,660
well Chris said this in the lecture that

166
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,020
I mean

167
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,699
is somewhere in your your nervous system

168
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,460
and uh here whether I mean you bring up

169
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,020
a good point right it looks like this

170
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,960
slide is a bit of a an optical illusion

171
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,580
whether you see A or B deeper uh I guess

172
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,900
it depends on something going on inside

173
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,979
your head

174
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,680
um if you this picture is so symmetrical

175
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,900
that if you focus on albumin you can

176
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,300
change your opinion

177
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,639
um what would just to even

178
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,919
connect that to what we're talking about

179
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,560
the classical fungible information on

180
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,599
the holographic screen on the blanket

181
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,240
and then the quantum cognitive rotation

182
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,940
is those two images

183
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,199
are on the screen identical and then

184
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,259
whether it gets a Quantum rotation such

185
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,400
that the uh three points of the axes are

186
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,520
closer to us than the intersection on

187
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,620
that kind of tetrahedron or the other

188
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,300
way around whether the ballerina is

189
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,880
rotating one way or the other that's not

190
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,819
on the boundary so the information about

191
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,639
the depth of field

192
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,560
is part of the qrf or part of the

193
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,259
enactment of the qrf and it's not

194
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,880
written on the boundary

195
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,099
and that goes back to the preparation

196
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,160
question and not just the measuring yeah

197
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,139
like if the preparation if your whole

198
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,020
enculturation or the last five minutes

199
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,479
it was uh entrained or you were holding

200
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,020
an object that predisposed you to think

201
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,240
that the vertex of the intersection was

202
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,680
further away

203
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,960
that's the preparation that's your

204
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,639
that's your prior so that when you get

205
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,059
this ambiguous artifact you rotate it

206
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,279
into the most natural

207
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,399
position cognitively

208
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,140
and that's the preparation that sets you

209
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,760
up for measurement no measurement can

210
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,219
happen without a preparation

211
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,620
what do you think Andrew

212
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,959
uh sure yeah

213
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,070
everything is that makes sense

214
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,480
[Music]

215
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,620
um

216
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,080
so uh perhaps let me

217
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,580
uh

218
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,620
let me recall what was that around the

219
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,140
slides uh there was a

220
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,320
in this whole Spirit or philosophy of

221
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,519
making

222
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,260
emphasizing on information is physical

223
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,140
you know inconcubing this whole thing

224
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,519
for me

225
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,920
um one of the

226
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,940
aglarian emissions in in physics was

227
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,920
the embodiment of

228
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,680
the reference frame which was treated as

229
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,540
an abstraction

230
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,640
um you know in classical physics

231
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,220
such as by galindale but maybe even

232
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,399
Einstein even if he my hunch is that he

233
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,800
did have more of this Instinct of you

234
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,180
know particularly in all those thought

235
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,860
experiments of trying to chase the

236
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,240
library

237
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,580
you are chasing the library right so at

238
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,320
the end of the day

239
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,420
um but I mean this this is a whole

240
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,519
process of making the Observer and the

241
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,440
reference frame more and more explicit

242
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,240
and more and more physical

243
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,920
because at the end of the day it has to

244
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,459
right if if you start with this

245
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,440
assumption that

246
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,160
um

247
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,740
solipsistic assumption almost that you

248
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,459
know all you see and and you know is is

249
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:09,120
part of the same material uh ether that

250
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,120
you are then you know

251
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,980
then you are part of the universe that

252
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,560
in Europe serving something that is out

253
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,980
there uh so you need to make include a

254
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,720
theory of what it means for you to be

255
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,580
observing that right and at the end of

256
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,440
the day the Observer has to be physical

257
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,620
that's what was emphasized by by Chris

258
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,540
at the beginning of this lecture

259
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,420
so this jump from treating the reference

260
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,459
frame as an abstraction

261
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,980
to a real physical entity

262
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,620
and

263
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,360
yeah these are

264
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,500
these people have uh

265
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,820
about uh

266
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,339
in these papers that are ordered there

267
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,680
but I should also remark

268
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,920
uh if folks want to see this it's it's

269
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,680
coming up in high energy Theory also in

270
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,300
the recent work of

271
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,060
um in recent work of saskins and others

272
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,740
where they talk about Quantum reference

273
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,680
traits uh very explicit so I don't I

274
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,839
don't have the citations off the bat but

275
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,060
it's definitely becoming an important

276
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,880
thing in the last 20 years this attempt

277
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,339
to really explicitly treat the reference

278
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,019
frame on the Observer asset Quantum

279
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,680
entity uh as a physical entity

280
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,800
okay so this

281
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,140
that's what I just said okay the jump

282
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,959
from treating things reference rooms as

283
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,540
abstractions to physical objects

284
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,019
go

285
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,260
and

286
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,480
and because we cannot make

287
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,079
a perfect copy of quantum information we

288
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,880
say that these are unique and clonable

289
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,800
and unfungible

290
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,839
um so

291
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,300
in order to recreate an experiment

292
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,060
perfectly uh this is the this is the

293
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,220
address as a part of fungibility or not

294
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,519
right Canalis if you have some sort of

295
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,100
Quantum experiment and Analysis involved

296
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,959
are you know it's the usual

297
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,019
DPR uh thought experiment or whatever

298
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:13,620
Alice involved are separated by light

299
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,060
years

300
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,459
is it enough if you want to recreate the

301
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:21,060
same exact the same experiment for Alice

302
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,320
to send

303
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,420
string of zeros and ones

304
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:24,970
well

305
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,160
[Music]

306
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,959
if you had an experiment where that's

307
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,180
enough then then you can recreate it

308
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,640
with tangible information if not

309
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,320
then you need to somehow send

310
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,200
non-tangible information which really

311
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,399
implies in a piece of hardware

312
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,899
um can I can I add another uh another

313
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,839
piece here look on the previous uh slide

314
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,579
so

315
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:54,060
this looks really Technical and

316
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,700
scientific but let's think about Alice's

317
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,839
laboratory is Alice's brain mind and

318
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,360
Bob's analogously Alice is thinking

319
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,079
about what to say and then says it and

320
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,899
that information might be written in a

321
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,940
chat form it might be said verbally it

322
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,040
might be transmitted through digital or

323
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,339
analog signal but at some point it's

324
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,720
going through this classical

325
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,760
informational interface and then Bob's

326
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,160
laboratory is like perceiving and

327
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,860
unpacking it and the question of

328
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,800
semantic alignment is such that if Alice

329
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,459
gives a shopping list of 10 items if

330
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,139
there's semantic alignment Bob would be

331
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,180
able to go to the store and then find

332
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,820
those 10 items and it made me think of

333
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,060
the the dictionary definition of left

334
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,920
and right so this gets back to our

335
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,440
discussion of whether the vertex on

336
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,899
these axes is coming towards us or away

337
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,120
from us so I looked up the dictionary

338
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,279
definition of left

339
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,459
on towards or relating to the side of a

340
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,920
human body or of a thing that is to the

341
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,019
West when the person or that thing is

342
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,019
facing north so that's I guess one

343
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,300
attempt to Anchor what it means to be

344
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,579
left the second definition is the left

345
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,680
hand part side or direction and you

346
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,060
could imagine there's an analogous

347
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,000
definition for right the point is you

348
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,959
can't describe verbally

349
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,779
leftness and rightness or chirality in

350
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,040
general

351
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,740
because its reference is an embodied

352
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,420
perspective

353
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,940
and so if Alice said okay you're gonna

354
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,980
go down the street and then turn left at

355
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,899
the stop sign

356
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,920
how would Alice communicate to Bob

357
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,519
what leftness meant at that stop sign

358
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,279
versus rightness

359
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,639
and that's this question of flipping

360
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,800
and the way that the quantum formalism

361
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,320
accommodates that is through the wick

362
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,839
rotation and the quantum cognitive

363
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,959
events where the fungible

364
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,160
transmittable holographic information

365
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,279
gets rotated into the imaginary axis

366
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,699
with the formalisms that enable it to be

367
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,680
rotated at all but that means you could

368
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,079
rotate it left quote or rotate it right

369
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,420
yeah I think that's

370
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,699
that's a very good explanation I don't

371
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,680
know if I have much to add Dean you

372
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,300
wanted to say something

373
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,240
well so but

374
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,519
I can't I don't know the answer to this

375
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,920
but to take what Daniel just said to

376
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,680
take the basic

377
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,079
concept of being able to

378
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,380
take something that for all intents and

379
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,740
purposes can appear one way or another

380
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,680
and then turn that into how Chris closed

381
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,019
the last lecture with

382
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,540
we are we are seeing ourselves as both

383
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,940
being entangled

384
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,800
and also

385
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,980
being separatable how did we go

386
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,260
literally from a three-dimension Vertex

387
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,440
to we are both entangled and we're we're

388
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,920
not living in a paradox that's just the

389
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,240
way it is we're also

390
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,320
removing ourselves or separating

391
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,199
ourselves at the same time that's what I

392
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,839
would like to know because

393
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,820
somewhere between

394
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,360
three arbitrary lines and complexity is

395
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,920
not a paradox

396
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,079
something has to be happening and I'm

397
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,420
not exactly sure how that transition

398
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,439
plays out

399
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,420
anybody want to enlighten me

400
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,519
can you repeat your question please well

401
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,000
how do we how do we go like from at this

402
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,399
point of the reference frame

403
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,220
description of saying it can't

404
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,160
you you can't copy it all you can do is

405
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
pass it

406
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,040
because we think things could be flipped

407
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,140
based on internal

408
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,059
internal reference frames internal

409
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,059
meanings and internal models the thing

410
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,179
we choose for context

411
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:13,919
goes all the way out to the conclusion

412
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,220
of and uh of Chris's

413
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,980
um conversation with us in in number

414
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,439
three where he said

415
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,839
bottom line is is that it's not a

416
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,780
paradox that as Things become more and

417
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,460
more complex

418
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,620
then it it wants to be able it it wants

419
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,960
to get to a place of entanglement

420
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,500
alignment a sense of agreement and at

421
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,720
the same time wants to remain separate

422
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,020
so between those two things

423
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,679
a whole lot has happened but and I don't

424
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,840
think we've skipped over it but we

425
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,160
certainly haven't

426
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,400
opened it up and really looked at it

427
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,559
closely and I'm just curious what's in

428
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,020
between those two scales

429
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,900
I I agree I think we're we're gonna

430
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,360
cover that towards the end of the of the

431
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,380
talk um

432
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,260
but I agree I I don't know how you see

433
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,380
this related to qrs uh or the stuff we

434
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,120
just talked about but I think it's the

435
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,679
big question in this in this lecture

436
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,600
right that was like where does this

437
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,700
tension between

438
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,580
increase in complexity and you know

439
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,580
wanting wanting to predict what the

440
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,439
environment is doing what one requires

441
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,640
separability at least colloquially

442
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,419
speaking I I think this tension

443
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,799
is

444
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:38,640
um

445
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,799
basically what the free energy principle

446
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,240
comes down to right Daniel what do you

447
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,320
think

448
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,480
you have the free energy and you have

449
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,640
the E minus TS

450
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,860
one is prediction error I mean not

451
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,539
exactly e minus TS right that would be

452
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,059
thermodynamics but you know one is

453
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:57,240
prediction error and the other one is

454
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,640
what was it

455
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,179
I can't remember

456
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:05,100
I'll definitely look forward to the the

457
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,200
technical unpacking that that you'll get

458
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
to soon but but I was reminded of the

459
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,360
William Blake quotation do what you will

460
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,120
this Life's a fiction and is made up of

461
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,559
contradiction

462
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,160
so let's modify that

463
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,799
um project what you will rotate what you

464
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,980
will space times a fiction

465
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,020
not that it's false but that it's a

466
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,539
projected fictionalization that it

467
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,460
doesn't have the ontological Primacy

468
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,620
that the topology of communication does

469
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,160
and is made up of contradiction yes and

470
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,820
it's made up of this tension between

471
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,940
fitting and not overfitting between

472
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,520
aligning and the principle of unitarity

473
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,799
and differentiating and becoming through

474
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,020
others we become ourselves and that type

475
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,400
of articulation and uh recognizing that

476
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
two complementary forces like convex and

477
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,299
concave come into existence at once like

478
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:09,500
a zero to two jump

479
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,919
is not an issue or or a stumbling block

480
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,620
it's that we wouldn't have it any other

481
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,299
way

482
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,760
couldn't have it any other way

483
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,660
yeah uh sure we'll get that towards the

484
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,179
end uh you can almost even call it a

485
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,059
duality it's not uh far-fetched I mean

486
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,980
it's it's the sort of thing that I think

487
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,360
most people will be happy to take for

488
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,880
granted such you know super symmetry

489
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,260
like you have

490
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,299
two kinds of particles but the same

491
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,160
amount of them and you know dualities

492
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,380
are all over the place so I I think I

493
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,900
think it's fairly it's not unreasonable

494
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,000
to just accept that there are there is a

495
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,340
tension between uh increasing complexity

496
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,900
which

497
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,940
you want you want AME to be separable

498
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,320
for and

499
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,140
accuracy prediction now how this is

500
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,520
related to

501
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,440
um emergent space and uh on this curves

502
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,780
stuff you know I I don't want to make

503
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,120
very part fetch claims we'll talk about

504
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,940
emergent space later on the course uh

505
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,280
but but for now let's let's say a few

506
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,660
more words about carefs and then we'll

507
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,539
get to the the complexity stuff towards

508
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:19,440
the end

509
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,460
um

510
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,080
so

511
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,480
so qrfs are almost building blocks if

512
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,340
you want or

513
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,600
uh

514
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,980
information processing uh here it's very

515
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,900
uh useful to recall definition that I

516
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,900
feel I think we we have

517
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,700
mentioned before

518
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,700
of information as being differences that

519
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,159
make a difference that's probably the

520
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,960
best colloquial definition of

521
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,900
information I've heard and I think

522
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,700
I think it does a lot of work I mean

523
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,280
it's almost mathematical but anyways we

524
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,900
need to unpack it a little more and and

525
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,400
see so

526
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,820
for a difference to make a difference

527
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,700
what do you want out of qrf right

528
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,740
and surprisingly I mean not surprisingly

529
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,600
but

530
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,100
reassuringly I think would be the work

531
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,960
uh

532
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,159
you need a qrf to have sensory

533
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,260
action

534
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,480
and a default state right this is sort

535
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,659
of like uh where your basing prior

536
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,120
distribution is encoded these three

537
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,200
things

538
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,900
we'll give you a building block for any

539
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,740
information processing and that you know

540
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,140
ties together with all the work in the

541
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,360
free energy literature

542
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,080
and perception action loops and and

543
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,299
whatnot

544
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:48,480
um so before we see mathematically

545
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,179
poetry RF is defined

546
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,580
uh I think it's more illustrative and I

547
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,980
think Chris went exactly on the right

548
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,080
order when when he presented this a

549
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,460
couple weeks ago

550
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,659
teen uh examples from age

551
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,940
these are actual pieces of forward that

552
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,580
are effectively curios and it's it's

553
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,520
remarkable how they map to

554
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,980
well I'll skip ahead a little bit but

555
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,620
when you get to the to the mathematical

556
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,080
definition of the qrf as a Quantum

557
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,179
system that

558
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,580
um you know you can specify with with

559
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,039
this category Theory diagram you know

560
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,200
you have incoming arrows into a node

561
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,120
that then they expands right and this

562
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,860
graphic correspond to measurement and

563
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,740
preparation degrees of not degrees of

564
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,539
300 degrees of freedom would be the same

565
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,520
right when you attach it to the boundary

566
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,280
but measurement and preparation stages I

567
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,500
guess would be the the better word ah

568
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,640
but

569
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,520
but anyways let me go back to to these

570
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,780
examples right

571
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,940
um and Daniel your the biologist here so

572
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,280
correct me bye say anything wrong here

573
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,799
you have uh

574
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,440
uh cartoon picture of a bacteria I think

575
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,659
and

576
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,940
this is a very simple sort of thing

577
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,679
right it navigates in in the direction

578
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,140
of food

579
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,880
and and that's it right so it is a very

580
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,640
simple rudimentary example of a curve

581
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,179
you have the sensory

582
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,480
uh

583
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,100
stage here I guess the degrees of

584
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,039
freedom I guess the degrees of freedom

585
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,840
um it's not obvious here what the

586
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,220
boundary is that's one thing uh but it

587
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,720
is a good enough picture to see the

588
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,120
resemblance to here we have the

589
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,140
measurement

590
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,240
which in this in this case you're trying

591
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,360
to measure concentration of food you

592
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,260
have your node here

593
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,600
scene

594
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,299
which is your prior distribution for

595
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:52,799
concentration of food

596
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,559
and finally you have the the preparation

597
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,520
stage

598
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,140
which is your

599
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,760
you know this the rest of this chemical

600
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,100
Network that will control

601
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,980
uh and steer this bacterium right so

602
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,620
there's here you want to call it the

603
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,900
action degrees of freedom

604
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,720
um that will steer this bacteria in the

605
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,220
direction of food

606
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,440
and likewise with cell division this I

607
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,900
understand even less the network appears

608
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,020
more complicated uh but I think it's

609
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,299
fair to say that at the end of the day

610
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,120
all these chemical Networks

611
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,480
that appears super complicated

612
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,980
somehow have to be mapped to this

613
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,140
category theoretical diagram that's

614
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,659
that's all there is to it you're going

615
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:43,260
to have the sensory input and the action

616
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,880
output

617
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,679
again you're gonna have to

618
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,760
the default chemical concentration which

619
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,320
amounts to this to this node over here

620
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,440
you remember this from last lecture

621
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,440
right Daniel yeah in the cone cocon we

622
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,260
explored also in in live stream 17 on

623
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,600
the Bayesian semantic information flow

624
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,120
but I'll kind of add a point about these

625
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,059
biological systems

626
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,400
um in relationship to to artificially

627
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,880
specified systems and what that helps us

628
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,620
understand about perception cognition

629
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,460
action so the cone cocone diagram has

630
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,820
this bow tie architecture or this kind

631
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,220
of like two pyramids touching point to

632
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,480
point where there's a preparation and a

633
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,340
measurement which can be

634
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,380
um different dimensionalities or or

635
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,200
different Scopes like you could be

636
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,960
multi-input multi-output or multi-input

637
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,140
single output vice versa and so on but

638
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,900
they come through this

639
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,380
eye of the needle with C Prime here now

640
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,200
contrast that kind of architecture

641
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,419
um represented here abstractly with what

642
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:01,320
we see in the bacterial process and in

643
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,220
the cell division process these have

644
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,740
that kind of a bow tie perception

645
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,679
cognition action architecture or

646
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,120
measurement cognitive integration

647
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,580
preparation architecture

648
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,580
in contrast we see for example an

649
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,400
artificial neural network where the

650
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,580
input and the output layers are usually

651
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,820
lower dimensional maybe uh in an image

652
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,220
coming in with several hundred pixels

653
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,919
and a single output like a classifier

654
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,080
coming out the other end but a

655
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,200
dimensional explosion in those internal

656
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,320
cognitive layers but in biological

657
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,900
systems it's actually exactly the

658
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,059
opposite for example many many many

659
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:51,120
receptors on the cell surface on the

660
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,820
holographic boundary the sensorium of

661
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,360
the cell but then there are these common

662
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,580
secondary Messengers

663
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,000
that many Pathways converge upon

664
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,820
so that reflects the kind of radically

665
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,039
different

666
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,880
architecture that a qrf embodies as

667
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,480
opposed to the approach taken by

668
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,220
disembodied intelligence Frameworks

669
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,620
which use dimensional explosion

670
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,179
internally

671
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,600
to try to categorize and classify and

672
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,659
find find edge cases versus this

673
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:30,960
dimensional winnowing that is reflective

674
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,820
of these embodied intelligences

675
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,700
um

676
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,820
anybody make a tangential comment here

677
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,580
also no I think the good thing about

678
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,559
these two examples is that they also

679
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,000
showcase

680
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,900
the fact of how how you know

681
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,080
the the Deep implications of scale free

682
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,580
biology if you want to call it this way

683
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,200
we tend to think of

684
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,860
these sorts of processes right of such

685
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,960
as here

686
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,940
only happening at the level of the

687
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,000
nervous system in animals or as you said

688
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,980
neural nerves right we tend to associate

689
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,380
this with neural networks and and

690
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,600
perhaps Evolution has tear does in a way

691
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,220
that's

692
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,320
um endowed us with nervous systems to

693
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,120
make these things maybe these are higher

694
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,039
up in the in the in the layers

695
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:23,039
uh but really there is you know that's a

696
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,360
bit of an arbitrary distinction that we

697
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,700
make you know the process is going on at

698
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,980
the cellular level even if they don't

699
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,539
appear to have anything to do with the

700
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,220
nervous system

701
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,700
my understanding is that uh they are

702
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,980
there are there are some generic

703
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,600
properties that are the same and

704
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,799
everything that has to do with

705
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,720
information processing you know it

706
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,240
manifests maybe a slightly different

707
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,080
uh when it comes to explicit nerves but

708
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,179
at the end of the day it's the same

709
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:52,799
generic process going on would you would

710
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,940
you say that's right Daniel

711
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,100
the the ontological claim is that it's

712
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,919
the same generic process happening

713
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:03,779
whereas the more instrumentalist claim

714
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:07,380
is that we can model it with some shared

715
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,000
abstractions

716
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,399
[Music]

717
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,980
yeah okay so we can we can continue

718
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,360
right

719
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,440
um

720
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,539
so

721
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:21,120
uh

722
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,820
from you know I I don't have a whole lot

723
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,960
to say Daniel

724
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,360
said quite a bit about at the end of the

725
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,140
day craft is is you can visualize it as

726
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,179
this diagram and you know you can think

727
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,539
of it as if you are more familiar with a

728
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:39,120
picture of a neural network and ways on

729
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,059
a neural network and so on that's the

730
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:44,399
way to think about it

731
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,039
now let's continue with explicit

732
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,059
embodiment if you wish uh so qrfs in in

733
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:55,200
the formalism have to be attached to

734
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,919
a boundary boundary degrees of terms and

735
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,340
I should add another remark here I think

736
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,919
and personally to me also like the hard

737
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,559
part about uh

738
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,020
this Quantum free energy principle

739
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,600
formalism if you wish is is what you

740
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,740
said at the beginning is the fact that

741
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,720
it's topological right so so very often

742
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,039
it's not clear what the boundary degrees

743
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,799
of freedom of right because we tend to

744
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,600
think of boundaries as

745
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,299
you know

746
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,260
geometrical and certainly the classical

747
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,580
fep

748
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,740
s the most geometrical

749
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,080
uh that's not the case here in the

750
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,080
quantum for energy uh formalism and

751
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,480
where we have emerging space with us

752
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,840
what we talked about in later sessions

753
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,760
but that's just like one one quick

754
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,380
remark to make

755
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,740
at the end of the day though

756
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,840
even if it's topological we're going to

757
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,940
have real degrees of freedom that

758
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,740
um these

759
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,679
your ref is attached to this cone cocon

760
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,700
diagram

761
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,980
and you're going to have measurement

762
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,260
operators that you don't

763
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,140
um classical outcomes

764
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,940
plus and minus one

765
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,500
and

766
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,179
uh

767
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:13,200
and then you can think of this PRN

768
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,200
um or more abstract like this diagram as

769
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,260
as a neural network if you wish acting

770
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,720
on those under qubits

771
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,880
and then back propagating

772
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,520
some sort of action signal preparation

773
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,879
um okay

774
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,760
then let's not forget that uh Land hours

775
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,779
principle

776
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,240
and so on

777
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,580
requires that we are mindful of energy

778
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,179
constraints on computation

779
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:47,100
and that gives us

780
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,939
the following picture

781
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,820
uh number one we're gonna have to

782
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,600
use energy from the environment to fuel

783
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,480
our computation to fill our observation

784
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,820
so that means that right away you cannot

785
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,580
use the entirety of your boundary to

786
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,700
gather information you're there's it

787
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,519
necessitates a uh

788
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,760
an allocation of resources right

789
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,200
uh

790
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,380
here e is the observed environment and

791
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,960
the blue portion is a thermodynamical

792
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,760
sector

793
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,039
where you extract free energy and and

794
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,159
dump key in order to run this

795
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,080
computational process and then

796
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,940
furthermore you can have

797
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,460
uh a memory sector where you write

798
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,740
things on a boundary okay and these

799
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,120
takes up energy also right driving

800
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,980
information on onto the boundary by

801
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,659
Latin hours principle will take up

802
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:47,580
information

803
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,159
and uh critical is the minimal interest

804
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,320
in observer

805
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,820
because it has a memory sector and why

806
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,360
minimal here uh implies that we have at

807
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,419
least minimal interesting implies that

808
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:06,960
we have more than one layer here the

809
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,839
process of writing things into the

810
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,580
into a memory sector

811
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,699
requires us to have a clock so that we

812
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,159
can label those memories

813
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,800
um in time okay so we do have time as

814
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,540
part of this formalism just not space

815
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,780
yet okay no time has to be

816
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,659
internal to the help server

817
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,139
just just one piece on that that Chris

818
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,179
mentioned

819
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:38,280
um as and as you echoed time here is an

820
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,359
attribute of some cognitive systems in

821
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:45,960
terms of their internal understanding so

822
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,839
that they can sort memories and

823
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,899
understand what came earlier or later

824
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,300
it's not something that's a priori

825
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,660
defined externally which is the case in

826
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,300
the kind of space time first now how do

827
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,060
we fit communication into here

828
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,000
we flip that we're talking about the

829
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,339
topology of communication as

830
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,859
ontologically primal

831
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,500
and now certain kinds of sophisticated

832
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,720
agents that's not like necessarily true

833
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,420
of a rock or a metronome or a particle

834
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,180
of a gas but some kinds of cognitive

835
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,960
systems are such that they are able to

836
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,320
generate an internal clock concept

837
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,960
and that doesn't have to be the same

838
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,460
thing as what's happening on the wall

839
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,859
with Chronos this can reflect a purely

840
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:37,140
internal time Kairos that enables

841
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,119
observers or interactors that have

842
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,220
different clock structures and then Land

843
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,579
hours principle helps us Arbitrage or

844
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:48,180
connect the informational demands to the

845
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,420
energetic or the metabolic demands Dean

846
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,140
oh so when I when I first listened to

847
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,099
the lecture I thought when the when the

848
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:02,160
term or phrase trade-off

849
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,099
was raised I

850
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,079
I traditionally have thought of tradeoff

851
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,119
as kind of a binary

852
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,460
if I'm picking this

853
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,920
I'm trading off against all the other

854
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,079
things that I didn't pick

855
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,400
so one or or the other or others plural

856
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,640
but when I saw when I saw this and

857
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,320
especially when I heard it in the

858
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,960
context of things like degrees of

859
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,460
freedom I began to wonder whether it is

860
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,619
because it could sit on either side of

861
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:37,079
that boundary it could be a priori or it

862
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,700
could be ad hoc or post-talk a trade-off

863
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,760
which prior to

864
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,579
this conversation I just assumed that a

865
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,880
trade-off was one or the other

866
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,560
but essentially what this implies is it

867
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,320
it isn't even it's still a kind of a

868
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,940
degree of

869
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,900
of how much weight you put into it and

870
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,820
then it you kind of cross a threshold

871
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,400
and then you've made your pick you've

872
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,040
you've completed your trade-off or did I

873
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,960
again

874
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,200
did I misinterpret what I was hearing if

875
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,940
it's if it's topological as opposed to

876
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,680
this the more conventional space-time

877
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,660
perspective

878
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,020
is this can can a trade-off be both ad

879
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,060
hoc and post hoc

880
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,680
seemingly at the same time

881
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,079
very interesting question

882
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,960
let us just let it float and continue on

883
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,540
enter all right because maybe because

884
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,960
again if it's if it I'll just say this

885
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,560
if it if it can be that

886
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,140
that would really move us out of the

887
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,320
classical Realm

888
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,540
that would essentially say that anytime

889
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,000
we've made a pick we re we really

890
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,680
haven't made a pick

891
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,119
there's still a whole bunch of other

892
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,599
things that are going to happen that can

893
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,839
that can change whatever that

894
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,839
action is that we thought we

895
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,420
carried out or enacted if we're talking

896
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,740
about in in an internet intern

897
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,060
internality state

898
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,839
which is what I think we want I think we

899
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,400
want to be able to change our minds

900
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,359
but let me take that one way Dean

901
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:40,260
um the the analytical equations of the

902
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,660
action perception Loop

903
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,740
don't tell us in implementation like if

904
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,200
we're going to write it in code whether

905
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,640
we should

906
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,839
use action first

907
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,099
procedurally to update our observations

908
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:01,980
or whether we enable our observations to

909
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,480
to Wag the Dog and then select action at

910
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,800
the end of the loop so is it a

911
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,660
perception action Loop or is an action

912
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:14,160
perception Loop and those enable a kind

913
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,960
of um seesaw where sometimes we want

914
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,839
what we learn to change what we do and

915
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,300
other times we want what we do to change

916
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,859
what we learn

917
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:30,180
and having that kind of a fulcrum or a

918
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,200
pivot

919
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,000
and then again to connect it to the

920
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,820
vertex popping in and out the analytical

921
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,400
formalisms inscribed on the screen of

922
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,599
the fep like the textbooks

923
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,980
they're ambiguous

924
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,740
whether we lead with action and have

925
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,079
inference follow or whether we lead with

926
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,320
inference and and have action follow or

927
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,359
or simply without should have inference

928
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,480
follow whichever one of the combinations

929
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,560
there are

930
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,980
um because we s and then the that

931
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,060
um trade-off or runoff is broken by

932
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:10,260
specific embodied cognitive agents that

933
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,380
that trade-off about the um the

934
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,780
procedural Primacy of perception or

935
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,400
action

936
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,760
can't be broken generically right

937
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,320
it certainly makes for a lot of waste

938
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,280
heat if you're not careful

939
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,880
it'd be exhausting a lot anyway

940
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,520
okay so um

941
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,680
so I I see I I don't know if we can talk

942
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,520
about

943
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,140
intent

944
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,839
um much with this formalism but we can

945
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,660
take a very descriptive uh approach to

946
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,579
it and

947
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:02,460
um go down here a little more

948
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,380
uh actually before I don't want to get

949
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,320
up I'm ahead of myself uh what I mean by

950
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,980
that is

951
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,119
I

952
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,040
whether we can put intent or not in this

953
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,119
hierarchy

954
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,820
um I I don't know I don't know if it

955
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,680
matters a whole lot but at least we can

956
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,780
talk about it you know operationally and

957
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,140
descriptively and and say just like

958
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,900
when you have a clock

959
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,060
uh

960
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,640
you know that the clock is just there

961
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,640
right like it is it if you don't have

962
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,020
the clock you don't have the memory and

963
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,480
that's it right uh and likewise here if

964
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,099
we don't have attention

965
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:44,099
uh an attention control compartment we

966
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,380
just cannot have we cannot play with all

967
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,900
these cure apps uh that are

968
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,240
non-commutative

969
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,920
at the same time

970
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,180
so

971
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,280
if there is no attention control system

972
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,859
to begin with no we don't we cannot talk

973
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:01,020
about a system that has non-commutative

974
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,820
care apps meaning here one one

975
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,800
presumably goes to memory sectors the

976
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,880
other one goes to environment side

977
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,339
persons and so on uh so

978
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,240
so this is certainly a necessity of the

979
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,760
fact that we have

980
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,619
um different sectors of the boundary

981
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,480
being allocated to different purposes

982
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,140
such as environmental observation and

983
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,480
memory and so on

984
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,940
um within the environment it was

985
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,880
it's it's worth remarking that here if

986
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,740
you if you think deeply about first

987
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,480
principles and

988
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,800
what it means to observe an entity

989
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,599
um well you still come down to these

990
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,280
differences that make a difference sort

991
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,640
of thing right which involves whenever

992
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,520
you're looking at the environment to if

993
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,320
you're gonna identify a system you need

994
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,400
sort of a background that tells you

995
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,220
that puts the system in context right so

996
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,900
that you can identify the system as some

997
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,480
something distinct I think this again is

998
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,920
something that we have talked about in

999
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,660
previous

1000
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:10,440
uh discussions where the easiest picture

1001
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,560
here is something like the gauge speed

1002
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,920
gauge in your car where

1003
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,160
p is the gauge itself it tells you

1004
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,660
the speed

1005
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,180
but it's meaningless

1006
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,460
without the reference system right

1007
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,060
outside of outside of the thing that

1008
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,520
stays invariant right the context the

1009
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,900
background

1010
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,680
um

1011
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,720
that Gauge Movie means nothing to you

1012
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,720
okay so the command come back to this

1013
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,300
idea of if we think of information as

1014
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,280
differences that make a difference in

1015
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,560
terms of first principles these

1016
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,240
environment sector that we saw earlier

1017
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,599
has to be further broken down into

1018
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,480
pointer on reference to States

1019
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,099
again this is covered uh in depth in the

1020
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:00,720
increases papers uh I'm thinking

1021
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,520
particularly of

1022
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,560
free energy for generic Quantum systems

1023
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,200
uh and again uh just to reiterate these

1024
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,740
attention control stuff uh compartment

1025
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,740
which is by the way very reminiscent too

1026
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,500
the hierarchy that was earlier with the

1027
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,900
clock uh arising fire up in the

1028
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,859
hierarchy deeper into the layer

1029
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:26,760
um

1030
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,980
likewise whenever we have so whenever

1031
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,420
you're writing something into into a

1032
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,800
memory you need you need to have that

1033
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,260
clock whenever you are deploying

1034
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,760
uncommunicated graphs you're you're

1035
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,960
gonna need

1036
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,520
uh attention

1037
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,859
an attention control compartment and we

1038
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:43,020
just described this operationally

1039
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:43,619
um

1040
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:46,380
if you didn't have it then the agent

1041
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,180
would not be what it is it could not

1042
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,140
deploy those non-communitive QRS

1043
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,819
uh so marching on

1044
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,300
uh we'll just end here with uh pure app

1045
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,280
alignment on the free energy principle

1046
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,520
just a few more words this is possibly

1047
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,180
the most interesting picture in this in

1048
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,119
this uh presentation and just we can

1049
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:16,020
recall here uh possibilities for qrf

1050
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,180
alignment and how

1051
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,359
through energy comes into play in this

1052
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:25,680
in this um formalism

1053
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,960
so is that recall we call a the true

1054
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,940
real interaction we call this a thermal

1055
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,740
interaction

1056
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,720
and and then you have a bunch of

1057
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,460
possibilities right and depending on

1058
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,500
each possibility you're going to see

1059
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,000
things as

1060
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,140
uh notes or as in the paper says

1061
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,700
non-local

1062
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,400
given variables

1063
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,400
uh the last situation is

1064
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,900
uh

1065
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,900
what we call alignment when we have qrfs

1066
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,660
of the same size perfectly aligned

1067
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,400
okay

1068
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,260
to attack by recall I think this

1069
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,720
this would be the situation where you

1070
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,579
have uh

1071
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:10,020
noiseless

1072
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,260
classical uh computation right if you

1073
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,900
have a and b just interacting

1074
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,099
you know

1075
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:21,060
and uh it also also this is the

1076
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,779
situation where

1077
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,000
this is

1078
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,619
this is entanglement right

1079
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,140
asymptotically once all the carers are

1080
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,380
aligned you you have entitled and now we

1081
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,380
can type but maybe

1082
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,680
to Deans earlier so these two these two

1083
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,079
slides conclude the discussion basically

1084
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:45,180
and then we can open it up

1085
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,000
um so given this possibilities for how

1086
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,280
qrfs can be aligned

1087
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,680
here is deployed by a become via line

1088
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,040
uh and how you know in each situation

1089
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,460
you're going to get noise or whatever

1090
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,420
um

1091
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,339
then what does

1092
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:04,920
the free energy principle say in this

1093
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,079
Quantum setting

1094
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,740
well

1095
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:13,200
minimizing variational free energy leads

1096
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,819
you to entanglemental okay so if

1097
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:19,619
theorem here

1098
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:23,760
if you're in a picture of B here and the

1099
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,980
qrfs are are aligned

1100
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,839
uh A and B are going to be intact

1101
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,800
now there is a tension between this

1102
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,400
tendency towards alignment uh us the

1103
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,520
pre-energic principle

1104
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,760
will carry you and uh

1105
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,280
observe reality which is that we're not

1106
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,819
just a blob of entangled particles there

1107
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:52,319
is separability

1108
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,579
and

1109
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,040
systems are attention between

1110
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,300
maintaining separability

1111
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,319
um and at the same time being correlated

1112
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,240
enough to the environment

1113
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,119
just to be able to predict predict it or

1114
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:07,260
come

1115
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,480
and now we can maybe go into a more

1116
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,640
philosophical discussion about the free

1117
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,380
energy principle

1118
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,599
um I should also say

1119
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,940
in the last month I just like I talked

1120
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,740
earlier at traps

1121
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,859
um

1122
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,839
it led me into a rabbit fall of looking

1123
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,560
into his recent work and he's talked a

1124
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,800
lot about complexity uh I'm being very

1125
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,040
speculative here so I if someone can

1126
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,400
call me out uh that would be good in the

1127
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,640
comments but Justice coming through some

1128
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,000
of his papers I saw a monograph of 2018

1129
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,240
where he talks about complexity and

1130
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,160
you know he puts forward the second law

1131
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,400
for complexity in Quantum systems and

1132
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,280
increased complexity and it is very

1133
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,140
reminiscent of what's going on here you

1134
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,119
have a tension between

1135
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,619
uh systems tending to entanglement

1136
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:09,480
beyond the other side of the free energy

1137
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,560
function well if you wish were systems

1138
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,140
increase in complexity and that

1139
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,020
necessarily requires uh

1140
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,780
that A and B are separate

1141
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,940
So Daniel do you have any comments at

1142
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,240
this point

1143
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,579
yeah there's a lot to it I I like that

1144
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:34,200
you showed the four possibilities

1145
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,140
in the image above and and said it was a

1146
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:41,460
one of the most interesting figures I I

1147
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,839
agree

1148
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,660
and uh

1149
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:51,000
how to connect this to the classical fep

1150
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,579
and also how to

1151
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:56,300
see the quantum fep

1152
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:01,020
not as just uh a second story built on

1153
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,020
top of the classical fep which would be

1154
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,220
kind of like a a historical

1155
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,980
chronological understanding of the

1156
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,740
theoretical apparatus but it's almost

1157
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,380
like the quantum fep was like

1158
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,920
a basement we didn't know about

1159
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,000
because it it gives a broader context

1160
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,040
and though it appeared

1161
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,280
conceptually several years later in the

1162
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,680
timeline we understand

1163
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,960
that doesn't give it a secondary

1164
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:36,720
um

1165
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,819
status

1166
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,220
so what it really means for the

1167
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,560
classical fep

1168
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,299
to be kind of like

1169
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,520
a special case

1170
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,160
of this

1171
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:53,940
um

1172
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,980
actually more

1173
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,980
generic

1174
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,720
setting

1175
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,160
there's just a lot I'm very uncertain I

1176
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,339
can I can I I can wrap it up underneath

1177
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:10,200
or you want to say something

1178
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,960
um we can continue with that but let me

1179
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,339
conclude and this is all I have to say

1180
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:16,440
for today

1181
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,400
um

1182
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,579
I I think I mean I'm sure Chris will

1183
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:23,880
explain this more in coming uh sessions

1184
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,220
and lectures but I think the main

1185
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,380
key differences is in is in the

1186
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,660
emergence of of space

1187
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,000
how it might emerge from something more

1188
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,520
fundamental maybe a tensor Network or

1189
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,000
who knows uh but that's that's the big

1190
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,220
big difference right and and I suppose

1191
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,900
the quantum free energy principle

1192
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,940
generalizes

1193
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,380
the classical for energy principle

1194
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,640
because he doesn't have this special

1195
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,180
embedding now uh

1196
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:55,319
this to me personally and and and also

1197
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:57,780
to folks in the audience for asking

1198
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,880
questions is is probably the hardest

1199
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,720
part to wrap your head around and I

1200
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,319
I foresee interest in in those uh

1201
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:09,780
discussions and lectures that deal with

1202
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,940
the concept of emerging space

1203
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,940
because every time you try to connect on

1204
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,319
it I've done this myself I've been

1205
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,599
thinking about how you could apply these

1206
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:21,180
formalism to better known pictures or

1207
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,099
compare it for instance with thermal

1208
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:25,319
equilibrium with relaxation with thermal

1209
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:26,579
equilibrium and then you start thinking

1210
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,200
about okay what is the boundary and so

1211
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,540
on it's far from obvious right because

1212
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,520
again you have to

1213
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,319
remind yourself that the definition is

1214
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,559
topological so in that regard I think it

1215
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,720
might be worth

1216
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,339
um

1217
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:43,559
one of the questions that came up that I

1218
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,119
thought I thought was good

1219
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,359
and and then I can call it a day on this

1220
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:51,180
end uh

1221
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,280
so this question and I think it was the

1222
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,800
first question asked since the last

1223
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,559
lecture can you just read the full

1224
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,660
question and then read the full answer

1225
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,099
thank you the question on the answer

1226
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:04,200
it's number 28 here can you guys see it

1227
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,359
should I zoom in a little bit it's it's

1228
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:08,339
pretty small but but reading it will be

1229
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:09,000
good

1230
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,180
okay so this question I think I've asked

1231
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:15,359
myself this question two

1232
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,339
um maybe with different in a different

1233
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:19,440
way but basically you know it gets to

1234
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,700
the point of what I was saying earlier

1235
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,319
right

1236
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:25,859
um that it would be nice to see how we

1237
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:28,200
can use this Quantum free energy

1238
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,880
principle formalism

1239
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,579
to recover maybe from your settings such

1240
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:35,160
as relaxation to thermal equilibrium via

1241
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,380
ticket equation but that's far from

1242
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,940
movies how you do it if your definition

1243
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,200
is topological right

1244
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,579
so the question says what happens when

1245
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,200
the agent becomes identical to the

1246
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,280
environment

1247
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,319
when the model has been improved so much

1248
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:50,940
that it does not differ from the

1249
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,740
environment is this a stadium impossible

1250
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,140
would it be thermionamical equilibrium

1251
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,140
maximum entanglement okay so clearly

1252
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,300
it's not thermodynamical equilibrium but

1253
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,220
I think what the person is asking if I

1254
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,240
maybe

1255
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,040
if I understand this correctly they're

1256
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,140
wondering okay so it's a free energy

1257
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,520
principle

1258
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,599
drives AME towards entanglement then

1259
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:15,000
it's referred to say that they have that

1260
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,559
any distinction between them has to be

1261
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:17,460
solved

1262
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,140
right that they have merged into the

1263
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,000
same thing

1264
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,200
um

1265
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,720
and that has to do with this whole

1266
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,119
definition of philosophical evade of

1267
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,880
thinness that uh called Princeton you

1268
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,920
know it's a proponent enough right what

1269
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,559
it means for two things to be separate

1270
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,119
I'm coming

1271
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:38,040
so let's see what Chris said

1272
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,700
uh

1273
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:42,960
Kristen has pointed out that the limit

1274
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,819
of the classical fep the limit of

1275
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:46,559
perfect prediction corresponds to

1276
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:47,880
generalized synchronic between system

1277
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,400
and environment each sends messages but

1278
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,160
the other can perfectly predict

1279
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:58,140
uh now however it's clear and I'm not

1280
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,359
reading anymore I'm making a quick

1281
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:02,700
remark here I'll continue in a second

1282
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,099
in the classical fep

1283
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:07,200
it's clear

1284
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,380
that A and B even if they are you know

1285
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,599
in the perfect limit of the fep

1286
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:14,640
they remain

1287
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,819
different the different entities right

1288
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:20,400
because you have that if you wish that

1289
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,960
extra

1290
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,760
uh layers of differentiation coming from

1291
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,160
their spatial embedding right in the in

1292
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,500
the classical fpp that is clear that

1293
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,480
they haven't even if they are getting

1294
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,700
synchronized

1295
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,440
they have not lost their separate

1296
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,119
identities you can always say well this

1297
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,280
is the one that was to the left and this

1298
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,960
is the one that was to the right pun

1299
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,599
intended with earlier discussion right

1300
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:46,260
um

1301
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,880
you have that extra uh

1302
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,339
resource for for separating them if you

1303
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:55,440
wish by virtue of the special embedding

1304
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,880
right the special embedding is giving

1305
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,980
you this extra information that

1306
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,160
allows you to keep track of of of amb

1307
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,300
separately

1308
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,740
okay so I'll continue this notion

1309
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:05,819
depends on the system and its

1310
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:07,200
environment being separated and has

1311
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,119
distinguished somehow

1312
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,920
In classical formulations they are

1313
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,579
separated in ordinary 3D space

1314
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:16,260
different locations so they are

1315
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,460
different because they occupy different

1316
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,319
locations right but if you don't have

1317
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:20,880
that geometric wall

1318
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,920
background then then how you know that

1319
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,260
they're different right okay so I

1320
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,040
continue

1321
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,839
the quantum formulation is background

1322
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,819
free meaning it assumes no space-time

1323
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,559
embedding system and environment do not

1324
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:32,700
have different locations even though

1325
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,680
they have different sets of degrees of

1326
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:38,160
freedom in the overall Hilbert space

1327
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,200
here the fpp

1328
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,540
the limit of the fep is maximum and time

1329
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,500
moment

1330
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,059
this does not mean that the system and

1331
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:46,559
its environment are identical they

1332
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,819
aren't since they have different degrees

1333
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:50,780
of freedom okay so this is just

1334
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:54,059
addresses the question I I just post it

1335
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:56,400
means that the joint state is not

1336
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,780
separable

1337
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,579
okay

1338
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:01,619
um into a system s an environment team

1339
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,900
their states are no longer conditionally

1340
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,119
independent this is distinct from

1341
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:07,859
thermal equilibrium which means that

1342
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:09,599
they have the same temperature while

1343
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,220
remaining separable

1344
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,440
uh and that their interaction can be

1345
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,180
characterized as the change of thermal

1346
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,980
fluctuations I.E knows

1347
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,839
so I guess this is a nice format for

1348
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,420
things that are to come but I I do think

1349
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,880
that this

1350
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,720
or idea of emerging space is going to be

1351
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,680
um

1352
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,960
possibly you know one of one of the most

1353
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,920
important intercourse

1354
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,280
stick out between the classes and the

1355
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,420
quantum formulations for sure

1356
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,859
Dean what's your take on this what what

1357
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:49,559
I saw what I saw was that when you have

1358
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:51,119
that kind of alignment that perfect

1359
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,059
alignment that is one that was one that

1360
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:56,700
was D in that diet in that

1361
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,839
that diagram right that was one state of

1362
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:03,720
a of a complex state that included an A

1363
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,119
and A B and a c and probably a whole

1364
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:08,960
bunch of other ways that

1365
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,960
yeah right so that one

1366
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,420
state where you've got this kind of

1367
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,640
entanglement

1368
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,440
isn't isn't into perpetuity like you

1369
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,480
don't get there and then stay there and

1370
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,280
that's where I think

1371
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,920
the question of separability and

1372
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,660
complexity

1373
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,660
it still works because just because you

1374
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,180
momentarily got into a place that we

1375
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,359
Define here as D doesn't mean you stay

1376
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:37,859
there indefinitely

1377
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:40,140
you could be swapping around to B and C

1378
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,220
and A

1379
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,700
in the next instant

1380
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,160
so that's that at least that holds the

1381
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,260
complexity piece up

1382
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:52,799
that that moment for however long that

1383
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,680
moment is where XA and x b are aligned

1384
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,540
isn't permanent

1385
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,000
so it's it's not predictable in that

1386
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,299
sense therefore it is complex

1387
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:06,180
I still don't know how we get though

1388
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,640
that the closer we get to agreement the

1389
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,760
more complex Things Are

1390
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,460
unless we're just talking about D in

1391
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:18,500
this array of a b c and d

1392
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,579
that goes back to that Quantum reference

1393
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:23,520
frame I think like I said again maybe

1394
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,400
I'm interpreting this wrong but when I

1395
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,440
message pass

1396
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,720
the reason why I have to like literally

1397
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,819
give it over to the other person and let

1398
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,880
them have it I can't give have them copy

1399
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,500
what I'm doing

1400
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,559
is because there has to be

1401
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,900
I guess that reinforces the separability

1402
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,599
piece of this as well the fact that I

1403
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,760
can't give them a copy that I can only

1404
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,260
give them the information and then

1405
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,540
they've got to sort of unpack it in

1406
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:53,640
their own

1407
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,520
in their own way of taking it off the

1408
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,480
the boundary but again

1409
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,599
I struggle with this I'm

1410
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,180
guilty as charged but I am I am what I'm

1411
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,099
trying to do is trying to come up with

1412
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:10,559
my own narrative so that what Chris is

1413
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,660
saying

1414
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:15,900
makes sense to me as opposed to make

1415
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,579
sense to the world which is what Chris

1416
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:20,099
is trying to do

1417
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:22,200
I'll try with another speculative

1418
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,880
fiction

1419
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,319
so

1420
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:27,359
um there's a screen

1421
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,880
between let's just say the stage and the

1422
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,680
audience or whatever it's a holographic

1423
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,799
screen and on each side of the screen

1424
01:00:33,799 --> 01:00:36,059
there's some

1425
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:38,460
embodied object

1426
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:42,180
so that means that it must have um Vault

1427
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,579
it's a volume and closing object because

1428
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:47,339
points and lines and planes are only

1429
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:49,619
abstractions every real physical object

1430
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:53,460
encloses volume and now a light is going

1431
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,180
to be coming from behind each object

1432
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:59,160
facing the screen and that's this kind

1433
01:00:59,160 --> 01:00:59,880
of

1434
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,579
uh cone that we're seeing from each side

1435
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:05,160
it's like the shadow cast by the object

1436
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,220
so if the object was a sphere then it

1437
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,700
would be projecting down to a circle

1438
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:15,839
onto the screen if the shape were a cube

1439
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:16,859
it could be

1440
01:01:16,859 --> 01:01:19,200
projecting down and so where the light

1441
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,760
is positioned

1442
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,180
is the um perspective that that

1443
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:29,339
cognitive entity is taking on its qrf

1444
01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:31,319
those lights could move so now we have

1445
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:32,880
the situation where the two spotlights

1446
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,920
are moving maybe the shapes are staying

1447
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,900
the same maybe they're changing too

1448
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,319
and it's like two searchlights scanning

1449
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,119
across this

1450
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,000
B oval

1451
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,660
and some sometimes they are perfectly

1452
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,640
locked I mean there could be a situation

1453
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,579
where they're perfectly aligned

1454
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:55,260
or there could be situations where

1455
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:59,040
they're totally disjoint

1456
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,920
um and each of those situations have

1457
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,260
different implications

1458
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,579
for

1459
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:10,740
what one entity sees

1460
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:14,220
when it looks at the screen maybe like

1461
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,440
the shadow is the only part where you

1462
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,579
can see

1463
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:19,920
because the rest of it is too blinding

1464
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,980
or something like that and so then if

1465
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,700
we're in case a here where

1466
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,339
um maybe B doesn't have a projection or

1467
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:31,859
maybe B's projections totally somewhere

1468
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:35,760
else then a is in this solipsistic I'm

1469
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,799
the active agent interacting within an

1470
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:40,020
art World setting

1471
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:43,220
and D is like

1472
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:46,619
potentially the

1473
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:50,160
um the computer Engineers classical

1474
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,760
dream or asymptote which is like all the

1475
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,700
data going through the USB cable is just

1476
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:01,140
being perfectly noiselessly received

1477
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,920
and then we also get these um B and C

1478
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,900
cases

1479
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:11,400
but a is kind of like the inner world

1480
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,859
D is like the

1481
01:03:13,859 --> 01:03:15,900
perfect Communication channel and then

1482
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,640
to connect it just to friston's concept

1483
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,859
of generalized synchrony as we've talked

1484
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:21,660
about many times generalized synchrony

1485
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:25,319
doesn't mean lockstep two agents could

1486
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:27,059
reduce their uncertainty about each

1487
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:29,339
other not by doing the same thing at

1488
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:31,799
every time step but for example by turn

1489
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:34,380
taking and I think that points the way

1490
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,260
to how we get reduction of variational

1491
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,420
free energy reduction of prediction

1492
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,680
error surprise and so on without

1493
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,260
especially spatial temporal enmeshment

1494
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,780
but not necessarily even informational

1495
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,720
identity in measurements because you

1496
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,220
could have two things that through their

1497
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,260
alignment

1498
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:58,380
become actually differentiated and that

1499
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,240
could increase the mutual information

1500
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,940
between two metronomes not just to have

1501
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,400
them going in the same direction but to

1502
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,260
have them going in in opposite

1503
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,359
directions the mutual information in

1504
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,240
those two settings is going to be high

1505
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,859
so it's not the case a generalized

1506
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:16,680
synchrony means that

1507
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,799
um things are becoming

1508
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:22,020
uh

1509
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,839
blurred

1510
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:27,480
we could actually also have integrated

1511
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,240
information through

1512
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,640
increased

1513
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:36,599
articulation not just decreased

1514
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:38,099
and then

1515
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:40,980
life finds a way or cognition finds a

1516
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,000
way

1517
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,599
on this trade-off Frontier of in our

1518
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,880
pursuit of unitarity

1519
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:53,160
will we blur to unify or will we

1520
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,579
differentiate to unify but those are the

1521
01:04:56,579 --> 01:05:00,119
paths we have we don't have the um

1522
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:03,380
backwards ratchet

1523
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,859
yeah

1524
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:08,058
yeah makes sense

1525
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:17,520
any other ladder slides enter

1526
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,000
uh no that's it uh so Chris made a few

1527
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,819
more remarks at the end about uh

1528
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:25,200
language

1529
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,460
here uh but you mentioned that he's

1530
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,740
gonna talk more about this in the coming

1531
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:36,140
lecture so we'll just leave it up to him

1532
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:42,359
yeah there could be some very

1533
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:45,000
powerful and interesting

1534
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,280
linguistic

1535
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,059
opportunities

1536
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:53,339
for updating

1537
01:05:53,339 --> 01:05:58,500
our speaking to reflect what we are

1538
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,420
learning

1539
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,579
here

1540
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:06,980
I don't know what those necessarily are

1541
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:10,799
whether it's a syntactic or a semantic

1542
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:13,020
thing or whether it's a narrative

1543
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,640
thing

1544
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,839
but how to actually re-enter

1545
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:22,859
some of these formalisms into our

1546
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:26,280
Focus understanding

1547
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:30,960
could just be immensely powerful and um

1548
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,920
we could have a lot of Integrity between

1549
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,980
the natural language way that

1550
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:40,799
potentially we're already showing up for

1551
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:41,960
engagement

1552
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:46,020
and some of these formalisms

1553
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,460
that

1554
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,380
gets a first principles about

1555
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,200
interacting entities and boundary

1556
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,220
conditions and all of that

1557
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:58,319
Dean any penultimate thoughts

1558
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,780
not really I I'm going to go back and

1559
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,000
listen to the

1560
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,500
I'm going to listen to Chris's comments

1561
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,020
again about this common cause and the

1562
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:08,700
fine-tuning Assumption and whether

1563
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,280
that's sort of a

1564
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,780
metaphorically a dialing in or what it

1565
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,720
what he means exactly by the fine tuning

1566
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,460
in the in the context of this

1567
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:20,339
conversation today what you just kind of

1568
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:22,200
said about are we dulling something here

1569
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,839
or are we sculpting something to make it

1570
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:27,119
more fittable

1571
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,079
like I'm going to go and now and go back

1572
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:33,119
and listen to what he talks about in

1573
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,460
terms of fine tuning and maybe update my

1574
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:38,839
priors around that so

1575
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,900
enter any last uh thoughts or maybe

1576
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,599
scroll over to the um schedule the

1577
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,640
course again just so we can close on

1578
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,819
that

1579
01:07:50,339 --> 01:07:53,220
yeah we're halfway through we just

1580
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:55,319
completed the third discussion section

1581
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:59,099
now so we've had three lectures and

1582
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:02,339
three discussions it's all downhill from

1583
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:03,720
here

1584
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,960
um by the way this was the first midterm

1585
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,660
you guys both did well

1586
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:13,140
um we're gonna head into four or like

1587
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,599
session four with these last three how

1588
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,339
agents use multiple communication

1589
01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:18,540
channels and that's going to get

1590
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:21,359
connected to the quantum fep how space

1591
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,939
time emerges from communication which is

1592
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:26,160
something that we've brought up a bunch

1593
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,140
it's been in the background but but

1594
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,759
making That explicit it's going to be

1595
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,759
exciting and then section six I think is

1596
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:34,198
just gonna be

1597
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:37,319
such a jumping off point

1598
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:39,540
because the scope

1599
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:43,560
and the intensity of what is transpiring

1600
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,120
is Extreme

1601
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,359
so connecting it to biology

1602
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:51,899
which is to say life more fully and

1603
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:56,339
where we go in in 23 and Beyond

1604
01:08:56,339 --> 01:08:58,380
that's going to be awesome so any last

1605
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,899
words Ender

1606
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:04,140
uh no I just think of what you said um

1607
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,000
very I would I would say it's going to

1608
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
be uphill in in terms of how interesting

1609
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,540
it's going to get

1610
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:17,819
cool well I encourage people to uh check

1611
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:19,080
out the

1612
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:22,198
course website and submit questions that

1613
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:23,520
they'd like to see addressed by Chris

1614
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,279
also to register and join these

1615
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:27,899
participatory discussions there'll be

1616
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:30,719
three more of them so if you want to

1617
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:34,198
join share your qrf

1618
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:36,719
be part of the publication of all of

1619
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,580
these works that will compile at the end

1620
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:41,719
and just get your

1621
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,859
exoskeleton in the game

1622
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:46,319
with what is happening here it'd be

1623
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,899
really awesome to hear more voices and

1624
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:52,198
and to have more on board

1625
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:55,679
okay thank you Dean and Andrew till next

1626
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,860
time
