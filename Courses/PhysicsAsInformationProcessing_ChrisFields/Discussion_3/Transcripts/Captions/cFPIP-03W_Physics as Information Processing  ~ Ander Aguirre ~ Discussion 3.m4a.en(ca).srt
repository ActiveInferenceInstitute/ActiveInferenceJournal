00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,938
Hello and welcome. It's July 29,

3
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:13,354
2023, and we're here in session

4
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:17,294
three discussion of the

5
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:19,354
course physics's Information Processing

6
00:00:19,402 --> 00:00:21,386
at the Active Inference Institute.

7
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:24,270
We're having a follow up discussion on

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,138
Chris Fields's third lecture on quantum

9
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,454
reference frames, and we're looking

10
00:00:30,492 --> 00:00:32,726
forward to your participation. So if

11
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:34,626
you're watching along live and you've

12
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:36,022
been invited to the calendar event,

13
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:38,546
it's not too late to jump in. If you're

14
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:41,334
watching on YouTube, you can write any

15
00:00:41,372 --> 00:00:44,738
questions or comments in the live chat

16
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:47,226
with Dean And. Ander here we're going to

17
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:50,730
be looking at some of the key points and

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,926
taking it in a few different directions,

19
00:00:54,118 --> 00:00:56,746
sharing our reference frames, making a

20
00:00:56,768 --> 00:00:59,742
shared one. So, Andrew, would be awesome

21
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:03,006
to have you zoom in a little bit on the

22
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:06,994
slide and then feel free to

23
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,860
take us through some of the key points

24
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,346
so that we can see a little bit how

25
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:16,242
you're seeing it. Thank you. That looks

26
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:20,142
good. Yes. Okay, so let's start by

27
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:24,374
reviewing the last lecture from

28
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:25,926
a couple of weeks ago, and then we can

29
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:27,670
open up the discussions. If there's any

30
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,218
questions that appear in the live chat,

31
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:32,460
we can address those. All right. So

32
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,690
lecture two, Chris introduced this idea

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,574
of the information processing

34
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:43,806
between system A and B, where they

35
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,446
interact via qubits on a boundary, and

36
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:52,000
they have reference frames that

37
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,906
give meaning to this communication. You

38
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:58,926
want to think of information processing

39
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:02,420
as a communication channel, the way

40
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,026
Shannon thought about it. So that was in

41
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:09,358
lecture two. And lecture three a couple

42
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:12,758
weeks ago tried to

43
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:15,858
make this more explicit by emphasizing

44
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:19,042
the idea that this has to be physically

45
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:22,474
embodied somewhere. Okay. And I

46
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:25,194
think that because we are so used to

47
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:28,986
information being fungible in

48
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:30,726
no small part because of the Internet

49
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:33,900
and everything, it's a little hard

50
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,814
to understand at first when the claim is

51
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,658
made that you have a QRF that it's non

52
00:02:39,674 --> 00:02:41,306
fungible or you have a piece of quantum

53
00:02:41,338 --> 00:02:42,942
information that's non fungible or

54
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,990
things like the no Cloning theorem.

55
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,074
We're so used to information being

56
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:49,220
fungible, to it being zeros and ones

57
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,538
that it's a bit of a

58
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:56,286
change in mindset at first, but that's

59
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,550
exactly what lecture three introduced.

60
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,438
This was all stuff, right? Could you

61
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:06,198
maybe just unpack that a little bit?

62
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:08,966
What would it mean for information to be

63
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,350
fungible? Or what's that stance like?

64
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,634
And then, what does it mean for

65
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:14,586
information to be non fungible? And what

66
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:18,314
is that stance like? Yeah, I'm out

67
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:21,498
to get there. So let me scroll down the

68
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:23,854
slides, because that's addressed here.

69
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:25,918
So maybe I should have kept this in the

70
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:28,654
beginning, but anyways, session two

71
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:30,554
talked about how information theory

72
00:03:30,602 --> 00:03:32,640
makes this simple and obvious. Okay.

73
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,706
And in session three, we talk about

74
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:39,582
reference frames and mechanistically,

75
00:03:39,646 --> 00:03:40,980
how all of this works.

76
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,754
So, yeah, let's address that question of

77
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,760
the difference between

78
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,278
hold on 1 second. Let me use my mouse to

79
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:53,320
scroll down here.

80
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,960
Okay, so that's a little faster. Right.

81
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,886
Okay. Can you restate

82
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:04,826
your question, Daniel? Yeah. What would

83
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:07,430
it mean for information to be fungible

84
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,138
or non fungible? People might be

85
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:11,814
familiar with that in the economic

86
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:13,918
setting with non fungible tokens and all

87
00:04:13,924 --> 00:04:15,454
of that, but what are we talking about

88
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:19,374
with informational fungibility? I think

89
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:23,582
it basically comes down to whether

90
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:24,854
you can replicate. I mean, it's

91
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:26,194
basically the difference between

92
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,746
classical and quantum information. As

93
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,778
far as I know, fungible information

94
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:33,282
is everything that you can basically

95
00:04:33,336 --> 00:04:35,460
turn into a message of zeros and ones.

96
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,382
How you transmit it may be different,

97
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:43,526
the channel, the physical hardware and

98
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:45,640
so on. But at the end of the day,

99
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,958
it's something that you can write on a

100
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:50,098
boundary and something that you can

101
00:04:50,284 --> 00:04:52,166
transmit at zeros and ones. Whereas

102
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:53,180
quantum information,

103
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,934
you literally have to send the hardware,

104
00:04:56,982 --> 00:05:00,090
the piece of hardware, the QRF. At least

105
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,942
that's how I understand it. So a simple

106
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:06,334
answer might be that

107
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,486
it's information encoded in a piece of

108
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,114
software versus a piece of hardware.

109
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,342
But I don't think that analogy is

110
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,738
perfect. Yeah. Dean, what do you

111
00:05:16,744 --> 00:05:20,754
think? Here's what I'm curious about.

112
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:23,106
And again, you guys can help me with

113
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:25,810
this. As opposed to reference frames, I

114
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,314
oftentimes default to

115
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:30,866
frame of reference. And I know that in

116
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:32,886
one of the live streams, what I tried to

117
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:34,998
bring out was the idea that there was an

118
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:37,122
ice cream cone looking at an ice cream

119
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,350
truck. And the question was always

120
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,042
whether or not which one of those two

121
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,274
entities, one is in the foreground and

122
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,794
one is in the background. And in this

123
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:50,540
slide that Ander has up the question is,

124
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,630
is the non fungibility because only

125
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,806
A and B can decide whether the

126
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:03,790
VA as seen by B, the A is deeper

127
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,446
into that image based on our frame

128
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,634
of reference. And the B is closer or is

129
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,434
the B the one that's actually deeper and

130
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:16,146
the A is the one that's in the

131
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,210
foreground? And I was wondering whether

132
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,382
the idea of non copyability is because

133
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:24,774
of that depth of field aspect that

134
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:27,026
cannot be determined unless it's

135
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:30,614
literally handed over the way that Chris

136
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:33,526
was describing it. I think that's

137
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:38,246
basically think I'm

138
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:39,306
not sure that I can answer your

139
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:41,878
question, but I think I have the feeling

140
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:45,118
that Chris well, Chris said this in the

141
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,606
lecture, that at the end of the day,

142
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:49,834
the KrF is somewhere

143
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:51,840
in your nervous system.

144
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,254
And here whether you bring

145
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:57,746
up a good point. Right. It looks like

146
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:00,414
this slide is a bit of an optical

147
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,650
illusion. Whether you see A or B deeper,

148
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,706
I guess it depends on something going on

149
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:10,006
inside your head. This picture is so

150
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:12,246
symmetrical that if you focus enough on

151
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:14,310
it, you can change your opinion.

152
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,346
Just to even connect that to what we're

153
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:21,382
talking about. The classical fungible

154
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:23,626
information on the Holographic screen,

155
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:26,134
on the blanket, and then the quantum

156
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:29,610
cognitive rotation is those two images

157
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,142
are on the screen identical. And then

158
00:07:34,196 --> 00:07:37,182
whether it gets a quantum rotation such

159
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:41,278
that the three points of the axes are

160
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:44,414
closer to us than the intersection on

161
00:07:44,452 --> 00:07:46,546
that kind of tetrahedron or the other

162
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:48,226
way around, whether the ballerina is

163
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:50,494
rotating one way or the other, that's

164
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:53,250
not on the boundary. So the information

165
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,106
about the depth of field is part of

166
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:59,318
the QRF or part of the enactment of the

167
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:02,326
QRF, and it's not written on the

168
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,190
boundary.

169
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,080
And that goes back to the preparation

170
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,100
question and not just the measuring.

171
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,744
Yeah. Like if the preparation if your

172
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:14,872
whole enculturation or the last five

173
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:18,104
minutes it was entrained, or you were

174
00:08:18,142 --> 00:08:20,920
holding an object, that predisposed you

175
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,416
to think that the vertex of the

176
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:26,324
intersection was further away, that's

177
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,068
the preparation sets your prior so that

178
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:31,496
when you get this ambiguous artifact,

179
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:34,860
you rotate it into the most natural

180
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,080
position. Cognitively.

181
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,096
And that's the preparation that sets you

182
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,696
up for a measurement. No measurement can

183
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:44,528
happen without a preparation. What do

184
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:47,970
you think, Andrew? Sure.

185
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,630
Yeah. Everything you said makes sense.

186
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,788
So perhaps let

187
00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:58,356
me recall what was that around the

188
00:08:58,378 --> 00:09:01,896
slides in this

189
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,890
whole spirit or philosophy of making,

190
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,016
emphasizing that information is

191
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:10,570
physical, it concubine this whole thing.

192
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,596
One of the glaring omissions in

193
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:19,310
physics was the embodiment of

194
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,344
the reference frame, which was treated

195
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:25,512
as an abstraction in classical

196
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:28,832
physics, such as by Galileo, but maybe

197
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:31,936
even Einstein, even if he my hunch, is

198
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,000
that he did have more of this instinct

199
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,112
know, particularly in all those thought

200
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,888
experiments of trying to chase the

201
00:09:37,974 --> 00:09:40,732
library. You are chasing the library.

202
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:44,640
Right. So at the end of the I mean,

203
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,644
this is the whole process of making the

204
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:48,148
observer and the reference frame more

205
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,004
and more explicit and more and more

206
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:52,296
physical. Because at the end of the day,

207
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:56,024
it has to right. If you start

208
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,956
with this assumption, that solipsistic

209
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:03,096
assumption almost, that all you

210
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:06,508
see is part of the same

211
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:09,964
material ether that you are,

212
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:13,816
then you are part of the universe

213
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:16,204
and you're observing something that is

214
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:19,848
out there. So you need to include a

215
00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:21,536
theory of what it means for you to be

216
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:23,456
observing that. Right. And at the end of

217
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:25,104
the day, the observer has to be

218
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:28,256
physical. That's what was emphasized by

219
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:30,256
Chris at the beginning of this lecture.

220
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,296
So this jump from treating the reference

221
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:36,036
frame as an abstraction to a real

222
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:37,140
physical entity,

223
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,008
these people have talked a lot

224
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:50,036
about in these papers that are quoted

225
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:53,676
there. But I should also remark, if

226
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:56,476
folks want to see this, it's coming up

227
00:10:56,498 --> 00:11:00,876
in high energy theory. Also in

228
00:11:00,898 --> 00:11:03,004
recent work of Saskind and others,

229
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,664
where they talk about quantum reference

230
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:07,848
frames very explicitly. So I don't

231
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:09,792
have the citations off the button, but

232
00:11:09,846 --> 00:11:11,872
it's definitely becoming an important

233
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:14,716
thing in the last 20 years, this attempt

234
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:17,244
to really explicitly treat the reference

235
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:19,088
frame and the observer as a quantum

236
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:21,940
entity, as a physical entity.

237
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,176
Okay, so that's

238
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,784
what I just said the jump from treating

239
00:11:28,832 --> 00:11:31,624
things reference rims as abstractions to

240
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:34,330
physical objects go.

241
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,792
And because

242
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:44,584
we cannot make a perfect copy of quantum

243
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:46,892
information, we say that these are

244
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:50,750
unique and clonable and unfungible. So

245
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,312
in order to recreate an experiment

246
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:57,696
perfectly, this is addressed as a part

247
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,508
of fungibility or not. Right. Can Alice,

248
00:12:00,604 --> 00:12:03,004
if you have some sort of quantum

249
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:05,424
experiment and Alice and, you know,

250
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:09,012
it's the usual DPR thought

251
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:11,024
experiment or whatever, alice and Bob

252
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:14,150
are separated by light years.

253
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,136
Is it enough, if they want to recreate

254
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:20,564
the same, exact same experiment for

255
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:23,850
Alice to send string of zeros and ones?

256
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,688
Well, if you had an experiment where

257
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:30,056
that's enough, then you can recreate it

258
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,904
with fungible information. If not, then

259
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:34,824
you need to somehow send non fungible

260
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:37,096
information, which really implies

261
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:38,860
sending a piece of hardware.

262
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,466
Can I add another piece here on the

263
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:51,022
previous slide? So this

264
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:54,750
looks really technical and scientific,

265
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,586
but let's think about Alice's

266
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:59,562
laboratory. Is Alice's brain,

267
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:02,994
mind and Bob's analogously? Alice is

268
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,794
thinking about what to say and then says

269
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:08,690
it. And that information might be

270
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,154
written in a chat form. It might be said

271
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:12,814
verbally, it might be transmitted

272
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:16,534
through digital or analog signal. But at

273
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,262
some point it's going through this

274
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:20,166
classical informational interface. And

275
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:22,866
then Bob's laboratory is like perceiving

276
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:25,782
and unpacking it. And the question of

277
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:28,742
semantic alignment is such that if Alice

278
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:31,782
gives a shopping list of ten items,

279
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,914
if there's semantic alignment, bob would

280
00:13:33,952 --> 00:13:36,154
be able to go to the store and then find

281
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:39,002
those ten items. And it made me think of

282
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:42,174
the dictionary definition of left and

283
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:43,854
right. So this gets back to our

284
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:46,254
discussion of whether the vertex on

285
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,846
these axes is coming towards us or away

286
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:51,034
from us. So I looked up the dictionary

287
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:54,882
definition of left on towards or

288
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:57,186
relating to the side of a human body or

289
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,634
of a thing that is to the west when the

290
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,158
person or that thing is facing north.

291
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:04,754
So that's, I guess, one attempt to

292
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,886
anchor what it means to be left. The

293
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:09,158
second definition is the left hand part

294
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:11,074
side or direction. And you could imagine

295
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:12,694
there's an analogous definition for

296
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:16,230
right. The point is you can't describe

297
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,602
verbally leftness and rightness or

298
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:23,882
chirality in general because its

299
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:26,890
reference is an embodied perspective.

300
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,918
And so if Alice said, okay, you're going

301
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:31,774
to go down the street and then turn left

302
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:35,754
at the stop sign, how would Alice

303
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:40,262
communicate to Bob what leftness meant

304
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:43,010
at that stop sign versus rightness?

305
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,250
And that's this question of flipping.

306
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,822
And the way that the quantum formalism

307
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:52,254
accommodates that is through the WIC

308
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:55,526
rotation and the quantum cognitive event

309
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,106
where the fungible transmittable

310
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:02,754
holographic information gets rotated

311
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:06,266
into the imaginary axis with the

312
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:09,126
formalisms that enable it to be rotated

313
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,998
at all. But that means you could rotate

314
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:13,500
it left quote or rotate it right.

315
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,214
Yeah, I think that's a very good

316
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,486
explanation. I don't know if I have much

317
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:23,440
to add. Dean you wanted to say.

318
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,710
Can'T. I don't know the answer to this,

319
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,986
but to take what Daniel just said, to

320
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:35,682
take the basic concept of being able

321
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:38,994
to take something that,

322
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:41,758
for all intents and purposes, can appear

323
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:44,934
one way or another and then turn that

324
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:47,714
into how Chris closed the last lecture

325
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:51,846
with we are seeing ourselves as both

326
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:56,554
being entangled and also being

327
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:59,670
separatable. How did we go literally

328
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,362
from a three dimension vertex to

329
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:08,382
we're both entangled and we're not

330
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:11,006
living in a paradox. That's just the way

331
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:15,034
it is. We're also removing

332
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:17,406
ourselves or separating ourselves at the

333
00:16:17,428 --> 00:16:19,518
same time. That's what I would like to

334
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:23,602
know, because somewhere between three

335
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:27,154
arbitrary lines and complexity is

336
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:30,146
not a paradox. Something has to be

337
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:32,514
happening, and I'm not exactly sure how

338
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:34,760
that transition plays out.

339
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,412
Anybody want to enlighten me? Can you

340
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:45,116
repeat your question, please? Well, how

341
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:48,656
do we go at this point of the

342
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:52,130
reference frame description of saying,

343
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,144
you can't copy it, all you can do is

344
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,016
pass it? Because we

345
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:03,270
think things could be flipped based on

346
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,096
internal reference frames, internal

347
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:09,044
meanings and internal models. The thing

348
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:10,976
we choose for context. Yada yada yada

349
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:13,416
yada goes all the way out to the

350
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:18,212
conclusion of Chris's conversation

351
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:21,850
with us in number three, where he said,

352
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,560
bottom line is that it's not a paradox

353
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,012
that as things become more and more

354
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:34,284
complex, then it

355
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:36,216
wants to get to a place of entanglement,

356
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:39,740
alignment, a sense of agreement,

357
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,204
and at the same time wants to remain

358
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:45,490
separate. So between those two things,

359
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,376
a whole lot has happened. And I

360
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:51,396
don't think we've skipped over it, but

361
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:54,244
we certainly haven't opened it up and

362
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,816
really looked at it closely. And I'm

363
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:59,684
just curious what's in between those two

364
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:03,536
scales. I agree. I think we're

365
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:05,848
going to cover that towards the end of

366
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:09,816
the talk, but I agree. I don't know how

367
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,064
you see this related to QRS or the stuff

368
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:14,868
we just talked about, but I think it's

369
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:16,664
the big question in this lecture,

370
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:18,556
right, that was like, where does this

371
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:22,200
tension between increasing complexity

372
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,800
and wanting to predict

373
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,724
what the environment is doing? One

374
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:30,416
requires entanglement and the other one

375
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:31,952
requires separability, at least

376
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:35,104
colloquially speaking, I think this

377
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:39,264
tension is basically

378
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:40,976
what the free energy principle comes

379
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:42,176
down to. Right. Daniel, what do you

380
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:45,268
think? You have the free energy and you

381
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:48,496
have the E minus TS. One is prediction

382
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,816
error. I mean, not exactly E minus TS.

383
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:52,580
Right? That would be thermodynamics but

384
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,964
you know what I mean. One is prediction

385
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:58,250
error and the other one is what was?

386
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,650
I can remember.

387
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,064
I'll definitely look forward to the

388
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,404
technical unpacking that you'll get to

389
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:09,896
soon, but I was reminded of the William

390
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:13,004
Blake quotation, do what you will. This

391
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:15,164
life's a fiction and is made up of

392
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:18,572
contradiction. So let's modify

393
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:21,760
that project what you will,

394
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,864
rotate what you will, spacetime's a

395
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:27,616
fiction. Not that it's false, but that

396
00:19:27,638 --> 00:19:30,304
it's a projected fictionalization that

397
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:32,464
it doesn't have the ontological primacy

398
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:34,980
that the topology of communication does

399
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,780
and is made up of contradiction. Yes.

400
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,070
And it's made up of this tension between

401
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,904
fitting and not overfitting, between

402
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,748
aligning and the principle of unitarity

403
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:52,792
and differentiating and becoming through

404
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:54,776
others. We become ourselves and that

405
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,840
type of articulation and recognizing

406
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,532
that two complementary forces like

407
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:05,096
convex and concave come into existence

408
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:09,984
at once. Like a zero to two jump is

409
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:13,440
not an issue or a stumbling block.

410
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,544
It's that we wouldn't have it any other

411
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:20,210
way. Couldn't have it any other way.

412
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,588
Yeah, sure, we'll get that. Towards the

413
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:27,108
end, you can almost even call it a

414
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:30,148
duality. It's not far fetched. I mean,

415
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:32,036
it's the sort of thing that I think most

416
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:33,316
people will be happy to take for

417
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:36,296
granted. Such supersymmetry like you

418
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,856
have two kinds of particles, but the

419
00:20:38,878 --> 00:20:41,208
same amount of them, and dualities that

420
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:45,108
are all over the place. So I think it's

421
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:47,244
not unreasonable to just accept that

422
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:49,656
there is a tension between increasing

423
00:20:49,688 --> 00:20:53,148
complexity, which you want A and

424
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:55,944
B to be separable for, and accuracy

425
00:20:55,992 --> 00:20:59,070
prediction. Now, how this is related to

426
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,884
emergent space and these

427
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:07,552
QRS stuff, I don't want to make very far

428
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:09,056
fetched claims. We'll talk about

429
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:12,516
emergent space later on the course. But

430
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,532
for now, let's say a few more words

431
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:16,550
about QRFs and then we'll get to the

432
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,190
complexity stuff towards the end.

433
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,536
QRFs are almost building blocks, if you

434
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,320
want, for information processing

435
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,996
here, it's very useful to recall

436
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:36,270
definition that I feel I think we have

437
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,716
mentioned before of information as being

438
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:42,684
differences that make a difference.

439
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:45,032
That's probably the best colloquial

440
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:47,772
definition of information I've heard.

441
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:50,368
And I think it does a lot of work. I

442
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:52,304
mean, it's almost mathematical, but

443
00:21:52,342 --> 00:21:53,984
anyways, we need to unpack it a little

444
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:57,488
more and see. So for a difference to

445
00:21:57,494 --> 00:22:00,736
make a difference, what do you want out

446
00:22:00,758 --> 00:22:03,876
of QRF? Right. Unsurprisingly, I mean,

447
00:22:03,898 --> 00:22:07,188
not surprisingly, but reassuringly, I

448
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:08,470
think would be the word.

449
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,160
You need a QRF to have sensory action

450
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,624
and a default state,

451
00:22:19,742 --> 00:22:23,688
right? This is sort of like where your

452
00:22:23,774 --> 00:22:26,336
Bayesian prior distribution is encoded.

453
00:22:26,468 --> 00:22:28,956
These three things will give you a

454
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:31,308
building block for any information

455
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:34,584
processing. And that ties

456
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:37,564
together with all the work in the free

457
00:22:37,602 --> 00:22:42,012
energy literature and perception action

458
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:44,240
loops and whatnot.

459
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,704
So before we see mathematically how

460
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:52,532
a TRF is defined, I think it's more

461
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:54,820
illustrative. And I think Chris went

462
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,284
exactly on the right order when he

463
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:59,030
presented this a couple weeks ago,

464
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,444
seeing examples from h.

465
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:05,716
These are actual pieces of hardware that

466
00:23:05,738 --> 00:23:09,332
are effectively QRX, and it's remarkable

467
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:12,660
how they map to well. I'll skip

468
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,560
ahead a little bit. But when you get to

469
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,396
the mathematical definition of a QRF as

470
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:22,076
a quantum system that you

471
00:23:22,098 --> 00:23:25,144
can specify with this category theory

472
00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:27,788
diagram, you have incoming arrows into a

473
00:23:27,794 --> 00:23:29,980
node that then expands. Right? And this

474
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,744
roughly corresponds to measurement and

475
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:34,608
preparation degrees of not degrees of

476
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,256
freedom, degrees of freedom would be the

477
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:38,096
same, right, when you attach it to the

478
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:40,016
boundary. But measurement and

479
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:41,780
preparation stages, I guess, would be

480
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,568
the better word. But anyways,

481
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:47,904
let me go back to these examples,

482
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:50,416
right? And Daniel, you're the biologist

483
00:23:50,448 --> 00:23:52,692
here, so correct me if I say anything

484
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:56,152
wrong here. You have a

485
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:58,856
cartoon picture of a bacteria, I think,

486
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,536
and this is a very simple sort

487
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:04,376
of thing, right? It navigates in the

488
00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:08,716
direction of food and

489
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:12,380
that's it, right? So it is a very simple

490
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,644
rudimentary example of a cureb. You have

491
00:24:15,762 --> 00:24:21,324
the sensory stage

492
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:23,536
here, I guess the degrees of freedom. I

493
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:26,816
guess the degrees of freedom. It's not

494
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:28,432
obvious here what the boundary is,

495
00:24:28,486 --> 00:24:32,036
that's one thing. But it

496
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:33,636
is a good enough picture to see the

497
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:36,036
resemblance to here we have the

498
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,896
measurement which in this case you're

499
00:24:38,928 --> 00:24:41,716
trying to measure concentration of food.

500
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,970
You have your node here,

501
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,292
C, which is your prior

502
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:52,490
distribution for concentration of food.

503
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,968
And finally you have the output, the

504
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:58,988
preparation stage, which is the

505
00:24:58,994 --> 00:25:00,892
rest of this chemical network that will

506
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:04,344
control and steer this bacteria,

507
00:25:04,392 --> 00:25:07,164
right? So there is here you want to call

508
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:10,544
it the action degrees of freedom that

509
00:25:10,582 --> 00:25:12,576
will steer this bacteria in the

510
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:15,232
direction of food. And likewise with

511
00:25:15,286 --> 00:25:16,864
cell division, this I understand even

512
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:18,944
less that the network appears more

513
00:25:18,982 --> 00:25:22,324
complicated. But I think it's fair to

514
00:25:22,362 --> 00:25:24,436
say that at the end of the day, all

515
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:27,904
these chemical networks that appear

516
00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:31,556
super complicated somehow have

517
00:25:31,578 --> 00:25:35,604
to be mapped to this category

518
00:25:35,652 --> 00:25:38,536
theoretical diagram. That's all there is

519
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:41,140
to it. You're going to have the sensory

520
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,224
input and the action output and

521
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:47,848
you're going to have the default

522
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:51,132
chemical concentration which amounts to

523
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:52,750
this node over here.

524
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,424
You remember this from last lecture,

525
00:25:58,472 --> 00:26:00,764
right, Daniel? Yeah. And the Cone Co

526
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:03,708
cone we explored also in live stream 17

527
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:06,080
on the Bayesian semantic information

528
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,736
flow. But I'll kind of add a point about

529
00:26:08,758 --> 00:26:12,788
these biological systems in relationship

530
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:16,548
to artificially specified systems and

531
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:18,532
what that helps us understand about

532
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:21,092
perception, cognition, action. So the

533
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,596
cone COCONE diagram has this bow tie

534
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,576
architecture or this kind of like two

535
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:30,600
pyramids touching point to point where

536
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,860
there's a preparation and a measurement

537
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,032
which can be different dimensionalities

538
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:40,156
or different scopes. Like it could be

539
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:42,504
multi input, multi output or multi

540
00:26:42,552 --> 00:26:44,796
input, single output, vice versa and so

541
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:49,228
on. But they come through this eye

542
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:52,272
of the needle with C prime here. Now,

543
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:54,400
contrast that kind of architecture

544
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,376
represented here abstractly, with what

545
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:01,300
we see in the bacterial process and in

546
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,350
the cell division process.

547
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,912
These have that kind of a bow tie

548
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:09,248
perception, cognition, action

549
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:12,400
architecture or measurement, cognitive

550
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,680
integration, preparation architecture.

551
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,456
In contrast, we see, for example, an

552
00:27:20,478 --> 00:27:23,272
artificial neural network where the

553
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:26,508
input and the output layers are usually

554
00:27:26,594 --> 00:27:30,124
lower dimensional, maybe an image coming

555
00:27:30,162 --> 00:27:32,876
in with several hundred pixels and a

556
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:35,196
single output like a classifier coming

557
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:37,592
out the other end, but a dimensional

558
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,604
explosion in those internal cognitive

559
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:44,204
layers. But in biological systems.

560
00:27:44,332 --> 00:27:46,816
It's actually exactly the opposite. For

561
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:49,376
example, many, many receptors on the

562
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:51,984
cell surface, on the holographic

563
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:54,564
boundary, the sensorium of the cell.

564
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:57,316
But then there are these common

565
00:27:57,418 --> 00:28:01,168
secondary messengers that many pathways

566
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:04,564
converge upon. So that reflects

567
00:28:04,612 --> 00:28:06,570
the kind of radically different

568
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,000
architecture that a QRF embodies,

569
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,408
as opposed to the approach taken by

570
00:28:14,494 --> 00:28:17,416
disembodied intelligence frameworks

571
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:19,736
which use dimensional explosion

572
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:23,496
internally to try to categorize

573
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:27,192
and classify and find edge cases versus

574
00:28:27,256 --> 00:28:30,176
this dimensional winnowing that is

575
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:32,044
reflective of these embodied

576
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:33,040
intelligences.

577
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,444
And if I may make a tangential comment

578
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:41,476
here also, I think the good thing about

579
00:28:41,498 --> 00:28:43,380
these two examples is that they also

580
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,990
showcase the fact of how

581
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,004
the deep implications of scale free

582
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:53,416
biology, if you want to call it this

583
00:28:53,438 --> 00:28:56,168
way. We tend to think of these sorts of

584
00:28:56,174 --> 00:29:00,760
processes such as here only

585
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,996
happening at the level of the nervous

586
00:29:03,028 --> 00:29:05,896
system in animals, or as you said,

587
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:07,436
neural networks. Right. We tend to

588
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:09,420
associate this with neural networks.

589
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,316
And perhaps evolution has tiered us in a

590
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:16,024
way that endowed us with nervous systems

591
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:17,676
to make these things. Maybe these are

592
00:29:17,698 --> 00:29:21,390
higher up in the layers, but really

593
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,884
that's a bit of an arbitrary distinction

594
00:29:23,932 --> 00:29:26,528
that we make. The processes going on at

595
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:28,908
the cellular level, even if they don't

596
00:29:28,924 --> 00:29:30,384
appear to have anything to do with

597
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:33,990
nervous system. My understanding is that

598
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,516
there are some generic properties that

599
00:29:38,538 --> 00:29:40,388
are the same and everything that has to

600
00:29:40,394 --> 00:29:42,644
do with information processing, it

601
00:29:42,682 --> 00:29:45,976
manifests maybe slightly different when

602
00:29:45,998 --> 00:29:49,176
it comes to explicit neurons, but at the

603
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:51,476
end of the day, it's the same generic

604
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:53,156
process going on. Would you say? That's

605
00:29:53,188 --> 00:29:54,360
right, Daniel?

606
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,148
The ontological claim is that it's the

607
00:29:59,154 --> 00:30:01,896
same generic process happening, whereas

608
00:30:01,928 --> 00:30:04,700
the more instrumentalist claim is that

609
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,352
we can model it with some shared

610
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:08,540
abstractions.

611
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,128
Yeah. Okay, so we can continue.

612
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:21,696
Right? So from,

613
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:23,828
you know, I don't have a whole lot to

614
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:26,708
say. Daniel said quite a bit about at

615
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:28,180
the end of the day, QRF,

616
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,564
you can visualize it as this diagram and

617
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:35,736
you can think of it as if you are more

618
00:30:35,758 --> 00:30:37,956
familiar with the picture of a neural

619
00:30:37,988 --> 00:30:40,008
network and ways on a neural network and

620
00:30:40,014 --> 00:30:43,210
so on. That's the way to think about it.

621
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,904
Now, let's continue with explicit

622
00:30:46,952 --> 00:30:50,456
embodiment, if you wish. So QRFs

623
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:54,750
in the formalism have to be attached to

624
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,460
a boundary boundary degrees of freedom.

625
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,170
And I should add another remark here,

626
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,424
and personally to me also, the hard part

627
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:08,896
about this quantum free

628
00:31:08,918 --> 00:31:10,736
energy principle, formalism, if you

629
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:13,048
wish, is what you said at the beginning

630
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:14,432
is the fact that it's topological,

631
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:16,356
right? So very often it's not clear what

632
00:31:16,378 --> 00:31:18,196
the boundary degrees of freedom are.

633
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,084
Right? Because we tend to think of

634
00:31:20,122 --> 00:31:24,276
boundaries as geometrical

635
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:27,076
and certainly the classical FEP treats

636
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:30,168
them as geometrical. But that's not the

637
00:31:30,174 --> 00:31:32,136
case here in the quantum free energy

638
00:31:32,318 --> 00:31:36,260
formalism where we have emergent space

639
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,180
will be talked about in later sessions.

640
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,156
But that's just like one quick remark to

641
00:31:42,178 --> 00:31:45,230
make at the end of the day, though,

642
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,748
even if it's topological, we're going to

643
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:51,630
have real degrees of freedom that this

644
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,564
URF is attaching to this cone cocoon

645
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:58,496
diagram. And you're going to have

646
00:31:58,518 --> 00:32:00,400
measurement operators that yield

647
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,452
classical outcomes plus

648
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,670
and minus one.

649
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,740
And then you can think of this QRF

650
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,476
or more abstractly, this concoction

651
00:32:15,508 --> 00:32:18,330
diagram as a neural network, if it was

652
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,056
acting on those Ander qubits and

653
00:32:22,078 --> 00:32:24,920
then back propagating some sort of

654
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,780
action signal preparation.

655
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,110
Okay,

656
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,768
let's not forget that Lambdawer's

657
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:39,484
principle and so on requires

658
00:32:39,612 --> 00:32:41,680
that we are mindful of energy

659
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,456
constraints on computation. And that

660
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:48,320
gives us the following picture.

661
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,708
Number one, we're going to have to use

662
00:32:56,794 --> 00:33:00,196
energy from the environment to

663
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:02,772
fuel our computation, to fuel our

664
00:33:02,826 --> 00:33:05,192
observation. That means that right away

665
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:07,336
you cannot use the entirety of your

666
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:10,090
boundary to gather information.

667
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,824
It necessitates an

668
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:19,612
allocation of resources. Right here,

669
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:22,844
E is the observed environment, and the

670
00:33:22,882 --> 00:33:24,904
blue portion is A, thermodynamical

671
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:28,104
sector where you extract free

672
00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:31,584
energy and dump heat in order

673
00:33:31,622 --> 00:33:33,856
to run this computational process. And

674
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:37,324
then furthermore, you can have a memory

675
00:33:37,372 --> 00:33:38,896
sector where you write things on a

676
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:41,220
boundary, and this takes up energy.

677
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,316
Also, writing information onto the

678
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:45,156
boundary by Landauer's Principle will

679
00:33:45,178 --> 00:33:49,024
take up information. And Chris

680
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:50,180
called this the minimal interesting

681
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,764
observer because it has a memory

682
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:57,668
sector, and quite minimal

683
00:33:57,764 --> 00:34:00,810
here implies that we have at least

684
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,216
minimal interesting implies that we have

685
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:07,756
more than one layer here. The process of

686
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:11,496
writing things into a memory sector

687
00:34:11,688 --> 00:34:14,556
requires us to have a clock so that we

688
00:34:14,578 --> 00:34:17,820
can label those memories in time.

689
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,096
Okay, so we do have time as part of this

690
00:34:20,118 --> 00:34:23,776
formalism, just not space yet. Time has

691
00:34:23,798 --> 00:34:26,960
to be internal to the observer.

692
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,380
Just one piece on that that Chris

693
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,076
mentioned. And as you

694
00:34:35,178 --> 00:34:38,752
echoed, time here is an attribute

695
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:42,196
of some cognitive systems in

696
00:34:42,218 --> 00:34:45,412
terms of their internal understanding

697
00:34:45,556 --> 00:34:48,792
so that they can sort memories and

698
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:51,370
understand what came earlier or later.

699
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,164
It's not something that's a priori

700
00:34:54,212 --> 00:34:57,452
defined externally, which is the case in

701
00:34:57,506 --> 00:35:00,188
the kind of spacetime first. Now, how do

702
00:35:00,194 --> 00:35:03,656
we fit communication into here? We flip

703
00:35:03,688 --> 00:35:06,844
that we're talking about the topology of

704
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:09,528
communication as ontologically,

705
00:35:09,704 --> 00:35:12,844
primal and now certain kinds of

706
00:35:12,882 --> 00:35:14,912
sophisticated agents. This is not like

707
00:35:14,966 --> 00:35:16,656
necessarily true of a rock or a

708
00:35:16,678 --> 00:35:19,728
metronome or a particle of a gas, but

709
00:35:19,814 --> 00:35:23,044
some kinds of cognitive systems are such

710
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:25,684
that they are able to generate an

711
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:29,616
internal clock concept. And that doesn't

712
00:35:29,648 --> 00:35:31,456
have to be the same thing as what's

713
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:33,544
happening on the wall with Kronos. This

714
00:35:33,582 --> 00:35:35,688
can reflect a purely internal time

715
00:35:35,774 --> 00:35:38,024
kairos that enables observers or

716
00:35:38,062 --> 00:35:39,716
interactors that have different clock

717
00:35:39,748 --> 00:35:41,636
structures. And then Landauer's

718
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:45,130
principle helps us arbitrage or connect

719
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,060
the informational demands to the

720
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,072
energetic or the metabolic demands.

721
00:35:50,136 --> 00:35:53,916
Dean so when I

722
00:35:53,938 --> 00:35:57,436
first listened to the lecture, I thought

723
00:35:57,618 --> 00:36:01,330
when the term or phrase trade off

724
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,236
was raised, I traditionally

725
00:36:06,268 --> 00:36:07,776
have thought of trade off as kind of a

726
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,690
binary. If I'm picking this,

727
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,876
I'm trading off against all the other

728
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:17,300
things that I didn't pick. So one

729
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:22,324
or the other or others plural. But when

730
00:36:22,362 --> 00:36:24,656
I saw this, and especially when I heard

731
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:27,684
it in the context of things like degrees

732
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:31,432
of freedom, I began to wonder whether it

733
00:36:31,486 --> 00:36:34,344
is because it could sit on either side

734
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:36,280
of that boundary. It could be a priori

735
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,516
or it could be ad hoc or post hoc, a

736
00:36:39,538 --> 00:36:43,870
trade off which prior to

737
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,516
this conversation, I just assumed that a

738
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,624
trade off was one or the other.

739
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:54,450
But essentially what this implies is.

740
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,684
It'S. Still a kind of a degree of how

741
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:04,052
much weight you put into it and then

742
00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:06,420
you kind of cross a threshold and then

743
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,136
you've made your pick, you've completed

744
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:12,230
your trade off. Or again,

745
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,084
did I misinterpret what I was hearing?

746
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:20,090
If it's topological as opposed to

747
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,660
the more conventional spacetime

748
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,640
perspective,

749
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,132
can a trade off be both ad hoc and post

750
00:37:29,186 --> 00:37:32,030
hoc, seemingly at the same time?

751
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,944
Very interesting question. Let us just

752
00:37:40,982 --> 00:37:44,436
let it float and continue on enter. All

753
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:46,390
right. Because again,

754
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,270
I'll just say this. If it can be,

755
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,916
that would really move us out of the

756
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:59,380
classical realm that would essentially

757
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,616
say that anytime we've made a pick, we

758
00:38:02,638 --> 00:38:04,996
really haven't made a pick. There's

759
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:06,536
still a whole bunch of other things that

760
00:38:06,558 --> 00:38:10,172
are going to happen that

761
00:38:10,226 --> 00:38:13,464
can change whatever that action

762
00:38:13,512 --> 00:38:16,764
is that we thought we carried out or

763
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:19,672
enacted. If we're talking about an

764
00:38:19,746 --> 00:38:23,330
internal, internality state,

765
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,504
which is what I think we want, I think

766
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:29,680
we want to be able to change our minds.

767
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,700
Let me take that one way. Dean.

768
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,624
The analytical equations of the Action

769
00:38:40,672 --> 00:38:44,912
perception loop don't tell us in

770
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:47,048
implementation like if we're going to

771
00:38:47,054 --> 00:38:51,384
write it in code, whether we should use

772
00:38:51,502 --> 00:38:55,060
Action first procedurally

773
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,880
to update our observations,

774
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,396
or whether we enable our observations to

775
00:39:02,498 --> 00:39:06,152
wag the dog and then select Action

776
00:39:06,216 --> 00:39:07,708
at the end of the loop. So is it a

777
00:39:07,714 --> 00:39:09,276
perception action loop or is it an

778
00:39:09,298 --> 00:39:13,228
action perception loop? And those enable

779
00:39:13,404 --> 00:39:17,024
a kind of seesaw where sometimes

780
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:20,464
we want what we learn to change what we

781
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:24,004
do and other times we want what we do to

782
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:27,412
change what we learn and having that

783
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:31,620
kind of a fulcrum or a pivot and

784
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,392
again to connect it to the vertex

785
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:35,844
popping in and out. The analytical

786
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:38,376
formalisms inscribed on the screen of

787
00:39:38,398 --> 00:39:40,840
the FEP, like the textbooks,

788
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,512
they're ambiguous. Whether we lead with

789
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:47,996
action and have inference follow or

790
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:50,604
whether we lead with inference and have

791
00:39:50,642 --> 00:39:53,836
action follow or lead with action have

792
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,948
inference follow whichever one of the

793
00:39:55,954 --> 00:39:57,950
combinations there are,

794
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,732
and then that trade off

795
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:06,076
or runoff is broken by

796
00:40:06,258 --> 00:40:10,940
specific embodied cognitive agents that

797
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,496
trade off about the procedural primacy

798
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:18,084
of perception or action can't be

799
00:40:18,122 --> 00:40:20,950
broken. Generically, right?

800
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,360
MMM.

801
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,206
It certainly makes for a lot of waste

802
00:40:31,238 --> 00:40:32,650
heat if you're not careful.

803
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,220
It'd be exhausting a lot anyway.

804
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:42,840
Okay.

805
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:51,510
I don't know if we can talk about intent

806
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,794
much with this formalism, but. We can

807
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:58,090
take a very descriptive approach to it

808
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,290
and go down here a little more actually

809
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,498
before I don't want to get ahead of

810
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:12,542
myself. What I mean by that is whether

811
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:13,934
we can put intent or not in this

812
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:17,774
hierarchy, I don't know if it

813
00:41:17,812 --> 00:41:19,658
matters a whole lot, but at least we can

814
00:41:19,684 --> 00:41:21,810
talk about it operationally and

815
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,050
descriptively and say just like when

816
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,730
you have a clock,

817
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,300
the clock is just there, right?

818
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,198
If you don't have the clock, you don't

819
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:38,086
have the memory and that's it, right?

820
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:42,054
And likewise here, if we don't have an

821
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:45,554
attention control compartment, we cannot

822
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:49,446
play with all these QRFs that are non

823
00:41:49,478 --> 00:41:52,540
commutative at the same time.

824
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,754
So if there is no attention control

825
00:41:55,872 --> 00:41:58,794
system to begin with, we cannot talk

826
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:00,854
about a system that has non commutative

827
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:03,354
cure apps. Meaning here, one presumably

828
00:42:03,402 --> 00:42:04,926
goes to memory sectors, the other one

829
00:42:04,948 --> 00:42:07,120
goes to environment sectors and so on.

830
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,126
So this is certainly a necessity of the

831
00:42:15,148 --> 00:42:18,834
fact that we have different sectors

832
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:20,486
of the boundary being allocated to

833
00:42:20,508 --> 00:42:22,630
different purposes, such as

834
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,754
environmental observation and memory and

835
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:28,650
so on, within the environment.

836
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,306
It's worth remarking that here, if you

837
00:42:33,328 --> 00:42:35,900
think deeply about first principles and

838
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:39,630
what it means to observe an entity,

839
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,494
well, you still come down to these

840
00:42:42,532 --> 00:42:44,174
differences that make a difference sort

841
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:47,466
of thing. Right. Which involves whenever

842
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:50,366
you're looking at the environment, if

843
00:42:50,388 --> 00:42:52,066
you're going to identify a system, you

844
00:42:52,088 --> 00:42:54,820
need sort of a background that tells you

845
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,802
that puts the system in context. Right.

846
00:42:58,856 --> 00:43:00,690
So that you can identify the system as

847
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,934
something distinct. I think this,

848
00:43:02,972 --> 00:43:04,326
again, is something that we have talked

849
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:08,146
about in previous discussions

850
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:11,286
where the easiest picture here is

851
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,098
something like the speed gauge in your

852
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:17,738
car, where P

853
00:43:17,824 --> 00:43:20,554
is the gauge itself that tells you the

854
00:43:20,592 --> 00:43:23,690
speed, but it's meaningless

855
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,700
without the reference system right,

856
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:30,266
outside of the thing that stays

857
00:43:30,298 --> 00:43:32,446
invariant, right? The context, the

858
00:43:32,468 --> 00:43:36,094
background that gauge moving means

859
00:43:36,132 --> 00:43:39,662
nothing to you. So we come back to this

860
00:43:39,716 --> 00:43:42,274
idea of if we think of information as

861
00:43:42,312 --> 00:43:44,146
differences that make a difference in

862
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,386
terms of first principles, this

863
00:43:46,488 --> 00:43:48,494
environment sector that we saw earlier

864
00:43:48,622 --> 00:43:51,140
has to be further broken down into

865
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,510
pointer and reference estates.

866
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:58,534
Again, this is covered in depth in

867
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:00,502
Chris's papers. I'm thinking

868
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:03,286
particularly of free energy for

869
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,790
generating quantum systems.

870
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:10,074
And again, just to reiterate this

871
00:44:10,112 --> 00:44:12,730
attention control staff compartment,

872
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,010
which is, by the way, very reminiscent

873
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,006
to the hierarchy that was earlier, with

874
00:44:19,108 --> 00:44:21,758
the clock arising higher up in the

875
00:44:21,764 --> 00:44:25,390
hierarchy, deeper into the layer.

876
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:29,274
Likewise, whenever you're writing

877
00:44:29,322 --> 00:44:31,566
something into MMR, you need to have

878
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:34,106
that clock. Whenever you are deploying

879
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,858
noncommunicated gear apps, you're going

880
00:44:35,864 --> 00:44:39,522
to need an attention control

881
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,742
compartment. And we just described this

882
00:44:41,816 --> 00:44:45,142
operationally. If you didn't have it,

883
00:44:45,196 --> 00:44:47,526
then the agent would not be what it is,

884
00:44:47,628 --> 00:44:49,826
could not deploy those noncommutative

885
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:53,174
QRFs. So,

886
00:44:53,212 --> 00:44:54,200
marching on,

887
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,604
we'll just end here with QRF alignment

888
00:45:00,652 --> 00:45:03,088
and the free energy principle. Just a

889
00:45:03,094 --> 00:45:06,256
few more words. This is possibly the

890
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:09,556
most interesting picture in this

891
00:45:09,658 --> 00:45:13,430
presentation and just we can recall here

892
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,012
the possibilities for KrF alignment and

893
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:21,704
how free energy comes into play in

894
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:27,016
this formalism we

895
00:45:27,038 --> 00:45:28,904
call a the trivial interaction. We call

896
00:45:28,942 --> 00:45:31,240
this a thermal interaction.

897
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,628
And then you have a bunch of

898
00:45:33,634 --> 00:45:35,436
possibilities, right? And depending on

899
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:37,404
each possibility, you're going to see

900
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:40,956
things as noise or

901
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:45,124
as in the paper says, non local hidden

902
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:49,570
variables. The last situation is

903
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,636
what we call alignment when we have QRFs

904
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,040
of the same size, perfectly aligned.

905
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:04,834
Recall, I think this

906
00:46:04,872 --> 00:46:07,220
would be the situation where you have

907
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:12,322
noiseless classical computation,

908
00:46:12,386 --> 00:46:14,294
right? You have A and B just

909
00:46:14,332 --> 00:46:20,278
interacting. And also

910
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:23,878
this is the situation where, correct me

911
00:46:23,884 --> 00:46:25,030
if I'm wrong, Daniel,

912
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,582
this is Entanglements, right?

913
00:46:28,636 --> 00:46:30,986
Asymptotically once all the curves are

914
00:46:31,008 --> 00:46:34,106
aligned, you have entanglement and now

915
00:46:34,128 --> 00:46:38,210
we can tie it back maybe to Dean's

916
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:41,706
earlier. So these two slides conclude

917
00:46:41,738 --> 00:46:43,566
the discussion basically and then we can

918
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:47,322
open it up. So given these possibilities

919
00:46:47,386 --> 00:46:50,698
for how QRFs can be aligned, QRFs

920
00:46:50,714 --> 00:46:54,180
deployed by AMD can be aligned, and how

921
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,546
in each situation you're going to get

922
00:46:56,568 --> 00:46:58,020
noise or whatever,

923
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:03,682
then what does the free energy principle

924
00:47:03,746 --> 00:47:06,230
say in this quantum setting?

925
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:07,960
Well.

926
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,534
Minimizing variational, free energy

927
00:47:12,652 --> 00:47:14,230
leads you to entanglements.

928
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:19,020
So if theorem here,

929
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,938
if you are in the picture of B here

930
00:47:23,104 --> 00:47:26,826
and the QRFs are aligned, a and

931
00:47:26,848 --> 00:47:28,170
B are going to be intact.

932
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,656
Now, there is a tension between this

933
00:47:34,838 --> 00:47:38,384
tendency towards alignment as free

934
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:42,950
energy principle will carry you and

935
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,204
observe reality, which is that we're not

936
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:50,400
just a Blob of Entangled particles.

937
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,612
There is separability and systems

938
00:47:54,756 --> 00:47:56,596
are attention between maintaining

939
00:47:56,628 --> 00:48:00,168
separability and at the

940
00:48:00,174 --> 00:48:02,216
same time being correlated enough to the

941
00:48:02,238 --> 00:48:05,204
environment so as to be able to predict

942
00:48:05,252 --> 00:48:09,164
it. And now we can maybe go into a

943
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:11,356
more philosophical discussion about the

944
00:48:11,378 --> 00:48:14,750
free energy principle. I should also say

945
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,804
in the last month, just like I talked

946
00:48:17,842 --> 00:48:22,060
earlier, TRFs Lenny Suskin,

947
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,892
whose recent paper that talks about TRF

948
00:48:26,056 --> 00:48:27,792
led me into a rabbit hole of looking

949
00:48:27,846 --> 00:48:31,428
into his recent work and he's talked a

950
00:48:31,434 --> 00:48:34,756
lot about complexity. I'm being very

951
00:48:34,858 --> 00:48:38,484
speculative here, so if someone can call

952
00:48:38,522 --> 00:48:41,236
me out, that would be good in the

953
00:48:41,258 --> 00:48:44,536
comments. But just skimming through some

954
00:48:44,558 --> 00:48:48,164
of his papers, I saw a monograph in 2018

955
00:48:48,212 --> 00:48:51,736
where he talks about complexity and he

956
00:48:51,758 --> 00:48:53,224
puts forward this second law for

957
00:48:53,262 --> 00:48:56,228
complexity in quantum systems and

958
00:48:56,254 --> 00:48:59,164
increased complexity. And it is very

959
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,732
reminiscent of what's going on here.

960
00:49:00,786 --> 00:49:04,984
You have a tension between systems

961
00:49:05,032 --> 00:49:08,236
tending to entanglement and the

962
00:49:08,258 --> 00:49:09,472
other side of the free energy

963
00:49:09,526 --> 00:49:12,560
functional, if you wish, where systems

964
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,936
increase in complexity and that

965
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:19,664
necessarily requires that A

966
00:49:19,702 --> 00:49:22,628
and B are separate. So Daniel, do you

967
00:49:22,634 --> 00:49:24,550
have any comments at this point?

968
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,492
Yeah, there's a lot to it. I like that

969
00:49:29,546 --> 00:49:33,300
you showed the four possibilities

970
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,256
in the image above and said it was one

971
00:49:37,278 --> 00:49:40,330
of the most interesting figures. I

972
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:46,404
agree. And how

973
00:49:46,462 --> 00:49:50,460
to connect this to the classical FEP

974
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,112
and also how to see the quantum

975
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:59,296
FEP not as just a

976
00:49:59,318 --> 00:50:01,376
second story built on top of the

977
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:04,256
classical FEP which would be kind of

978
00:50:04,278 --> 00:50:08,220
like a historical chronological

979
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,464
understanding of the theoretical

980
00:50:11,532 --> 00:50:14,036
apparatus. But it's almost like the

981
00:50:14,058 --> 00:50:17,524
quantum FEP was like a basement we

982
00:50:17,562 --> 00:50:22,116
didn't know about because it

983
00:50:22,298 --> 00:50:24,664
gives a broader context. And though it

984
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:28,072
appeared conceptually several years

985
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:32,184
later in the timeline we understand that

986
00:50:32,222 --> 00:50:37,900
doesn't give it a secondary status.

987
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,052
So what it really means for the

988
00:50:41,106 --> 00:50:44,604
classical FEP to be kind

989
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:48,556
of like a

990
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:54,656
special case of this actually

991
00:50:54,758 --> 00:51:00,320
more generic setting

992
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,090
there's just a lot I'm very.

993
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,804
I can wrap it up and then if Dean or you

994
00:51:08,842 --> 00:51:11,412
want to say something, we can continue

995
00:51:11,466 --> 00:51:13,588
with that. But let me conclude and this

996
00:51:13,594 --> 00:51:19,016
is all I have to say for mean,

997
00:51:19,198 --> 00:51:22,120
I'm sure Chris will explain this more in

998
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,936
coming sessions and lectures. But I

999
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:28,428
think the main key differences is in the

1000
00:51:28,514 --> 00:51:31,992
emergence of space. How it might emerge

1001
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:34,316
from something more fundamental, maybe a

1002
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:37,688
tensor network or who knows? But that's

1003
00:51:37,704 --> 00:51:41,196
the big difference, right? And I suppose

1004
00:51:41,228 --> 00:51:43,100
the quantum free energy principle

1005
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,952
generalizes the classical free energy

1006
00:51:46,006 --> 00:51:47,264
principle because it doesn't have this

1007
00:51:47,302 --> 00:51:49,650
spatial embedding. Now,

1008
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,172
this to me personally and also

1009
00:51:55,226 --> 00:51:57,700
to folks in the audience for asking

1010
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:00,180
questions is probably the hardest part

1011
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:04,136
to wrap your head around. And I

1012
00:52:04,158 --> 00:52:07,716
foresee interest in those discussions

1013
00:52:07,748 --> 00:52:10,116
and lectures that deal with the concept

1014
00:52:10,148 --> 00:52:13,224
of emergent space. Because every time

1015
00:52:13,262 --> 00:52:15,944
you try to and I've done this myself

1016
00:52:15,982 --> 00:52:17,304
I've been thinking about how you could

1017
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:20,568
apply this formalism to better known

1018
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:22,264
pictures or compared it, for instance,

1019
00:52:22,312 --> 00:52:24,236
with thermal equilibrium, with

1020
00:52:24,258 --> 00:52:25,656
relaxation, with thermal equilibrium.

1021
00:52:25,688 --> 00:52:26,764
And then you start thinking about,

1022
00:52:26,802 --> 00:52:28,664
okay, what is the boundary and so on.

1023
00:52:28,802 --> 00:52:30,576
It's far from obvious, right? Because,

1024
00:52:30,678 --> 00:52:33,536
again, you have to remind yourself that

1025
00:52:33,558 --> 00:52:36,096
the definition is topological. So in

1026
00:52:36,118 --> 00:52:38,450
that regard, I think it might be worth

1027
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,804
talking about one of the questions that

1028
00:52:42,842 --> 00:52:46,580
came up that I thought was good and then

1029
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:48,790
I can call it a day on this end.

1030
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,108
So this question and I think it was the

1031
00:52:53,114 --> 00:52:55,684
first question asked since the. Last

1032
00:52:55,722 --> 00:52:58,776
lecture can you just read the full

1033
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,664
question and then read the full answer?

1034
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:03,064
Thank you. The answer, it's number 28

1035
00:53:03,102 --> 00:53:04,836
here. Can you guys see it? Should I zoom

1036
00:53:04,868 --> 00:53:07,116
in it a little bit? It's pretty small,

1037
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:10,012
but reading it will be good. Okay. So

1038
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:12,380
this question I think I've asked myself

1039
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:16,924
this question too, maybe in

1040
00:53:16,962 --> 00:53:19,096
a different way. But basically it gets

1041
00:53:19,138 --> 00:53:20,304
to the point of what I was saying

1042
00:53:20,342 --> 00:53:23,696
earlier, right? That it would be

1043
00:53:23,718 --> 00:53:27,216
nice to see how we can use this

1044
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:29,708
quantum free energy principle formalism

1045
00:53:29,884 --> 00:53:32,404
to recover maybe familiar settings such

1046
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:35,232
as relaxation to thermal equilibrium via

1047
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:37,284
the heat equation. But that's far from

1048
00:53:37,322 --> 00:53:38,976
obvious how you do it if your definition

1049
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:40,550
is topological, right?

1050
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,436
So the question says, what happens when

1051
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:46,048
the agent becomes identical to the

1052
00:53:46,074 --> 00:53:48,616
environment? When the model has been

1053
00:53:48,638 --> 00:53:50,440
improved so much that it does not differ

1054
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:52,024
from the environment. Is this a state

1055
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,224
even possible? Would it be

1056
00:53:53,262 --> 00:53:56,052
thermodynamical equilibrium maximum

1057
00:53:56,116 --> 00:53:58,588
entanglement? Okay, so clearly it's not

1058
00:53:58,674 --> 00:54:00,524
thermodynamical equilibrium, but I think

1059
00:54:00,562 --> 00:54:03,468
what the person is asking if maybe if

1060
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:04,696
I'm understanding this correctly,

1061
00:54:04,728 --> 00:54:06,764
they're wondering, okay, so if the free

1062
00:54:06,802 --> 00:54:10,192
energy principle drives A and B towards

1063
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:14,210
entanglement, then it's fair to say that

1064
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,224
any distinction between them has

1065
00:54:16,262 --> 00:54:18,684
dissolved, right? That they have merged

1066
00:54:18,732 --> 00:54:19,890
into the same thing.

1067
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,660
That has to do with this whole

1068
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:27,044
definition of philosophical debate of

1069
00:54:27,082 --> 00:54:30,068
thingness that Karl Prieston is a

1070
00:54:30,074 --> 00:54:32,836
proponent of, right? What it means for

1071
00:54:32,858 --> 00:54:35,290
two things to be separate. Okay,

1072
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,770
so let's see what Chris said.

1073
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,044
Kristen has pointed out that the limit

1074
00:54:43,092 --> 00:54:44,776
of the classical FEP, the limit of

1075
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:46,616
perfect prediction, corresponds to

1076
00:54:46,638 --> 00:54:48,076
generalized synchrony between system and

1077
00:54:48,098 --> 00:54:50,316
environment. Each sends messages that

1078
00:54:50,338 --> 00:54:52,380
the other can perfectly predict.

1079
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,848
Now, however, it's clear I'm

1080
00:54:57,864 --> 00:55:00,304
not reading anymore. I'm making a quick

1081
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:02,544
remark here. I'll continue in a second.

1082
00:55:02,742 --> 00:55:07,680
In the classical FEP, it's clear that

1083
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,944
A and B, even if they are in the perfect

1084
00:55:10,982 --> 00:55:15,430
limit of the FEP, they remain different

1085
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,412
entities. Right? Because you have that,

1086
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:23,612
if you wish, that extra layers

1087
00:55:23,776 --> 00:55:26,616
of differentiation coming from their

1088
00:55:26,718 --> 00:55:29,096
spatial embedding. Right? In the

1089
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,624
classical FEP that is clear that they

1090
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,464
haven't even if they are getting

1091
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:36,936
synchronized, they have not lost their

1092
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,596
separate identities. You can always say,

1093
00:55:38,638 --> 00:55:40,636
well, this is the one that was to the

1094
00:55:40,658 --> 00:55:42,188
left and this is the one that was to the

1095
00:55:42,194 --> 00:55:43,912
right. Pun intended with earlier

1096
00:55:43,976 --> 00:55:47,630
discussion, right? You have that extra

1097
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:53,216
resource for separating them, if you

1098
00:55:53,238 --> 00:55:54,832
wish, by virtue of the special

1099
00:55:54,886 --> 00:55:56,396
embedding, right? The special embedding

1100
00:55:56,428 --> 00:55:57,984
is giving you this extra information

1101
00:55:58,102 --> 00:56:02,124
that allows you to keep track of amb

1102
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:04,436
separately. So I'll continue. This

1103
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:05,716
notion depends on the system and its

1104
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:07,136
environment being separated and hence

1105
00:56:07,168 --> 00:56:09,792
distinguished somehow. In classical

1106
00:56:09,856 --> 00:56:11,476
formulations, they are separated in

1107
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:14,272
ordinary 3D space, I e. They occupy

1108
00:56:14,336 --> 00:56:16,136
different locations. So they are

1109
00:56:16,158 --> 00:56:17,432
different because they occupy different

1110
00:56:17,486 --> 00:56:19,176
locations. Right. But if you don't have

1111
00:56:19,198 --> 00:56:22,344
that geometrical background, then how

1112
00:56:22,382 --> 00:56:23,832
you know that they're different, right?

1113
00:56:23,966 --> 00:56:26,724
Okay, so I continue. The quantum

1114
00:56:26,772 --> 00:56:28,564
formulation is background free, meaning

1115
00:56:28,612 --> 00:56:30,232
it assumes no spacetime embedding.

1116
00:56:30,296 --> 00:56:31,596
System and environment do not have

1117
00:56:31,618 --> 00:56:32,796
different locations, even though they

1118
00:56:32,818 --> 00:56:34,556
have different sets of degrees of

1119
00:56:34,578 --> 00:56:36,830
freedom in the overall Hilbert space.

1120
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,380
Here the FPP. The limit of the FEP

1121
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,256
is maximum entanglement. This does not

1122
00:56:44,278 --> 00:56:45,532
mean that the system and its environment

1123
00:56:45,596 --> 00:56:47,264
are identical. They are. And they have

1124
00:56:47,302 --> 00:56:49,344
different degrees of freedom. Okay, so

1125
00:56:49,382 --> 00:56:52,576
this is just addresses the question I

1126
00:56:52,598 --> 00:56:54,784
just posed. It means that the joint

1127
00:56:54,832 --> 00:56:59,684
state is not separable into

1128
00:56:59,722 --> 00:57:02,324
a system S and environment e. Their

1129
00:57:02,362 --> 00:57:03,776
states are no longer conditionally

1130
00:57:03,808 --> 00:57:05,976
independent. This is distinct from

1131
00:57:05,998 --> 00:57:07,768
thermal equilibrium, which means that

1132
00:57:07,774 --> 00:57:09,544
they have the same temperature while

1133
00:57:09,582 --> 00:57:12,472
remaining separable and that their

1134
00:57:12,526 --> 00:57:14,376
interaction can be characterized as the

1135
00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:16,456
change of thermal fluctuations I E

1136
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:20,508
noise. So I

1137
00:57:20,514 --> 00:57:22,044
guess this is a nice warm up for things

1138
00:57:22,082 --> 00:57:24,572
that are to come. But I do think that

1139
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:28,296
this whole idea of emergent

1140
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:32,640
space is going to be possibly

1141
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,090
one of the most important in the course,

1142
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,824
and it's going to help the gap between

1143
00:57:39,862 --> 00:57:42,196
the class and quantum formulations, for

1144
00:57:42,218 --> 00:57:45,604
sure. Dean, what's your take

1145
00:57:45,642 --> 00:57:49,236
on this? What I saw was that when you

1146
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:50,836
have that kind of alignment, that

1147
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:54,232
perfect alignment, that was one that was

1148
00:57:54,286 --> 00:57:58,212
D in that diagram,

1149
00:57:58,276 --> 00:58:02,004
right? That was one state of a complex

1150
00:58:02,132 --> 00:58:04,632
state that included an A and a B and a C

1151
00:58:04,686 --> 00:58:07,228
and probably a whole bunch of other ways

1152
00:58:07,314 --> 00:58:10,588
that yeah, right.

1153
00:58:10,674 --> 00:58:14,056
So that one state where you've

1154
00:58:14,088 --> 00:58:18,252
got this kind of entanglement isn't into

1155
00:58:18,306 --> 00:58:20,096
perpetuity. Like you don't get there and

1156
00:58:20,118 --> 00:58:22,016
then stay there. And that's where, I

1157
00:58:22,038 --> 00:58:25,792
think, the question of separability and

1158
00:58:25,846 --> 00:58:29,200
complexity, it still works

1159
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:31,404
because just because you've momentarily

1160
00:58:31,452 --> 00:58:34,724
gotten to a place that we define here as

1161
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:36,564
D doesn't mean you stay there

1162
00:58:36,602 --> 00:58:38,896
indefinitely. You could be swapping

1163
00:58:38,928 --> 00:58:42,164
around to B and C and A in the next

1164
00:58:42,282 --> 00:58:46,056
instant. So at

1165
00:58:46,078 --> 00:58:48,040
least that holds the complexity piece

1166
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:51,784
up. That moment for

1167
00:58:51,822 --> 00:58:54,376
however long that moment is. Where X A

1168
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:57,420
and X B are aligned isn't permanent.

1169
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,316
So it's not predictable in that sense.

1170
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:03,884
Therefore it is complex. I still

1171
00:59:03,922 --> 00:59:06,876
don't know how we get, though, that the

1172
00:59:06,898 --> 00:59:08,936
closer we get to agreement, the more

1173
00:59:09,058 --> 00:59:12,428
complex things are. Unless we're

1174
00:59:12,444 --> 00:59:15,264
just talking about D in this array of

1175
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:19,024
ABC and D that

1176
00:59:19,062 --> 00:59:20,524
goes back to that quantum reference

1177
00:59:20,572 --> 00:59:22,980
frame. I think, like I said, again,

1178
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,684
maybe I'm interpreting this wrong, but

1179
00:59:25,802 --> 00:59:29,204
when I message pass the reason why,

1180
00:59:29,242 --> 00:59:31,268
I have to literally give it over to the

1181
00:59:31,274 --> 00:59:34,116
other person and let them have it. I

1182
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:37,864
can't have them copy. What I'm doing is

1183
00:59:37,902 --> 00:59:41,304
because there has to be, I guess that

1184
00:59:41,342 --> 00:59:43,496
reinforces the separability piece of

1185
00:59:43,518 --> 00:59:45,896
this as well, the fact that I can't give

1186
00:59:45,918 --> 00:59:48,124
them a copy, that I can only give them

1187
00:59:48,162 --> 00:59:50,076
the information, and then they've got to

1188
00:59:50,178 --> 00:59:53,996
sort of unpack it in

1189
00:59:54,018 --> 00:59:56,844
their own way of taking it off the

1190
00:59:56,882 --> 00:59:58,830
boundary. But again,

1191
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:04,156
I struggle with this. I'm guilty

1192
01:00:04,188 --> 01:00:07,344
as charged, but what I'm trying to do is

1193
01:00:07,382 --> 01:00:09,212
trying to come up with my own narrative,

1194
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:13,116
so that what Chris is saying makes

1195
01:00:13,158 --> 01:00:16,324
sense to me, as opposed to make sense to

1196
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:17,844
the world, which is what Chris is trying

1197
01:00:17,882 --> 01:00:21,044
to do. I'll try

1198
01:00:21,082 --> 01:00:24,650
with another speculative fiction. So

1199
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,376
there's a screen between, let's just

1200
01:00:28,398 --> 01:00:30,456
say, the stage and the audience or

1201
01:00:30,478 --> 01:00:32,392
whatever. It's a holographic screen.

1202
01:00:32,526 --> 01:00:34,692
And on each side of the screen, there's

1203
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,790
some embodied object.

1204
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,348
So that means that it's a

1205
01:00:42,354 --> 01:00:44,988
volume enclosing object because points

1206
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:47,292
and lines and planes are only

1207
01:00:47,346 --> 01:00:49,600
abstractions. Every real physical object

1208
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:53,264
encloses volume. And now a light is

1209
01:00:53,302 --> 01:00:55,360
going to be coming from behind each

1210
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:58,636
object facing the screen. And that's

1211
01:00:58,668 --> 01:01:02,188
this kind of cone that we're seeing from

1212
01:01:02,214 --> 01:01:04,500
each side. It's like the shadow cast by

1213
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:06,788
the object. So if the object was a

1214
01:01:06,794 --> 01:01:09,364
sphere, then it would be projecting down

1215
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:13,076
to a circle onto the screen.

1216
01:01:13,258 --> 01:01:16,648
If the shape were a cube, it could be

1217
01:01:16,814 --> 01:01:19,112
projecting down. And so where the light

1218
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:23,300
is positioned is the perspective

1219
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,984
that that cognitive entity is taking on

1220
01:01:27,022 --> 01:01:30,604
its QRF. Those lights could move.

1221
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:31,996
So now we have the situation where the

1222
01:01:32,018 --> 01:01:34,028
two spotlights are moving. Maybe the

1223
01:01:34,034 --> 01:01:35,484
shapes are staying the same, maybe

1224
01:01:35,522 --> 01:01:38,252
they're changing too. And it's like two

1225
01:01:38,306 --> 01:01:42,912
search lights scanning across this B

1226
01:01:43,046 --> 01:01:46,704
oval and sometimes

1227
01:01:46,822 --> 01:01:49,936
they are perfectly locked or there could

1228
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:51,888
be a situation where they're perfectly

1229
01:01:51,984 --> 01:01:54,976
aligned or there could be situations

1230
01:01:55,008 --> 01:01:57,620
where they're totally disjoint.

1231
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,812
And each of those situations have

1232
01:02:01,866 --> 01:02:06,410
different implications for what

1233
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:11,272
one entity sees when

1234
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:14,744
it looks at the screen. Maybe like the

1235
01:02:14,782 --> 01:02:16,604
shadow is the only part where you can

1236
01:02:16,642 --> 01:02:19,372
see because the rest of it is too

1237
01:02:19,426 --> 01:02:22,124
blinding or something like that. And so

1238
01:02:22,162 --> 01:02:26,350
then if we're in case A here where

1239
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,276
maybe B doesn't have a projection or

1240
01:02:29,298 --> 01:02:31,196
maybe B's projection is totally

1241
01:02:31,308 --> 01:02:34,272
somewhere else, then A is in this

1242
01:02:34,406 --> 01:02:36,656
solipsistic I'm the active agent

1243
01:02:36,758 --> 01:02:38,272
interacting within an inert world

1244
01:02:38,326 --> 01:02:41,972
setting. And D is

1245
01:02:42,026 --> 01:02:47,124
like potentially the

1246
01:02:47,162 --> 01:02:51,024
computer engineer's classical dream

1247
01:02:51,072 --> 01:02:54,040
or Asymptote, which is like all the data

1248
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,730
going through the USB cable is just

1249
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:00,520
being perfectly noiselessly received.

1250
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:05,080
And then we also get these B and C

1251
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:08,568
cases. But A is kind

1252
01:03:08,574 --> 01:03:12,444
of like the inert world. D is

1253
01:03:12,482 --> 01:03:15,500
like the perfect communication channel

1254
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:17,336
and then to connect it just to Friston's

1255
01:03:17,368 --> 01:03:19,436
concept of generalized synchrony. As

1256
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:20,608
we've talked about many times,

1257
01:03:20,694 --> 01:03:23,040
generalized synchrony doesn't mean

1258
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,904
lockstep. Two agents could reduce their

1259
01:03:25,942 --> 01:03:28,176
uncertainty about each other, not by

1260
01:03:28,198 --> 01:03:30,176
doing the same thing at every time step,

1261
01:03:30,278 --> 01:03:32,948
but for example by turn taking. And I

1262
01:03:32,954 --> 01:03:35,908
think that points the way to how we get

1263
01:03:35,994 --> 01:03:38,276
reduction of variational free energy,

1264
01:03:38,378 --> 01:03:40,224
reduction of prediction error, surprise

1265
01:03:40,272 --> 01:03:44,376
and so on without especially

1266
01:03:44,478 --> 01:03:46,536
spatial temporal enmeshment, but not

1267
01:03:46,558 --> 01:03:49,780
necessarily even informational identity

1268
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:52,136
enmeshment. Because you could have two

1269
01:03:52,158 --> 01:03:54,040
things that through their alignment

1270
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:58,156
become actually differentiated and

1271
01:03:58,178 --> 01:03:59,912
that could increase the mutual

1272
01:03:59,976 --> 01:04:02,476
information between two metronomes. Not

1273
01:04:02,498 --> 01:04:03,852
just to have them going in the same

1274
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:06,684
direction, but to have them going in

1275
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:08,788
opposite directions. The mutual

1276
01:04:08,824 --> 01:04:10,624
information in those two settings is

1277
01:04:10,662 --> 01:04:13,136
going to be high. So it's not the case

1278
01:04:13,158 --> 01:04:15,730
that generalized synchrony means that

1279
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:23,700
things are becoming blurred.

1280
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,616
We could actually also have integrated

1281
01:04:27,728 --> 01:04:31,380
information through increased

1282
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:36,040
articulation, not just decreased.

1283
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:40,260
And then life finds a way or cognition

1284
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:43,876
finds a way. On this trade off frontier

1285
01:04:43,988 --> 01:04:47,400
of in our pursuit of unitarity,

1286
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:52,100
will we blur to unify

1287
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:55,396
or will we differentiate to unify?

1288
01:04:55,588 --> 01:04:58,376
But those are the paths we have. We

1289
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:00,960
don't have the backwards.

1290
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,290
Yeah, yeah, makes sense.

1291
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,220
Any other latter slides ender?

1292
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,220
No, that's it. So Chris made a few more

1293
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:24,520
remarks at the end about language

1294
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,680
here, but he mentioned

1295
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,904
that he's going to talk more about this

1296
01:05:30,942 --> 01:05:33,304
in the coming lecture. So we'll just

1297
01:05:33,342 --> 01:05:34,410
leave it up to him.

1298
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:43,170
Yeah. There could be some very powerful

1299
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:48,550
and interesting linguistic opportunities

1300
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:54,170
for updating our

1301
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:57,962
speaking to reflect what

1302
01:05:58,016 --> 01:06:01,180
we are learning here.

1303
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:05,280
I don't know what those necessarily are,

1304
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:10,746
whether it's a syntactic or a semantic

1305
01:06:10,778 --> 01:06:13,760
thing or whether it's a narrative thing,

1306
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:19,186
but how to actually reenter some

1307
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:23,618
of these formalisms into our focus

1308
01:06:23,784 --> 01:06:27,106
understanding could just be

1309
01:06:27,128 --> 01:06:31,286
immensely powerful and we

1310
01:06:31,308 --> 01:06:34,902
could have a lot of integrity between

1311
01:06:34,956 --> 01:06:37,862
the natural language way that

1312
01:06:37,916 --> 01:06:40,742
potentially were already showing up for

1313
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:44,154
engagement and some of these

1314
01:06:44,272 --> 01:06:48,106
formalisms that get to

1315
01:06:48,128 --> 01:06:50,262
first principles about interacting

1316
01:06:50,326 --> 01:06:52,858
entities and boundary conditions and all

1317
01:06:52,864 --> 01:06:57,018
of that. Dean, any penultimate

1318
01:06:57,114 --> 01:07:00,286
thoughts? Not really. I'm going to go

1319
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:03,326
back and listen to the I'm going to

1320
01:07:03,348 --> 01:07:04,974
listen to Chris's comments again about

1321
01:07:05,012 --> 01:07:07,566
this common cause and the fine tuning

1322
01:07:07,598 --> 01:07:09,780
assumption and whether that's sort of

1323
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:13,346
metaphorically, a dialing in or what

1324
01:07:13,368 --> 01:07:16,146
he means exactly by the fine tuning. In

1325
01:07:16,168 --> 01:07:18,994
the context of this conversation today,

1326
01:07:19,192 --> 01:07:21,046
what you just kind of said about are we

1327
01:07:21,068 --> 01:07:23,334
dulling something here or are we

1328
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,526
sculpting something to make it more

1329
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,918
fittable? I'm going to go

1330
01:07:29,004 --> 01:07:32,298
now and go back and listen to what he

1331
01:07:32,384 --> 01:07:33,978
talks about in terms of fine tuning and

1332
01:07:33,984 --> 01:07:36,860
maybe update my priors around that.

1333
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,874
And are there any last thoughts or maybe

1334
01:07:42,912 --> 01:07:45,598
scroll over to the schedule of the

1335
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:47,566
course again just so we can close on

1336
01:07:47,588 --> 01:07:50,878
that? Yeah,

1337
01:07:50,964 --> 01:07:53,626
we're halfway through. We just completed

1338
01:07:53,658 --> 01:07:56,866
the third discussion section now, so

1339
01:07:56,888 --> 01:07:59,490
we've had three lectures and three

1340
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,242
discussions. It's all downhill from

1341
01:08:02,296 --> 01:08:04,834
here. By the way, this was the first

1342
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:08,180
midterm. You guys both did well.

1343
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:13,682
We're going to head into session

1344
01:08:13,746 --> 01:08:16,038
four with these last three, how agents

1345
01:08:16,124 --> 01:08:18,038
use multiple communication channels and

1346
01:08:18,044 --> 01:08:19,158
that's going to get connected to the

1347
01:08:19,164 --> 01:08:22,534
quantum FEP, how spacetime emerges from

1348
01:08:22,572 --> 01:08:24,426
communication, which is something that

1349
01:08:24,448 --> 01:08:26,986
we've brought up a bunch. It's been in

1350
01:08:27,008 --> 01:08:29,286
the background, but making that explicit

1351
01:08:29,318 --> 01:08:30,522
is going to be exciting. And then

1352
01:08:30,576 --> 01:08:33,366
section six, I think, is just going to

1353
01:08:33,408 --> 01:08:37,870
be such a jumping off point because

1354
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:42,190
the scope and the intensity of what

1355
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:44,750
is transpiring is extreme.

1356
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:48,914
So connecting it to biology, which is

1357
01:08:48,952 --> 01:08:52,114
to say life more fully, and where

1358
01:08:52,152 --> 01:08:55,330
we go in 23 and beyond,

1359
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:58,414
that's going to be awesome. So, any last

1360
01:08:58,472 --> 01:09:01,494
words, Andrew? No,

1361
01:09:01,532 --> 01:09:03,160
I just echo what you said.

1362
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:07,366
I would say it's going to be uphill in

1363
01:09:07,388 --> 01:09:09,366
terms of how interesting it's going to

1364
01:09:09,388 --> 01:09:12,698
get uphill in a good sense,

1365
01:09:12,784 --> 01:09:15,690
meaning that we're planning cool.

1366
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,994
Well, I encourage people to check out

1367
01:09:18,032 --> 01:09:21,802
the course website and submit questions

1368
01:09:21,856 --> 01:09:23,306
that they'd like to see addressed by

1369
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:26,154
Chris. Also to register and join these

1370
01:09:26,192 --> 01:09:27,946
participatory discussions. There'll be

1371
01:09:27,968 --> 01:09:30,826
three more of them, so if you want to

1372
01:09:30,928 --> 01:09:33,610
join, share your QRF,

1373
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,834
be part of the public of all of these

1374
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:39,090
works that we'll compile at the end and

1375
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,946
just get your exoskeleton in the

1376
01:09:42,968 --> 01:09:45,966
game with what is happening here. It'd

1377
01:09:45,998 --> 01:09:48,654
be really awesome to hear more voices

1378
01:09:48,782 --> 01:09:51,460
and to have more on board.

1379
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:55,118
Okay, thank you, Dean, and Ander till

1380
01:09:55,214 --> 01:09:56,180
next time.
