4280	36340	00:04	It's July 1, 2023. We're in Physics as Information processing in the second discussion. Feel free to write questions in the Live chat and I'll relay them onwards.	Welcome to the second Physics as Information processing Live chat	Quantum physics talk
37000	349864	00:37	 quantum theory in terms of reformulation of opposed to dynamical theory. Chris last lecture started with these three basic ingredients. This is the qubit, the physical degrees of freedom that we need to perturb in some way to ask a question. And then finally, a semantics, a language that makes sense.	Andrei: So now we're getting to reformulation of quantum theory	Quantum mechanics, the ontology of measurement
349982	534710	05:49	Dean Obeidallah: Measurement and preparation are completely dual pictures. In generating that cycle, obviously there has to be some notion of time. This is going to be intimately related to notions of thermal time. We're going to have an internal time QRF that is the true local time, as the observer perceives.	Measurement and preparation are completely dual pictures, right?	Quantum mechanics 6, Time cycles
535800	905376	08:55	Alexey: Can something be both gripper in the conceptual meaning sense ontologically and gripped a physical object? Chris: Being able to have both can be true. Alexey: We have to have that sense that there is a transfer and there is the mechanics. We must keep both juggling all the time.	Alex: Chris described information transfer in a quantum theoretic way	Quantum mechanics and the information transfer
905398	1190656	15:05	In Shannon common language, there's a receiver and receiver and the alphabet that they share. But a reference frame has to have physical embodiment and that's a piece of hardware. So your semantics are affected ultimately by a physical piece of Hardware.	So when Chris talked about the reference frame and said common language, I got lost	Reference Frames and the Physical
1190688	1852686	19:50	Daniel: I get lost with a saying that preparation and measurement are they have to happen both. When you prepare or when you read, you modify. Is that painting at the same the picture of or am I preparing? Are just completely dual.	Daniel: I get lost with a saying that preparation and measurement are both	Quantum Science: Preparation and Measurement
1852788	2083986	30:52	Asking a question implies your correspondent can tell you anything. We're dealing with something that's orders of composition above the kind of binary ask. We don't get to ask free floating questions where the question and or agentic responder are not involved already in a semantics.	Dean: Let go of the metaphor of asking a question	A Question or a Question?
2084098	2355054	34:44	Dean: Let's talk a little bit about Holographic screens. All the information exchange is mediated by bits here at the qubits, at this holographic screen. This in turn enforces a finiteness in the information transfer. Chris will deal with this at greater detail in perhaps lecture five.	All these thermodynamic constraints on information processing necessitate breakdown of holographic boundary	Holographic screens and the physics of science
2355252	2689910	39:15	Dean Ornstein: What is this whole thing about unitary evolution or preparation? He says quantum mechanics is about measurement, not mechanical motion. Space and time arise from communicating agents, Ornstein says.	So what is this whole thing about unitary evolution or preparation	Quantum Mechanics and the Unitary Evolution
2690070	3037640	44:50	There were some nice questions relating mark of blankets to the scattering picture. What is meant by local free choice? Isolated systems are idealized by definition. There's always going to be an observer interacting with an environment. Andre, do you want to go to the questions?	Andrei: There were some interesting questions raised in the Q and A	Quantum entanglement and the law of measurement
3038410	3116350	50:38	In a graph, there is no symmetry imposed. The only natural sense of symmetry would be energy conservation. If you are to talk about any sort of symmetry, the natural language would not be in terms of incoming versus outcome in arrows.	The only natural sense of symmetry would be energy conservation, right	Energy conservation of a symmetrical input output bandwidth
3117650	3230890	51:57	The last question is about the Holographic principle. Does it make it easier to compute any physics problems? These ideas of holography are used all over physics nowadays. People can see all the questions on the website and submit their own.	The last question that I would like to bring your attention to is this one	Questions for the Holographic Principle
3231980	3355382	53:51	Even if you're using an external clock, everything that you perceive outside at the end of the day has to be in terms of an internal clock. Your own subjective perception of information will depend on internal clocks. So we can open up things.	Everything that you perceive outside depends on your internal clock, Chris says	Internal Clock and Synchrony
3355436	3780030	55:55	Session two focused on the Measurability question, which is answered with a question. Session three will introduce the idea of quantum reference frames and the representation using Hierarchies of binary classifiers. Maybe he's still watching and he'll answer the questions better than I could.	Andre: Where are we heading into session three on quantum measurement	Quantum measurement: time and the causal chain
3781890	4271850	1:03:01	Making an observation in quantum theory is taking an action on the world. The act of observation itself requires banging something into an object. Preparation is just measurement run backwards and vice versa. What's the reference frame that Alice is using when she's measuring up or down?	Making an observation in quantum theory is taking an action on the world	Quantum Science: Preparation and Measurement, Duality
4272830	4350820	1:11:12	Awesome. What tells you that there's a difference there? It's what you're able to detect and represent internally. And then three, you need the semantic frame that makes A and B different differences all the way down. Well, we will transcribe this and fix the few patchy moments ender. We'll work together on updating the transcript.	Differences that make a difference would tell you that you require action	Measurement of Difference in the Third Lect
4353910	4362790	1:12:33	Thank you, Chris, for joining. That's a fun cap to this discussion. See you next time.	Chris: That's a fun cap to this discussion	Democracy and the Future
