00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,230
Hello.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,524
It's July 1, 2023.

3
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:14,840
We're in “Physics as Information Processing” in the second discussion.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,732
So thanks all for joining, and we'll see who else comes in.

5
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:25,288
If you're watching Live, feel free to write questions in the Live chat and I'll relay them onwards.

6
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:26,584
So Ander,

7
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:27,244
thanks,

8
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:33,750
nd it would be awesome to begin with a little bit of some overview and some points that you wanted to get to.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,204
Yeah.

10
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:36,340
Thank you, Daniel.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,420
So, good morning, everyone.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:47,290
So if you would start what Chris spoke about last time.

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,610
I have a few slides that I singled out.

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:06,620
So now we're getting to reformulation of quantum theory in terms of reformulation of opposed to dynamical theory.

15
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:16,720
And as we've talked in previous sessions, we need to think a little bit philosophically about what the ontology of measurement entails.

16
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,580
So Chris last lecture started with these three basic ingredients.

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,524
So an action that's, number one, a thing to ask about.

18
00:01:31,722 --> 00:01:38,410
This is the qubit, the physical degrees of freedom that we need to perturb in some way to ask a question.

19
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:46,380
And then finally, a semantics, a language that makes sense, a context that makes sense of that information that we gather.

20
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:58,928
So I should say, number one, I came up in the first question when I can't exactly remember.

21
00:01:59,014 --> 00:02:02,210
But at some point, we talked about what is information?

22
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,956
And we came up with or we brought up a definition that goes something like this.

23
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:10,784
It's a nice adage.

24
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:13,828
It's “a differences that make a difference.”

25
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:24,136
This is… Chris told me… I can't remember who first coined this adage, but I think it's quite old, at least early 70s.

26
00:02:24,238 --> 00:02:28,616
Anyway, so number one, basically perturb that part, right?

27
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:32,596
If I want to gather some information, I need to perturb a system somehow.

28
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:33,844
So I need to act.

29
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:37,580
And this is literally in units of actions, right?

30
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,916
So units of energy times time.

31
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:49,260
And he provided the example of rhodopsin, which is apparently near optimal from a quantum perspective.

32
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,936
This is mechanically what goes on in your eyes as light comes in.

33
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:57,920
And this is clearly the difference that makes a difference in your brain.

34
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,992
The second part were the physical degrees of freedom.

35
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:08,836
So recall that we had a boundary, okay?

36
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:39,310
So this theory of quantum mechanics as measurement necessarily breaks down the system into a bipartite system with a boundary, which […] are a lot smaller than the degrees of freedom of A and B, at least in terms of the dimension of the Hilbert space and media change.

37
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,560
Sorry, can you repeat, Ander?

38
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,304
Repeat what?

39
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:46,400
Sorry, just last 30 seconds.

40
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,456
Yeah.

41
00:03:47,558 --> 00:04:08,010
So the second ingredient is the physical medium in which this information exchange occurs, where the physical degrees of freedom, the qubits, are arranged, and these are physically perturbed in order to mediate that difference that makes a difference.

42
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,880
So we can think of this dually as either preparing those qubits or decoding those qubits.

43
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,820
And then finally, there was the notion of the reference frame.

44
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:30,524
Okay, so the theory necessitates a free choice of the agent of a reference frame.

45
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:40,096
And physically what this amounts to is a free choice of a measurement axis for those qubits.

46
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:45,408
So we can think of measuring Z spin in those qubits on the boundary.

47
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:50,500
So that requires a free choice of that axis.

48
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:58,228
And this amounts to your reference frame, the context in which those measurements are performed.

49
00:04:58,404 --> 00:05:08,140
On one extreme case, we have that if those references are perfectly aligned, then the exchange of information is noiseless.

50
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:08,956
There.

51
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:10,524
Was it somewhere over here?

52
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:13,240
I think I can't quite recall.

53
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,344
But generically, these two reference frames of Alice and Bob, A and B are not exactly the same.

54
00:05:19,462 --> 00:05:21,772
They get to choose the reference frames.

55
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:24,848
I think it's all the way on the bottom, actually.

56
00:05:25,014 --> 00:05:26,988
Right, so they can be aligned.

57
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:30,164
If they're aligned, they are exchanging noiseless information.

58
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:30,708
Right.

59
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:38,900
There is no randomness if they are not superposition onto.

60
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,684
And that's when you're going to get probabilities in the outcomes.

61
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:45,240
Trivial probabilities.

62
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,450
So far, so good.

63
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:49,864
Yes.

64
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:56,108
Okay, so I have a few more comments of the main things.

65
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:57,084
Okay.

66
00:05:57,282 --> 00:06:00,780
It'll take me a few minutes and then we can chat back and forth.

67
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,768
Perhaps this slide is interesting, important.

68
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:17,584
I remember this is where I asked the question myself, because it's not easy to wrap your head around what's going on here.

69
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:22,020
So we said that measurement and preparation are completely dual pictures.

70
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,056
So this is going to be expanded on in the next lecture.

71
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:42,920
But a jerk corollary of that is that if you prepare Chris said it in similar terms, if you prepare something in a certain state and then you measure it right away, you should expect that it's still in that state, right?

72
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:53,310
So, intuitively speaking, this induces a cycle, right, where you have preparation and measurement and you're back to square one, so to speak.

73
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:04,990
And in generating that cycle, obviously there has to be some notion of time, right?

74
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:15,156
So that's where we're going to have to make sense of the distinction between internal and external time.

75
00:07:15,258 --> 00:07:24,936
If we take this measurement operator and here perform some operations, we can write it as a unitary propagator from quantum mechanics, which again preserves information.

76
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:26,970
It just leaves the state as it is.

77
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:36,392
But with this little trick of the weak rotation, you can write it as e [raised] to the measurement, up to a constant.

78
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:49,490
And that precisely encodes, at least, more or less speaking, what we just said, right, that this preparation measurement thing is a cycle, and more importantly, it gets rid of this t external time.

79
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:58,572
And presumably in here it's going to be replaced by some notion of internal time.

80
00:07:58,726 --> 00:08:07,380
We're going to have an internal time QRF, that is the true local time, as the observer perceives.

81
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:21,770
I'm not entirely certain of the details, but now, looking at it, here the beta, which presumably there's beta and inverse temperature here.

82
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,364
I think this is going to be intimately related to notions of thermal time.

83
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:39,710
This has been explored in papers by [Carlo] Rovelli called Internal Time QRFs [Rovelli (1993) Statistical mechanics of gravity and the thermodynamical origin of time]. And thermal time is the way in which the observer observes the passage of time.

84
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,432
Those papers of Rovelli are linked in the Q and A by the way.

85
00:08:44,486 --> 00:08:47,010
So I can also provide links later.

86
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,696
I think there might have been a question.

87
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:52,796
Should I stop?

88
00:08:52,838 --> 00:08:53,664
Yeah, Dean.

89
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:54,710
Go for it.

90
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:12,200
I was curious about this because what I heard Chris start this session with was that he was going to try to help us understand when we are looking at something through a mechanical lens.

91
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:36,524
So quantum mechanics and to me this slide was the way of addressing, as he said his words were characterized information transfer in a quantum theoretic way that the translation from H to M took the mechanics aspect out of the change or timepiece.

92
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:49,860
It was the purification, the most theoretical form of transfer of information as opposed to holding up just the one ordered or sequenced or mechanical lens.

93
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:59,704
I heard you ask the question and I kind of smiled because I thought to myself no, I understand why Anders is asking this question.

94
00:09:59,902 --> 00:10:11,196
It's can something be both gripper in the conceptual meaning sense ontologically and gripped a physical object.

95
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:14,712
And I think what I thought maybe I was misinterpreting.

96
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:18,128
I'd like what your perspective on this is.

97
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:26,940
That ability to go from H to M is what allows us to have both the mechanical and the theoretical.

98
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:34,532
The transference in its purest sense is that being able to have both can be true.

99
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,300
Is that what it is?

100
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,710
Yes, for sure.

101
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,650
Yeah.

102
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,950
Much else to say here.

103
00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:01,068
It is true that you can think of the information transfer picture as an enlargement or an addition to the mechanical picture.

104
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:06,770
And that I don't think that the mechanical picture has to be just thrown out completely.

105
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:15,232
I think it's interesting to keep it to see how it can be recovered from the information processing picture.

106
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:21,904
This reminds me actually there is an Italian physicist, I think his name is Chiribella [2017, GM D'Ariano, G. Chiribella, P. Perinotti "Quantum theory from first principles: an informational approach"].

107
00:11:21,952 --> 00:11:32,512
And Dean, if you want, I can link you the papers later who is very fond of the information theoretical approach to quantum mechanics and deducing quantum mechanics from first principles.

108
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:58,500
And he [actually, D'Ariano, not Chiribella] has a paper, I think the title is Physics without Physics [2016, Physics Without Physics-The Power of Information-theoretical Principles, GM D'Ariano] or something like that, where he treats this whole thing as a big seller automaton and by taking appropriate scaling limits he derives QFT, non-interacting QFT.

109
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:07,700
So he says, okay, let me start with some axioms how information should be information processing.

110
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,928
I mean, I'm very loose here.

111
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:21,130
Then get a cellular automaton out of this and then take scaling and recover QFT, non-interacting QFT at least.

112
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:28,190
So start with a few axioms about information processing, recover mechanics from that.

113
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,630
Does that add to your question a little bit?

114
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,830
Yeah.

115
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,104
All I'm trying to do is tie this back into some of the live streams that we've done in the past.

116
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:41,500
And I know I use different language.

117
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:49,092
I am not a scientist and I've not studied quantum other than sort of in passing ways.

118
00:12:49,146 --> 00:13:07,064
But I do think that what this spoke to me about was something that I've always tried to include, which is that there's the figure it out piece, which to me is the conceptual and the meaning part that Chris talked about very clearly here.

119
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:09,320
And then there's the outing of the figure.

120
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:27,264
There's this sort of physical edge and boundary that if you don't have an awareness of both things happening concurrently the preparation and the measure are a unitary of sort of minimum of two-state then all bets are off.

121
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:40,404
In terms of being able to think of these propagators and operators and all of the ways that we're trying to explain the situation, they're off.

122
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:42,710
So we have to have both.

123
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:50,332
We have to have that sense that there is a transfer and there is the mechanics.

124
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,160
We have to keep both juggling all the time.

125
00:13:53,310 --> 00:14:03,272
So that's where this one particular slide was really quite both bias-confirming for me.

126
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:08,856
But I think it also, as you say, is going to open up a lot that July.

127
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,108
Yeah, I agree.

128
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:15,260
I think this might be the most important or mysterious situation slide.

129
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,336
Yeah.

130
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:26,492
And it turns the pyramid, the conventional approach here's a pyramid into a top that can be spun [Laughs] essentially with a Wick rotation.

131
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:34,032
And it validates how information transfer probably gets short shrift in most of this quantum conversation.

132
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:40,808
But it's probably at least an equal to the mechanical part.

133
00:14:40,974 --> 00:14:44,250
What order are we delivering this information in?

134
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,344
At that point, I'll stop.

135
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,690
Thanks.

136
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,000
Alexey.

137
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,884
Hi, can you hear me?

138
00:14:56,002 --> 00:14:56,670
Yes.

139
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,376
My mathematics teacher in high school used to say this is beautiful, but I don't quite understand it.

140
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:10,544
So I wanted to maybe I have two questions, but I'll start with this simpler one.

141
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:20,160
So when Chris talked about the reference frame and said common language, I think in Shannon common language is the alphabet.

142
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,716
There's a receiver and Sandra and the alphabet that they share.

143
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:30,156
And then Chris said this reference frame is a physical thing like neurons or hands or mouth.

144
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:42,960
And then I got lost because if when I encode I modify something on the hard drive, then the physical components of the hard drive is the reference frame.

145
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,300
But this is not the shared language.

146
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,812
So that's my first question.

147
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,190
Maybe I'll stop here.

148
00:15:51,120 --> 00:16:01,440
I understand we're dealing in metaphors, but I want to understand that the reference frame up or down, if Bob and Alice understand it similarly, then is that really physical?

149
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:08,064
I think answer is that Chris would probably give a better answer…

150
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:09,932
Start from the beginning, Ander. Go.

151
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:15,952
… is that both are true at the same time.

152
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:18,448
I think Chris would give you a better answer.

153
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:31,220
But the semantics, or sorry, the [inaudible], which a reference frame has, to have physical embodiment and that's a piece of hardware.

154
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,810
It's a neuron or something.

155
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:41,096
In this case, it's your free choice of the spin axis, and that's your reference frame.

156
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:45,272
But at the same time, it's it's a physical it's a physical piece of hardware.

157
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:50,640
So reference frames are both the piece of hardware but also a piece of semantics.

158
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,284
So if I take it from the language I don't quite understand to computer science.

159
00:16:56,332 --> 00:17:06,036
So if Alice and Bob communicate through a piece of memory, whether it's Random Access Memory hard drive, then Alice encodes something on that hard drive and Bob reads from the hard drive.

160
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:12,164
So in that sense, they understand how to encode and decode, but they use the same physical piece that's the reference frame.

161
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:13,370
Would that be correct?

162
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,930
I might just add one again.

163
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:27,740
Continuing with the computer science and the Shannon alphabet, let's just say that these are plain text character encodings.

164
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:39,600
And so they share the same set of character A through Z encodings that is reflected somewhere physically.

165
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:50,304
And so if a message were sent from another letter, it wouldn't render properly.

166
00:17:50,352 --> 00:18:00,230
It's like outside, they couldn't differentiate omega from zeta because they only have the A through Z software pack.

167
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:14,060
And so there's an informational distinguishment that's facilitated by the information that's classically inscribed on the screen, the memory.

168
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:23,870
And there is an embodied physical as well as a semantic aspect to that situation.

169
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,364
All right, I think I'm getting closer to understanding.

170
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:37,052
So, to move away from computer science, if Ellis is a painter, she took a brush, dipped it in red paint and painted on the canvas red.

171
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:40,844
And Bob has the same understanding of red as Ellis.

172
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:42,464
And then he looked at the canvas and red.

173
00:18:42,502 --> 00:18:42,704
Red.

174
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:48,592
Then it is both the physical mark on the canvas and the symbol of red.

175
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:49,410
Right?

176
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,104
Yes.

177
00:18:51,222 --> 00:19:06,888
And if somebody had red green colorblindness that physical apparatus was not able to informationally distinguish, then they couldn't make this Wick rotation into the quantum cognitive space.

178
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:13,160
They wouldn't be able to detect that there was a red figure painted on a green background.

179
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,108
A key component here is that the reference frame is inside of the agent.

180
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:31,410
If you are colorblind, there is something physical inside of your head or your eyes or whatever, that does not allow you to see the difference.

181
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:40,320
So your semantics are affected ultimately by a physical piece of hardware.

182
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:47,700
Yeah, maybe I use the bad example, because color actually is computed in the brain and colorblindness is not necessarily physical.

183
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,708
Okay.

184
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:50,656
But I think I get it closer.

185
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:59,560
But if I may ask another question, I get lost with a saying that preparation and measurement are...they have to happen both.

186
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,308
And that when you prepare or when you read, you modify.

187
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:08,004
So I am okay with the act of writing, the act of encoding.

188
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:16,844
So when I encode something such as I mark red on the canvas or I write to the hard drive A, I modify the hard drive.

189
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:24,476
That is true, but if I am asking a question right, I am not modifying anything on the canvas.

190
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:29,772
So in what way the act of asking the question or preparation is modifying the qubit.

191
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:31,200
This is where I'm lost.

192
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,744
Does that make sense?

193
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:41,444
Yeah, I think this is exactly a question I asked to Chris in in the stream, so I can't quite remember his answer.

194
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:44,260
But I think it was basically that they're completely dual pictures.

195
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:59,180
Duality in the sense of they're both two ways of looking at the same thing, evolving towards the future, or you have time symmetry.

196
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,990
You can do either.

197
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:02,892
Yeah.

198
00:21:02,946 --> 00:21:17,772
So I myself am slightly confused by the very...but I think the answer is that they are pointing at the same the picture of, or am I preparing?

199
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:19,440
Are just completely dual.

200
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,648
Do you remember that, Daniel?

201
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,308
Yeah.

202
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:24,596
Okay.

203
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:29,430
I'll give a different angle than the formal duality relationship.

204
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:38,436
So let's think about our measuring device is going to be a carpet, and we're interested in whether somebody has walked on the carpet.

205
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:45,460
So to prepare the carpet, we comb it very nicely in one direction.

206
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:51,740
And I'm sure there's analogies there with the preparation of qubits in a quantum computer.

207
00:21:51,890 --> 00:22:01,288
But we're going to comb the carpet as an act of preparation, and then something is going to happen.

208
00:22:01,394 --> 00:22:10,450
Maybe it's a split second later, and so we're very confident that it should be still nicely combed, or maybe it's going to be a whole working day later.

209
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:25,480
But now we're going to take that probe, the tip, whatever it may be, and we're going to run it along the carpet, and we're going to measure the state of the direction of the fibers of the carpet.

210
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:38,460
So if we didn't prepare the measurements, we wouldn't have a calibrated reference point to know how things had even changed.

211
00:22:40,000 --> 00:23:05,568
And so there's a cycle of preparing the apparatus through something like a calibration or at least like an emptying of memory, to be able to then make an observation and to have that observation have the kind of meaning that we would have expected, like purge the photo detector, make the measurement.

212
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:06,964
Now you have to purge it again.

213
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:08,048
That's the preparation.

214
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:09,620
What do you think, Alexey?

215
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:19,332
That is a beautiful metaphor, and I dig that, except I think I heard Chris say that when you prepare, you may qubit into up or down.

216
00:23:19,386 --> 00:23:22,936
And this is what I'm lost, because when you comb the carpet, you don't do that.

217
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:24,744
You don't put the footstep on it.

218
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:26,484
In fact, there may not be any footstep.

219
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:26,936
Right.

220
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,972
And this is where I'm missing, I think, in quantum physics as well.

221
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:42,912
If you measure the cause and effect, relationships are broken here for me, if in my act of preparation, I'm opening my canvas to read the message, but I do not know what the message will be, I'm game.

222
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:52,020
But if he's saying that when I prepare, I modify the carpet such that it becomes either up or down, actually not blank, but up or down.

223
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,220
Then I'm lost.

224
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,852
You have to comb the carpet up or down.

225
00:23:56,986 --> 00:23:58,976
There's no blank carpet.

226
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:03,376
So you have an Etch A Sketch.

227
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:25,980
You could either make all the pixels white and then you'd be able to measure a message in the dark or you can make all the message dark or the slate dark, and then you could be able to measure something that was light, but you pick a direction of polarization in your preparation or calibration step so that deviations from that can be the measurement.

228
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,700
So you're saying carpet is binary?

229
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,160
Carpet doesn't have multiple states.

230
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,680
Carpet can only have two states.

231
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,304
So if I prepare it, I effectively put it in one of those states.

232
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:44,320
Well, let's say we had the carpet at a 45 degree angle.

233
00:24:44,480 --> 00:25:00,410
Mathematically we could describe that as a mixed state, and it may not be the most effective for measuring the movement of people across the carpet, but yeah, you could define it or comb it that way.

234
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:09,130
If it were only a binary, it wouldn't be a qubit then it would be a classical bit.

235
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,372
Actually, yeah, Ander, go for it.

236
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,430
Yeah.

237
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:26,850
If I recall in the lecture a couple of slides more, we briefly talked about it, like ten minutes ago.

238
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:34,480
By preparing, you are choosing an axis, and whatever you decide, up or down in that axis.

239
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,390
Now, that doesn't mean that the environment gets to do its own thing, right?

240
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:49,672
And superposition of outcomes, but at least you're measuring that axis, right?

241
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:54,600
So it's going to be either up or down in the two pictures.

242
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:06,110
I just want to say a few words on screens, on the Feynman diagrams and maybe clarify the question a little more.

243
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,300
Dean.

244
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:13,976
On this.

245
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:15,128
Really interesting.

246
00:26:15,294 --> 00:26:31,032
I don't know how metaphorically you could explain the carpet as a wave, but I think once you get away from the it's up or down, that possibility enters the conversation.

247
00:26:31,176 --> 00:26:47,292
And the only reason I wonder whether or not metaphorically the wave aspect of that can be included in how you're describing the carpet is that Chris spent quite a bit of time on the all possible paths argument.

248
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:54,588
And in particular, and I love this, when Alice isn't looking.

249
00:26:54,694 --> 00:27:00,790
Well, in that wave equation, how could Alice not be looking?

250
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,554
That's what gets real.

251
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:14,826
I mean, Alice could not be looking if it's binary, if it's or up or down, but if it's wave, it's on it's a unitary propagator.

252
00:27:17,926 --> 00:27:28,702
I'm not sure how she takes her eyes off of this preparation measure thing that's going off all the time.

253
00:27:28,836 --> 00:27:51,570
So this is actually what I consider to be a feature or an opportunity or an opening in the sense that from a strictly information transfer piece not a mechanical piece now, not a physical thing from an information transfer piece, maybe the carpet can be metaphorically understood as a wave.

254
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,842
That the eyes of Alice or whoever's doing the preparing and the measuring, Bob, Alice, I don't care, Peaches...that there is actually a difference, then, between something that is exchanged and something that is informationally transferred.

255
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:15,820
And again, I don't think that the four of us here sitting right now are going to resolve that.

256
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:38,098
But I wonder if part of the difficulty in this is finding the physical metaphor that explains the theoretical transfer in such a way that both breaks the symmetry and holds it.

257
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:40,094
Because again, we're back to gripper and grip.

258
00:28:40,142 --> 00:28:46,438
We're back to figuring it out and outing the physical figures in the state that we're in.

259
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,542
And we have to do both at once.

260
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:53,542
So again, Daniel, you're the creative guy.

261
00:28:53,596 --> 00:28:57,770
How do you turn your carpet metaphor into a wave equation?

262
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:06,230
Maybe there's a subwoofer in the room or maybe somebody is waving the carpet.

263
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:20,350
But what you said about what is exchanged and what is transferred, maybe the transfer is the classical component.

264
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:27,038
I don't know which one will be exchange or transferred, but one of them is the classical inscription.

265
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:31,362
That's how many gigabytes were written or read to the hard drive.

266
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:36,630
But what's exchanged, let's just say, are the semantics of meaning.

267
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:52,122
And given an appropriate co-preparation, maybe only one bit needs to be transferred for the exchange of a message that was already triggered to be set off.

268
00:29:52,256 --> 00:30:02,574
And then also, this entire discussion, it kind of strikes me as like the Cartesian duality of our time.

269
00:30:02,772 --> 00:30:13,890
But rather than mind and body, it's the physicality of information syntax and the metaphysicality of information semantics.

270
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:23,480
And that's these kind of two worlds with their own physics and metaphysics that we're trying to connect.

271
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:31,670
And it's like, similarly well, how does the information world cause something physical?

272
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,070
How does the physical cause something informational?

273
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:49,710
And I think that the entire journey that the course and everyone is on is physics as information processing, those as a qualified and distinguished but minimum of two set.

274
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,990
Alexey?

275
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:52,686
Yeah.

276
00:30:52,788 --> 00:30:53,806
Thank you so much.

277
00:30:53,908 --> 00:30:54,718
Can you hear me?

278
00:30:54,804 --> 00:30:55,440
Yeah.

279
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,106
Thinking out loud?

280
00:30:58,372 --> 00:31:05,058
But I think the way to get closer to understanding in my head is to let go of the metaphor of asking a question, right?

281
00:31:05,144 --> 00:31:10,594
So if Alexey is talking to Daniel through Zoom and I pose even a closed question, up or down.

282
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:16,886
So I formulated the question and released it into Zoom space.

283
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:20,294
And then I'm silent and I opened my listening to your answer.

284
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:24,040
But you, Daniel, have agency to say up or down.

285
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:28,138
I do not have any effect on whether you will say up or down.

286
00:31:28,224 --> 00:31:28,906
Right?

287
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:29,930
That's the difference.

288
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,410
So me asking you a question does not modify the answer.

289
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,398
You decide.

290
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:36,566
Alice talking to Bob.

291
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:40,106
Bob has the agency to answer the question, not Alice.

292
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,346
And that's where I'm stuck.

293
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:45,950
So I don't know if asking a question continues to be a good metaphor.

294
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:50,000
Preparing the instrument for measurement is maybe better.

295
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,550
But actually, Alice is not asking Bob.

296
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,726
Alice is acting on a qubit.

297
00:31:55,918 --> 00:31:56,658
Right.

298
00:31:56,824 --> 00:32:03,762
And qubit is a simple thing that, you know, can literally physically be up or down, I guess.

299
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:07,890
And so that's maybe, maybe that's the answer that Alice is not asking Bob. Alice does something to the qubit and because qubit can be up or down, then that's no longer asking a question.

300
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,460
Asking a question implies your correspondent can tell you anything.

301
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:40,154
When we're dealing with the very sophisticated process of natural language question asking, I think we're dealing with something that's orders of composition above the kind of binary ask.

302
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,340
So I agree with that.

303
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:57,302
It's almost like Alice prepares the photoreceptor so its slate is refreshed and then it's the photon or the light emitting object that has the agency to send the photon or not.

304
00:32:57,436 --> 00:33:08,262
I mean, maybe the preparation occurs and then no one comes back to check whether or not agency was even exerted.

305
00:33:08,406 --> 00:33:32,946
And I think when we really focus on the nanoprobe like atomic force microscopy, really tracing with a super fine tip over the surface of something, or scattering X rays, when we really think about the moment of information transfer, we realize like, nothing comes for free.

306
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:44,982
And I think that this question asking framework, other than really conveniently rederriving quantum mechanics in 1 hour incredibly helps us understand that we don't get to ask it for free in terms of time.

307
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:46,134
We don't get to ask it for free in terms of energy.

308
00:33:48,124 --> 00:33:59,318
And we don't get to ask free-floating questions where the question and or agentic responder are not involved already in a semantics.

309
00:33:59,494 --> 00:34:09,310
So I think it's calling attention to the components of an experiment or a question or an opening.

310
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:22,260
But I agree that it's not always as simple as a binary question, but in the special simple basal case, it does start there.

311
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:35,010
Ander, do you want to look at any of the participant submitted questions, if there was any that struck your let me finish real quick.

312
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,360
I had like maybe five minutes to wrap this up.

313
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:43,986
And this, I think, is going to, at least in part, answer one of Dean's concerns.

314
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:50,822
So the next thing we should very briefly cover, let's talk a little bit about Holographic screens.

315
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:57,254
And also this is the paper on the physical meaning of Holographic principle.

316
00:34:57,302 --> 00:35:01,440
So let's take a look at also this picture from that paper.

317
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:20,722
This is the Holographic boundary and Landauer's principle and all these thermodynamic constraints on information processing necessitate the breakdown of this boundary in terms of free energy extraction sectors, memory sectors and so on.

318
00:35:20,856 --> 00:35:31,480
And by the way, if you read the paragraphs around this picture, there's more details on how the time QRF is induced, but we'll leave that as it is for now.

319
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:43,130
Dean, what I meant by this answering your concern. Your concern was that you don't see how Alice can take off her eyes from the picture.

320
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,634
But that's precisely what's going on here, right?

321
00:35:46,752 --> 00:35:57,866
There's a sector that's being observed, which is a subset of these qubits that are being observed, but presumably she has the freedom to say, hey, this sector.

322
00:35:57,978 --> 00:36:07,490
Now I declare as my observation sector, this I declare as my memory sector, this I declare as my thermal free energy extraction sector.

323
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:26,046
So it is because of these fundamental limits on the amount of information processing, it is not true that she can she doesn't have an idealized Laplacian, if you wish, access to all the degrees of freedom.

324
00:36:26,098 --> 00:36:31,722
She can only observe, finally, a finite amount of stuff.

325
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:37,870
So she is forced to take her eyes off at least part of the system, at least for a while, right?

326
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:46,400
Because otherwise all those energy and time constraints that Daniel was just mentioning, you know, they're not...you have to abide by those.

327
00:36:49,490 --> 00:37:07,720
A few things that Chris mentioned in the last lecture when it came to this holographic screen is, well, number one, that all the information exchange is mediated by bits here at the qubits, at this holographic screen.

328
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:15,746
This in turn enforces a finiteness in the information transfer, if you wish.

329
00:37:15,778 --> 00:37:20,138
There is not an infinite amount of information in finite space.

330
00:37:20,224 --> 00:37:44,130
Even if you were to pack it at Plankian density, which is presumably the limit that black holes achieve, it's still a finite amount of information in a finite amount [Zoom interference - could not understand - of so if you have finite ones, you are taking] The other is the following.

331
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:52,930
And again, Chris will deal with this at greater detail in perhaps lecture 5, I think maybe 4.

332
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,554
But it's the notion of emergent spacetime, which is that A and B separately.

333
00:37:57,602 --> 00:38:13,878
So you think of these are presumably the internal degrees of freedom, what's going on inside of A, Alice, at an abstract level, there may not be a notion of space, but notion of space emerges at the boundary.

334
00:38:14,054 --> 00:38:23,040
And that's not easy to explain, I think, presumably has to do with and stuff like that.

335
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:37,970
And I don't know the full details myself, but for now, that's one of the key things that Chris mentioned, which is that an agent may not have space, but it may emerge boundary.

336
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:48,486
The last thing, and I'm glad that to see that this was mentioned already, so it saves us time.

337
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:49,750
I don't have to say it again.

338
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,110
Take us a minute.

339
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,938
And this again answers your can you.

340
00:38:56,944 --> 00:39:00,090
Just turn off your video under just so you don't have lag?

341
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,354
Yeah.

342
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:01,818
Thank you.

343
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:02,620
1 second.

344
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:07,674
Yes.

345
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:09,162
Can you yeah me.

346
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:10,300
Go for it.

347
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,054
This notion of Feynman diagrams, right?

348
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:21,150
So what is this whole thing about unitary evolution or preparation?

349
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:41,218
The scattering picture as Alice preparing as her, of her boundary, and writing it into her memory, and then measuring it at some point in the future, requires that you consider the possible things that happened to that preparation.

350
00:39:41,394 --> 00:39:41,734
Okay.

351
00:39:41,772 --> 00:39:53,226
So if there's some amount of time passes, you prepared your state at time T, you look at it again at time T plus dT, you have to take into account all the possible histories, clearly, [inaudible] of the system, or at least that part of the system.

352
00:39:59,456 --> 00:40:07,610
Writing, it's just saying, I prepared it here, now it's up to B what happens until the next time I look at it, up to the environment.

353
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,766
So in that unitary evolution, I consider all the possibilities.

354
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:22,434
Right, and that's exactly so.

355
00:40:22,472 --> 00:40:24,530
Let's just look at the conclusion.

356
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,758
We will leave it there for now.

357
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,630
We can open up the discussion.

358
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,480
So there's two things that are now, where was this?

359
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,474
Go ahead.

360
00:40:40,592 --> 00:40:44,138
Yeah, I understand.

361
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:45,660
Or I think I understand.

362
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:54,320
I think I understand that if I'm looking at on or if I'm attending to on, I'm not looking at off.

363
00:40:55,010 --> 00:41:08,238
What I saw in that wave thing with Feynman was I could also be looking at the switch where the two different places of on and off exist.

364
00:41:08,414 --> 00:41:22,710
And when I'm looking at the entire switch, I'm not looking at one or the other, I'm looking at that basal, as Daniel described, that basal opportunity of both.

365
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:35,450
And I think that on that...I don't know how that ties in with reference frames, but on that level that says, I'm now looking at all possible in that moment.

366
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:46,570
I don't think, at least from that perspective, that reference frame I'm zooming into an on or off binary choice decision branch.

367
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:52,420
I'm still at that place where the preparation allows for both.

368
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,650
I'm literally not taking my eyes off at that place.

369
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:12,342
So, again, I'm not arguing with you because what you described and the image that you brought up, all that is is bringing it down to a granular level and saying if I'm paying attention to this, I can't be paying attention to that.

370
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:25,820
But if I physically, from a transfer perspective, back up so that I can see both possibilities at once, I don't know that I'm taking my eye off of either.

371
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,634
That's the only thing that I was bringing up.

372
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:37,342
Now, of course, Chris will probably hear this and go, Dean, you got to go and rethink this whole thing through, which is great because I'm here to learn.

373
00:42:37,476 --> 00:42:55,126
But again, if I misspoke about what I was trying to say, it wasn't because I don't see those moments when I'm directing my preparation over here.

374
00:42:55,228 --> 00:43:07,062
And that's going to give me one kind of measurement versus if I'm taking in a larger time frame or larger spatial frame or larger holographic screen.

375
00:43:07,116 --> 00:43:11,322
Like I don't even know how to describe it because I just don't have the words for it yet.

376
00:43:11,376 --> 00:43:13,194
But there you go.

377
00:43:13,232 --> 00:43:16,598
I just want to be clear that I'm not, I don't think I'm confused.

378
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:25,098
I just want to know the difference between when I'm looking at on or off and when I'm looking at the entire switch.

379
00:43:25,194 --> 00:43:26,160
That's all.

380
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:31,570
I'll add one point on this slide.

381
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:40,530
It goes back to some of the earliest points that Chris made about the ontological primacy of communication.

382
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,440
Space and time arise from communicating agents.

383
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:51,750
Communicating agents are not something that we have to squeeze into an a priori spatial temple framework.

384
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:58,486
So quantum mechanics saying here on the slide is about measurement, not mechanical motion.

385
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:09,680
So we don't need to wait around or speculate as to how from the "mechanical or physical hard drive," measurement arises or happens.

386
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:23,780
We start with the measurements occurring and then different kinds of sophisticated agents can conceptualize movement through spaces and times.

387
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:34,130
And this also relates to Bayesian mechanics as a mechanics and a physics of movement on information geometric spaces.

388
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:49,910
And so the physics can be projected by appropriately prepared agents, but we don't necessarily need to wonder about how that agent fits within a mechanical setting.

389
00:44:50,070 --> 00:45:04,640
And I guess this is where humans are, with the "I am a strange loop, Gödel, Escher, Bach, gripper, and gripped mystery" of being able to see it multiple ways [1979, Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas Hofstadter].

390
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,880
Ander, do you want to go to the questions?

391
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:18,818
Yeah, let me just say closing remarks here.

392
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:48,726
I think what Chris' punching line of the paper "Free Energy Principle for Quantum Systems," which is formally speaking, it's similar to relaxation to thermodynamical equilibrium, which is that if you have an isolated bipartite quantum system, and A and B are going to turn, they are going to tend towards reference frame alignment and therefore entanglement.

393
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:55,370
And these two things are basically very intimately related.

394
00:45:55,950 --> 00:46:01,470
By aligning the reference frames, A and B will be driven towards maximal entanglement.

395
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:10,754
So should I take a look at the questions and open this?

396
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:28,774
Yeah, so if you guys have access to the Q and A, there's been more questions in the last, you know, bringing you guys'attention to a few of them.

397
00:46:28,972 --> 00:47:15,894
This is where Chris links to the papers of Rovelli [1993, Statistical mechanics of gravity and the thermodynamical origin of time], which I mentioned earlier in passing when we were talking about the preparation, measurement cycle and the notion of thermal time or subjective time, if you wish. And somebody brought up this remark that performance and calculations here you can relate t, time, to a change in the volume of phase space, or more precisely, the amount of available states in the state space, with a log and whatever, with respect to the energy.

398
00:47:16,012 --> 00:47:16,680
Right?

399
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:26,794
So this restates the idea that we're talking about earlier, right?

400
00:47:26,832 --> 00:47:38,270
Like your intrinsic subjective time being this dS, the iterative thermal time, basically speaking, that is observer dependent.

401
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:43,840
So that's a good question to take a look at.

402
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,442
There's another one.

403
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:51,730
What is meant by local free of choice?

404
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,842
This is a very good answer too.

405
00:47:53,896 --> 00:47:56,882
Local here means a time [?] boundary, right?

406
00:47:57,016 --> 00:48:03,090
Isolated systems are idealized by definition.

407
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:06,434
There's always going to be an observer interacting with an environment.

408
00:48:06,482 --> 00:48:09,874
So a purely isolated system is an idealization.

409
00:48:10,002 --> 00:48:14,266
So what local free choice means here is exactly what we said earlier, right?

410
00:48:14,288 --> 00:48:19,210
That you get to choose the spin axis at the boundary qubits.

411
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:33,790
There were some nice questions relating Markov blankets to the scattering picture.

412
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:38,340
So this one, for instance, is also worth a look.

413
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:46,222
So somebody brought up this very good point about the scattering matrix.

414
00:48:46,366 --> 00:48:54,662
Scattering matrix is by the way, let's not think about it mathematically, let's think about the picture, right?

415
00:48:54,796 --> 00:49:00,806
You imagine two particles that are interacting and far away, they are free, right?

416
00:49:00,828 --> 00:49:04,330
They are spatially separated and interacting free particles.

417
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:08,074
And somehow at some point they come to interact, right?

418
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:15,600
And then you have to write all the Feynman diagrams for all the exchange of bosons or whatever the interaction is.

419
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:20,462
And that's how you would compute the amplitudes for the scattering process, right?

420
00:49:20,516 --> 00:49:27,940
How those two particles that were separated came to interact and then they go off to infinity again.

421
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:39,540
Chris here brings up the point that in a sense, how you define a Markov blanket is in the opposite direction, right?

422
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:44,578
Markov blanket in at least in the graph theory sense, you start with a "node."

423
00:49:44,674 --> 00:49:54,298
The Markov blanket is just the set of nodes that separate in terms of conditional probability--that "node" from everyone else.

424
00:49:54,464 --> 00:50:04,214
And then you can have edges which are going to be directly causal networks, so acyclic, no cycles-directed edges.

425
00:50:04,342 --> 00:50:05,760
That's how the graph looks.

426
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:12,766
And you build up, essentially you're taking the opposite picture, right?

427
00:50:12,788 --> 00:50:24,526
You start with a node, which in this case would be the interaction, and then you build up to infinity as opposed to in the scattering picture, which is like, you start with particles not interacting at infinity, you see how they go off to infinity again, and then the interaction is in the middle.

428
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:37,640
So obviously the answer is a bit more precise, but it's worth taking a look at.

429
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:46,326
And this is an interesting one too, of a symmetrical input-output bandwidth.

430
00:50:46,358 --> 00:50:55,722
So again, if you think of it as a graph, nothing is constraining you to say that you're going to have more incoming arrows than outcoming arrows into the boundary.

431
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:56,400
Right?

432
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,430
That's just the way it is.

433
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,066
If you think of it, a graph, there is no symmetry imposed.

434
00:51:03,258 --> 00:51:06,750
The only natural sense of symmetry would be energy conservation.

435
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:24,678
And that's exactly what Chris says here, right, which is that, and I'm not sure myself how you relate it to a conservation...of not quite information, but I wouldn't know how to phrase it myself.

436
00:51:24,844 --> 00:51:27,206
I would just take a look at the question.

437
00:51:27,308 --> 00:51:35,590
But basically, no, there is a priori nothing that necessitates symmetry input-output in Markov blankets.

438
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:56,350
But if you are to talk about any sort of symmetry, the natural language would not be in terms of incoming versus outgoing arrows, but rather energy conservation, which we saw is a close casting of information transfer, right, because of the minimal requirements for action to rewrite a qubit.

439
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:18,950
And the last question that I would like to bring your guys'attention to, I mean, all of them are great, but we have finite resources and finite times on internet would be this one.

440
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,350
Okay.

441
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,480
And I'm not going to go into too much detail.

442
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:29,340
But this is again about the local...wait 1 second.

443
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,806
Turn on my camera, by the way.

444
00:52:42,828 --> 00:52:45,180
Go for it.

445
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:56,004
And also people can see all the questions on the website, right?

446
00:52:56,042 --> 00:52:57,750
And submit their own as well.

447
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,750
Yes, for sure.

448
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:05,370
So now I lost track of the question that I wanted to show you guys.

449
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,752
I think it's this one over here.

450
00:53:07,806 --> 00:53:09,720
Yes, exactly.

451
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:10,520
This one.

452
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:16,572
By the way, all of them are good, even this one, the Holographic principle, does it make it easier to compute any physics problems?

453
00:53:16,706 --> 00:53:19,564
Well, please take a look at Chris's answer.

454
00:53:19,602 --> 00:53:30,770
But all I can say is that these ideas of holography, I'm not an expert, I'm not a condensed matter physicist, but they're used all over physics nowadays, not necessarily just in high energy.

455
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,884
I know that condensed matter theorists use them all the time.

456
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:42,532
So the answer to this is an emphatic yes, the Holographic, at least Ada Saft [?] is used all over.

457
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:50,890
But again, I'm not a physicist myself, so this is the last question I wanted to bring your attention to.

458
00:53:51,980 --> 00:54:24,000
And here, Chris, this may be the one worth taking a look at, in order to answer all the earlier speculations that we had about time, internal clock, here, somebody asks about synchrony and just the perception of time with respect to external clocks, I suppose.

459
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:38,064
And Chris here answers that at the end of the day, even if you're using an external clock, everything that you perceive outside at the end of the day has to be in terms of an internal clock.

460
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:45,572
Any information incoming, you're going to have to make causal sense of it, you're going to have to write it into a memory in terms of an internal clock. You're never going to be able to, so to speak, increase your precision of the passage of time by taking that external clock, even if you think it's more precise than anything you have inside.

461
00:55:00,626 --> 00:55:02,928
I think that's basically what his answer amounts to.

462
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:21,990
And this is formally related to all this frame halting problem stuff where because as a system, you're never going to give an infinitely precise, I'm speaking very loosely here...an infinitely precise description of yourself.

463
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:27,336
You're never going to formally speaking again, that's what it amounts to.

464
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:46,780
You're never going to be able to outdo your internal clock by trying to leverage something external like an atomic clock, that even if you think it's more precise, at the end of the day, your own subjective perception of information will depend on internal clocks.

465
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:55,382
So we can open up things.

466
00:55:55,436 --> 00:56:01,770
Any concluding remarks and any other Alexey or Dean or anyone else who may have joined?

467
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:05,100
I don't have anything else to say at this point.

468
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:11,358
I mean, where or when are we?

469
00:56:11,524 --> 00:56:19,390
We had session one with a real big historical overview.

470
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:44,706
Section two, we focused on the measurability question, which is answered with a question, and we talked about some of the constraints of question asking, namely that it takes time, it takes energy, you have to ask it to somebody or something on an interface, and it has to have a semantic quantum reference frame.

471
00:56:44,898 --> 00:56:57,370
And this is dovetailing with a free energy principle, of course, because the free energy principle, as it says in the syllabus, to what does the free energy principle apply?

472
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,662
And Chris says, "everything measurable" and that's why it's a theory of everything that we choose to measure and model, not ontological statements about what is.

473
00:57:08,388 --> 00:57:13,460
And then where are we heading into in Session 3?

474
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:19,410
Have you looked ahead, Ander, or do you want me to read what's in the syllabus?

475
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:20,530
Please do.

476
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:31,094
Yeah, I think basically my short answer to that, and possibly my full answer also, is that it's just going to take care of the loose ends in this lecture 2.

477
00:57:31,212 --> 00:57:44,538
So this lecture 2 is a warm up to the real thing, which we need to talk more seriously about reference frames in order to get the precise picture of this quantum measurement process.

478
00:57:44,624 --> 00:57:54,954
Yeah, it says that session 3 will introduce the idea of quantum reference frames and the representation using hierarchies of binary classifiers.

479
00:57:55,082 --> 00:58:01,986
These formal structures provide a semantics for measurement and hence provide the basis for a theory of meaning for interacting agents.

480
00:58:02,168 --> 00:58:13,070
The language of QRFs allows a particularly straightforward and intuitive definition of variational free energy, and so allows a fully general quantum formulation of the FEP.

481
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:21,030
We will see that the FEP is a classical limit on the principle of unitarity, the fundamental principle of quantum theory.

482
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:29,750
By the way, Daniel, I'm not sure if you're busy, but I just got an email from Chris.

483
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:34,220
I think he may be watching us and I think he's just confused about the link.

484
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:40,334
Chris, I don't know if you're there still, but do you think it's worth it?

485
00:58:40,372 --> 00:58:43,694
We send him the link real quick if he can come for a few minutes.

486
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:44,480
Yeah.

487
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:50,640
I'll send Chris the Zoom link now.

488
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:55,620
Yeah, hold on to your qubit, Chris, we're coming.

489
00:58:56,230 --> 00:59:00,738
Yeah, so let's give him a few minutes.

490
00:59:00,824 --> 00:59:05,506
Maybe he's still watching and he'll answer the questions better than I could.

491
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:10,070
Well, Daniel is sending him a lifeline.

492
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:30,938
Just from the rookie perspective on this. Session one seemed like there was a big time window, like the historical piece over using an external clock and a timeline.

493
00:59:31,114 --> 00:59:51,838
This one felt like the parabola and the up or down and the entanglement was almost instantaneous in terms of that Planck length that we were really holding up as comparative to that timeline, that chronological timeline.

494
00:59:52,014 --> 01:00:01,526
And so I'm guessing that now that we've established those two as different, where does that go?

495
01:00:01,628 --> 01:00:05,880
But again, that's just the rookie's view of things.

496
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,278
Hey, Chris.

497
01:00:12,374 --> 01:00:13,020
Welcome.

498
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:14,682
Yeah, hi.

499
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:27,760
This is a very interesting discussion and it's given me some pointers as to what to emphasize at the beginning of session three.

500
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:44,980
But I can say in response to Dean's question that the time when Alice isn't looking is the time during which Bob is making his measurement and then his next preparation step.

501
01:00:45,910 --> 01:01:03,050
So if you consider again that slide that shows sort of the Feynman representation of what's happening as this unitary flow, that's what Bob is doing.

502
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:16,160
And I think Ander said that from Alice's point of view, Bob is just some quantum system and she's banged on that system by asking a question.

503
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:30,722
And now that system is doing something or other that she can't see until it, i.e., Bob, bangs on his side of the screen and she gets some information by making a measurement. So, she may be not looking for a very short period of time.

504
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:42,630
Right.

505
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,350
According to her internal clock, she's not looking for just the time it takes for one of her internal ticks to take place.

506
01:01:53,150 --> 01:02:02,486
But in general, we're not saying anything about how long that time is, right?

507
01:02:02,528 --> 01:02:29,800
If you think of this in a scattering theory way, then we're talking about the time between two protons leaving the rings on the Large Hadron Collider to the time that all the stuff that comes out of their collision is measured by the detectors, which is a nanosecond or something like that, some very short period of time.

508
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:49,370
So just think of that interval as the measure of the intrinsic time dependence, the external time dependence, of the interaction.

509
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:52,974
Someone has to do something and then someone else has to do something.

510
01:02:53,012 --> 01:03:00,030
And there's a gap between what the first person does and what they see in response.

511
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:14,290
Let's see what's the other question. The other central question that came up today was the question of why observing something requires action.

512
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:20,280
And of course, in the classical picture, observing something doesn't require any action at all.

513
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:23,960
The event just happens.

514
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:39,660
And this is the fundamental, if you will, distinction between classical and quantum theory is that making an observation in quantum theory is taking an action on the world.

515
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:57,330
And there's a lovely metaphor that's not correct in detail but it's very useful, I think, conceptually which [Werner] Heisenberg came up with to try to explain his uncertainty principle to his classical colleagues.

516
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:05,010
He said, look, suppose I'm trying to see a very small particle and measure its motion.

517
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:13,362
I have to have a microscope to see this particle and to measure its motion.

518
01:04:13,426 --> 01:04:14,966
I need to light it up.

519
01:04:14,988 --> 01:04:16,646
I need to shine some light on it.

520
01:04:16,748 --> 01:04:22,780
And those photons of light are actually impacting the thing I'm trying to see.

521
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:31,020
So the act of observation itself requires banging something into an object.

522
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:42,320
And when we're just looking out at the world, it's the sun that's banging the light into the object, not us.

523
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:52,340
But we can sort of merge those two systems together because it's the sun that's taking the action that lets us get some information.

524
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:59,160
But the sun is perturbing the things that we're looking at by banging photons into them.

525
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:18,874
And I think that picture of Heisenberg's is what he used to actually derive the uncertainty principle in terms of momentum and position, because banging something into something is transferring momentum to it.

526
01:05:18,912 --> 01:05:31,674
Photons transfers the momentum to the tiny particle in the microscope, and that perturbs its position on the microscope stage, which is precisely what Heisenberg is trying to measure.

527
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:35,970
So that's his point in that analogy.

528
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:40,238
Observation itself always takes action.

529
01:05:40,334 --> 01:05:48,514
And that's why observation and preparation are duals in quantum theory, because they each require a minimum one unit of action.

530
01:05:48,642 --> 01:05:56,120
And I think, Ander, you said the duality can be thought of in terms of time invariance, and that's exactly correct.

531
01:05:56,890 --> 01:06:01,346
Preparation is just measurement run backwards and vice versa.

532
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:23,390
And if you let me say a few words, I think this also answers my own confusion and the question that Alexey posed earlier, which is this duality between preparation and measurement. In your picture that you're bringing up Chris with Heisenberg...by shining photons on particle that I'm trying to observe.

533
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:30,882
These pictures of preparation and measurement are dual because in doing so, I'm constraining the system.

534
01:06:30,936 --> 01:06:33,220
In trying to measure it, I'm constraining it.

535
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:39,126
In me trying to gather information by shining photons on it what I'm really doing is I'm constraining it.

536
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:48,438
I'm just saying you can only take this moment or position.

537
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:49,720
Would that be correct?

538
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:52,778
Yeah.

539
01:06:52,864 --> 01:07:03,790
In fact, in the microscope example, it's particularly clear you're bouncing a photon off of the object, and then it's that photon that you're detecting.

540
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:06,160
Right.

541
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:11,646
There was one other question that can be answered quickly.

542
01:07:11,748 --> 01:07:25,186
It was the question about what's the reference frame that Alice is using when she's measuring up or down, measuring her spin up or down.

543
01:07:25,368 --> 01:07:36,262
And of course, there are several reference frames involved here, so let's work inwards in a real system.

544
01:07:36,396 --> 01:07:37,574
Alice is sitting here.

545
01:07:37,612 --> 01:07:50,070
She's got a Stern-Gerlach apparatus, which is a vertical magnet apparatus, and she's measuring the spin of an electron that's traveling through this Stern-Gerlach device.

546
01:07:50,230 --> 01:08:04,590
And what the Stern-Gerlach device does is orient the spin with a magnetic field that's not homogeneous, so it ends up pointing physically up as it comes through the apparatus.

547
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:09,614
So how is that apparatus oriented?

548
01:08:09,662 --> 01:08:13,250
I mean, what defines the up direction for that apparatus?

549
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:21,880
Well, in the practical setting, what defines that apparatus orientation is the Earth's gravitational field.

550
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,080
Right.

551
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:29,078
We're here in the laboratory, and the Earth's gravitational field tells us what direction is down.

552
01:08:29,164 --> 01:08:39,974
It's toward the center of the Earth, and so up is away from the center of the Earth, and that's what defines the axis for the apparatus, which is a great big piece of metal.

553
01:08:40,022 --> 01:08:43,680
So it's very responsive to the gravitational field.

554
01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:47,242
So now we can ask about Alice.

555
01:08:47,306 --> 01:08:47,534
Right.

556
01:08:47,572 --> 01:08:55,890
Alice is also embedded in this gravitational field, and she also can detect the gravitational field.

557
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:03,406
She can tell which way is down toward the center of the Earth by the force acting on her feet.

558
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:08,230
And that measurement is taking place in Alice's brain.

559
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:20,810
So in Alice's brain, there's a representation of which way is up, and that's the internal reference frame of Alice that lets her do the experiment.

560
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:35,054
If she was freely floating in space, but the apparatus was anchored to the gravitational field, she wouldn't be able to tell that it was anchored to the gravitational field.

561
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:47,650
That's Einstein's point, that Einstein makes in all of those experiments, where he has observers flying around in spacecraft that they have to have their own reference frame.

562
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:54,500
What Einstein didn't emphasize was that reference frame is in their head.

563
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:57,220
It's encoded by their nervous system.

564
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:17,740
So I think it was Daniel who said this exactly correctly, that the physical object in her head, the actual neural network that tells her which way the gravitational field is, is itself a semantic object.

565
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:24,750
That's what gives the word up and down meaning for Alice.

566
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:27,914
What do I mean when I say the word meaning?

567
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:30,510
I mean, it lets her take some action.

568
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:39,086
Semantics boils down to actionability if it gives things significance.

569
01:10:39,278 --> 01:10:59,160
And this was the point that [Gregory] Bateson was making when he said, "differences that make a difference" for an organism, something is meaningful if it actually makes a difference for what I can do in this world that I'm trying to survive in.

570
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:02,806
So I'll leave it at that.

571
01:11:02,908 --> 01:11:08,550
But this is very useful for leading off the next session.

572
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:11,850
So thank you very much for all that discussion.

573
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:13,578
Awesome.

574
01:11:13,744 --> 01:11:14,326
Thank you.

575
01:11:14,368 --> 01:11:21,790
I guess if I could say one thing here is that let me scroll back up to the three points early in the slides.

576
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:29,982
Differences that make a difference would tell you that you require action to perturb a system and measure.

577
01:11:30,126 --> 01:11:39,650
And then the semantics or the contextuality that may be encoded in the nervous system would tell you what is the difference that is being made.

578
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,026
Would that be correct?

579
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:41,986
Yeah.

580
01:11:42,168 --> 01:11:42,994
Right.

581
01:11:43,192 --> 01:11:45,540
What tells you that there's a difference there?

582
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:49,846
It's what you're able to detect and represent internally.

583
01:11:49,918 --> 01:11:55,542
It's almost like step one, do differently.

584
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:59,018
Step two, you have to ask it to a different thing.

585
01:11:59,184 --> 01:12:08,960
And then three, you need the semantic frame that makes A and B different; differences all the way down.

586
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:17,774
Well, we will transcribe this and fix the few patchy moments, Ander.

587
01:12:17,822 --> 01:12:30,820
We'll work together on updating the transcript so that everybody who wants to be well-prepared for the measurement of the third lecture will be absolutely in place.

588
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:35,166
Thank you, Chris, for joining.

589
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:39,150
That's a fun cap to this discussion.

590
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:41,338
So, all right, thank you.

591
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:42,490
See you all next time.

592
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:42,790
Bye.
