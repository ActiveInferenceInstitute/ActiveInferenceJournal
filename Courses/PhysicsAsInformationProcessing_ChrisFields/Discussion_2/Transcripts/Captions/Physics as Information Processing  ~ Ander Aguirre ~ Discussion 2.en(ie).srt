1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,340
hello it's July 1st 2023 we're in

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,740
physics as information processing in the

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,680
second discussion so thanks all for

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,660
joining and we'll see who else comes in

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,939
if you're watching live feel free to

6
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,580
write questions in the live chat and

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,180
I'll relay them onwards so Andre thanks

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,060
and uh it would be awesome to begin with

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,980
a little bit of some overview and some

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,920
points that you wanted to get to

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,079
yeah thank you Daniel

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,420
um so good morning everyone so if you

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,760
would start

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,320
up a bit

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,800
goal with Chris

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,040
last time

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,940
so I have a few slides that I singled

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,460
out

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,219
so now we're getting to

20
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,379
uh reform reformulation of quantum

21
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,260
theory in terms of reformulation

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,600
so

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,439
opposed to the dynamical theory

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,439
and uh as we've talked in previous

25
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,820
sessions we need to

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,520
a little bit philosophically uh with the

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,820
ontology of measurement entails

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,580
um so Chris last lecture started with

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,259
these three basic ingredients

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,780
so an action

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,979
that's

32
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,080
um number one a thing to ask you about

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,140
uh this is the qubit the physical

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,939
degrees of freedom that we need to

35
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,820
perturb in some way to ask a question

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,340
and then finally mathematics a language

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,740
that makes sense a context that makes

38
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,079
sense of of that information that we got

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,280
so

40
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,240
um

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,340
I should say number one

42
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,420
that came up in the first fashion when

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,340
um I can't I can't exactly remember but

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,960
at some point we talked about what is

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,460
information and we came up with uh

46
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,538
or we brought up a definition that goes

47
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:10,860
something like this it's the nicer Dash

48
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,560
it's uh differences that make a

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,080
difference this is

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,879
um Chris told me I can remember who who

51
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,640
first coined this Dash but I think it

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,500
it's quite old at least

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,760
early early 70s anyway so number one

54
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,800
basically let's curve that part right if

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,020
I want to gather some information I need

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,239
to perturb a system somehow so I need to

57
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,900
act and this is in early in in units of

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,420
actions right so units of energy times

59
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,959
time and we provided the example of

60
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,540
productsing right which is

61
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,200
apparently near optimal from the quantum

62
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,060
perspective this is mechanically what

63
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,180
goes on in your eyes and slide comes in

64
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,800
and this is clearly the difference that

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,599
makes a difference in your in your brain

66
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,099
the second part were the physical

67
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,980
degrees of freedom so recall that

68
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,940
um

69
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,680
we had a boundary okay so this this

70
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,900
theory of of quantum mechanics as

71
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,780
measurement necessarily breaks down the

72
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,780
system into a bipartite system with a

73
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,900
boundary and

74
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,620
you are

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,580
which are a lot smaller than um then the

76
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,620
degrees of freedom of A and B

77
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,900
uh at least in terms of the dimension of

78
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,580
the Hilbert space

79
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,900
and

80
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,519
um

81
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,560
change all right

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,440
sorry can you repeat Andre

83
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,920
I repeat what sorry just last 30 seconds

84
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,980
yeah so so the second ingredient is

85
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,879
it the the physical medium in which this

86
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,819
information exchange occurs

87
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,019
um

88
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,060
where the physical decrease of Freedom

89
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,799
the qubitsar

90
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,900
um arranged and these are physically

91
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,599
perturbed in order to mediate that

92
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,060
difference that makes a difference

93
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,099
so we can think of this dually as either

94
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,260
preparing those qubits or decoding those

95
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,120
qubits

96
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,959
and then finally there was the notion of

97
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,160
um

98
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,199
the reference frame

99
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,400
okay

100
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,400
so this Theory necessitates

101
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,940
a free choice of the agent of a

102
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,340
reference frame and physically what this

103
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,199
amounts to is three choice of

104
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,300
uh a measurement axis for those for

105
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,520
those uh qubits so we can think of

106
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,560
measuring disease being

107
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,620
uh in those periods on the binary so you

108
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,020
know that that requires a free choice of

109
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,479
of that axis

110
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,540
and this you know amounts to your

111
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,160
reference frame the context in which

112
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,860
those measurements are are performed on

113
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,000
one

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,520
extreme case we have that if if those

115
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,620
references are perfectly aligned

116
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,139
then the exchange of information is is

117
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,380
noiseless uh there was it somewhere over

118
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,820
here I think

119
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,880
I can't quite recall but generically

120
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,740
this these two reference frames of Alice

121
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,080
and Bob A and B are not exactly the same

122
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,120
they get to they get to choose the

123
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,740
reference frames I think it's all the

124
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,460
way

125
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,979
on the bottom actually right

126
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,419
so they can be aligned if they're

127
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,460
aligned they are exchanging noiseless

128
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,419
information right there is no

129
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:36,479
Randomness if they are not

130
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,479
superposition

131
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,580
and that's when you're gonna get you

132
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,740
know probabilities in in the outcomes

133
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,259
trivial probabilities

134
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,039
so parts are good

135
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,180
yes okay

136
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,960
so I have a few more comments of the

137
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,620
main things okay I'll take me just a few

138
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,120
minutes and then we can chat back and

139
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,500
forth

140
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,840
perhaps this slide is

141
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,380
interesting important I remember this is

142
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,520
where I asked the question myself

143
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,580
because I was I mean I still you know

144
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,139
it's it's not easy to wrap your hair

145
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,479
around what's going on here so we said

146
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,639
that measurement and preparation are

147
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,100
completely dual pictures

148
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,919
so this is going to be expanded on in

149
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,300
the next lecture

150
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,639
but

151
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,120
a jerk uh corollary of that is that

152
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,639
if you prepare crystal in similar terms

153
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,380
if you prepare something in a certain

154
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,940
State and then you

155
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,919
uh measure it right away you should

156
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,240
expect that it's still in that state

157
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,900
right so uh intuitively speaking this

158
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,740
induces the cycle right and uh where you

159
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,360
have preparation and measurement and you

160
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,539
you're back to square one so to speak

161
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,600
yeah and uh

162
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,440
in in in in generating that cycle

163
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,780
obviously there has to be some notion of

164
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,840
time right

165
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
so

166
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,419
um that's that's where

167
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,240
we're gonna have to make sense of uh the

168
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,280
distinction between internal and

169
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,080
external time if we take this

170
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,060
measurement operator and here perform

171
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,099
some operations

172
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,319
we can write it as a unitary propagator

173
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,000
from quantum mechanics which again

174
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,979
preserves information it just leaves the

175
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,560
state as it is

176
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,020
but with this little trick of the weak

177
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,560
rotation you can write it as e to the

178
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,319
measurement up to a constant and that

179
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,539
you know precisely encodes

180
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,940
at least morally speaking uh what we

181
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,740
just said right that this preparation

182
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,900
measurement thing is a cycle and more

183
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,180
importantly it gets rid of this T

184
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,759
external time

185
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,080
and

186
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,660
presumably

187
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,639
in in here it's going to be replaced by

188
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,220
some notion of internal time we're going

189
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,560
to have an internal time qrf

190
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,800
that is quote unquote the true

191
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,460
local time as the Observer proceeds

192
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,020
um I'm

193
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,599
not entirely certain of the details but

194
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,020
now looking at it here the beta which

195
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,840
uh presumably there's a you know the

196
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,319
beta and inverse temperature here

197
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,819
um I think this is going to be

198
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,979
intimately related to Notions of thermal

199
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,039
time this has been explored in papers by

200
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,979
rovelli

201
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,440
um called you know internal tanker revs

202
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,559
and thermal time is the way in which the

203
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,320
Observer observes the passage of time

204
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,380
uh those papers of royalty are linked in

205
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,899
the Q a by the way so I can also provide

206
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,620
links later

207
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,480
uh I think there might have been a

208
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,180
question should I stop yeah Dean go for

209
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,360
it and there's I was curious about this

210
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,200
because what I heard Chris start this

211
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,080
session with was that he

212
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,860
was going to try to help us understand

213
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,680
when we are looking at something through

214
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,600
a mechanical lens

215
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
so quantum mechanics and to me this

216
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,519
slide was the way of addressing as he

217
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,140
said his words were characterized

218
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,019
information transfer in a Quantum

219
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,540
theoretic way that the that the

220
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,839
translation from H to m

221
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,279
took the the mechanics aspect out of the

222
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,440
change or timepiece it was the

223
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,800
purification the most theoretical form

224
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,940
of transfer of information as opposed to

225
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,000
pulling up just the one ordered or

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,160
sequenced or mechanical lens

227
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,580
did I I heard you asked the question and

228
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,380
I kind of smiled because I thought to

229
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,380
myself no I understand why Anders is

230
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,860
asking this question it's can something

231
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,200
be both gripper in this in the

232
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,220
conceptual meaning sense ontologically

233
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,700
and gripped a physical object and I

234
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,980
think what that I thought maybe I was

235
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,680
misintermining I'd like your what your

236
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,620
perspective on this is that ability to

237
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,779
go from H to m

238
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,880
is what allows us to have both the

239
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,440
mechanical

240
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,100
and the theoretical the transference in

241
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,160
its purest sense is that being able to

242
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,240
have both

243
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,620
both can be true is that what it is

244
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,720
yes for sure yeah

245
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,220
yeah

246
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,959
um yeah I I

247
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,019
much else uh to say here it's

248
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,019
it is it is true that um you can think

249
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,480
of the information transfer picture as

250
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,000
an enlargement or an addition to the

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
mechanical picture

252
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,060
and that I don't think that the

253
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,100
mechanical picture has to be just

254
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,860
you know thrown out completely I think I

255
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,540
think it's interesting to keep it to see

256
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,880
how it can be recovered from the

257
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,860
information uh

258
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,140
processing picture this reminds me

259
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,760
actually there is

260
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,779
um

261
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,000
an Italian physicist I think his name is

262
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,820
curry Bella and Dean if you want I can I

263
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,459
can link you the papers later who is

264
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,320
very fond of the information theoretical

265
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,820
approach to quantum mechanics and

266
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,560
deducing quantum mechanics from first

267
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,700
principles

268
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,459
and here is a paper

269
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,380
I think the title is physics without

270
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,100
physics or something like that where you

271
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,779
know he he treats

272
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,200
um uh this whole thing as a seller baby

273
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,480
seller automaton and

274
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,640
by taking the appropriate

275
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,480
scaling limits he derives

276
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,880
qft

277
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,660
now I'm interacting qfd so he says okay

278
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,560
let me start with some axioms how

279
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,660
information should be information

280
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,439
processing

281
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,540
I mean I'm doing very loose here then

282
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,019
get a cellular automaton out of this

283
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,160
and the tech scale and a record UFT

284
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,660
non-interacting qft at least

285
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,720
so you know start with a few axioms our

286
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,060
information processing recovery

287
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,459
mechanics from that

288
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:31,019
does that add to your question a little

289
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,040
bit

290
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,740
yeah so so all I want

291
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,959
all I'm trying to do is tie this back

292
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,519
into some of the live streams that we've

293
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,079
done in the past and I know I use

294
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,800
different language I I am not

295
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,740
a scientist and I've not studied Quantum

296
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,740
other than sort of in passing ways but I

297
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,480
do think that

298
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,079
what this spoke to me about was

299
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,760
something that I've always

300
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,800
tried to include which is that there's

301
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,160
the figure it out piece which to me is

302
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,380
the conceptual and the meaning part that

303
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,620
Chris talked about very clearly here and

304
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,240
then there's the outing of the figure

305
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,820
there's this sort of physical Edge and

306
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,779
Boundary that if you don't have an

307
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,000
awareness of both things happening

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,399
concurrently the preparation and the

309
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,480
measure

310
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,139
are a unitary absorb minimum of two

311
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,019
State then all bets are up in terms of

312
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,639
being able to

313
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,279
think of these these

314
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,600
propagators and operators and all of the

315
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,700
ways that we're trying to explain the

316
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,060
situation they're off so we have to have

317
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,260
both

318
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,500
we have to have that sense that there is

319
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,880
a transfer

320
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,040
but there are and there is the mechanics

321
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,680
we we have to keep both juggling all the

322
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,440
time so that's where I that's where this

323
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,139
one particular slide

324
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,740
was really quite uh both biased

325
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,220
confirming for me but I think it also as

326
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,160
you say is going to open up a lot that

327
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,040
July um yeah I agree I think this might

328
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,440
be the most you know important or

329
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,899
mysterious if you wish in his life

330
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,240
yeah and it turns the pyramid the

331
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,399
conventional approach here's the pyramid

332
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,139
into a top that can be spun

333
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:26,880
essentially with a rick rotation and it

334
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,339
and it validates how information

335
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,100
transfer probably gets short shrift in

336
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,500
most of this Quantum conversation but

337
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,300
it's it's probably at least an equal to

338
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,339
to the mechanical part the what what

339
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,380
order are we delivering this information

340
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,139
in

341
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,959
at that point I'll stop thanks yeah

342
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,399
foreign

343
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,660
thanks

344
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,360
um Alexi

345
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,300
hi can you hear me yep

346
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,199
uh so uh I mean I I'm an you know

347
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,820
um my mathematics teacher in high school

348
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,380
used to say this is beautiful but I

349
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,320
don't quite understand it so I I wanted

350
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,120
to maybe I have two questions but I'll

351
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,639
start with with this simpler one so when

352
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,399
Chris talked about the reference frame

353
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,760
uh and said common language you know I

354
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
think in Shannon common language is the

355
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,839
alphabet there's a receiver and Sandra

356
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,360
and in the alphabet that they share and

357
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,699
then Chris said this reference frame is

358
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,760
a physical thing like neurons or hands

359
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,820
or mouth and then I got lost because you

360
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,360
know if uh when I encode I modify

361
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,360
something in the on the hard drive then

362
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,740
the physical components of the hard

363
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,980
drive is the reference uh frame but

364
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,779
you know this is not the shared language

365
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,760
then you know so

366
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,560
that's my first question maybe I'll stop

367
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,019
here to to Really I understand we're

368
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,760
dealing in metaphors but I want to

369
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,560
understand that you know the reference

370
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,019
frame up or down if Bob and Alice

371
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,480
understand it similarly then is that

372
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,180
really physical I think

373
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,380
answer is that

374
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,000
increase would you give a better answer

375
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,720
start from beginning

376
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,880
is that both are

377
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,740
true at the same time I think Chris

378
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,980
would give you a better answer but

379
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,839
the

380
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,240
the semantics or the sorry the Sherling

381
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,339
which reference frame has to have a

382
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,839
physical embodiment

383
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,779
and and that's uh Hardware a piece of

384
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,420
Hardware it's it's a neuron or something

385
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,600
um in this case it's the your free

386
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,480
choice of the spin axis

387
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,459
and that that's your reference frame but

388
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,800
at the same time it's it's a physical

389
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,660
it's a physical piece of Hardware so

390
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,120
reference frames are both

391
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,800
a piece of Hardware but also a piece of

392
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,279
semantics

393
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,540
so if I take it from the language I

394
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,740
don't quite understand to computer

395
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,259
science so if Alice and Bob communicate

396
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,060
through a piece of memory whether it's

397
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,800
random access memory hard drive then

398
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,079
endless encode something on that hard

399
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,760
drive and Bob reads from the hard drive

400
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,400
so in that sense they understand how to

401
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,439
encode and decode but they use the same

402
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,880
physical piece that's the reference

403
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,339
frame would that be correct

404
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:18,359
I might just add one again

405
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,059
continuing with the computer science

406
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,579
let's just and and the Shannon alphabet

407
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,919
let's just say that these are plain text

408
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,020
character encodings

409
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,679
and so they share the same set of

410
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,220
character a through z encodings

411
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,100
that that is reflected somewhere

412
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,200
physically

413
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,220
and so if um if a message was if if a

414
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,720
message were sent

415
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,320
um from another letter it wouldn't

416
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,380
render properly it's like outside uh

417
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,600
they couldn't differentiate

418
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,780
um Omega from Zeta because they only

419
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,960
have the A through Z software pack

420
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,799
and so there's an informational

421
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:07,799
distinguishment that's facilitated by

422
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,460
the information that's classically

423
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,940
inscribed on the screen the memory

424
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,200
and there is is an embodied physical as

425
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,559
well as a semantic aspect

426
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,879
to that situation

427
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,980
all right I think I'm getting closer to

428
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,960
understanding so to move away from

429
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,700
computer science if Ellis is a painter

430
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,919
she took a brush dipped it in red paint

431
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,980
and painted on the canvas red and Bob

432
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,440
has the same understanding of red as

433
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,120
Ellis and then he looked at the canvas

434
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,000
in red red that it is both the physical

435
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,039
you know a mark on the canvas and and

436
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,520
the symbol of red right

437
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,640
yes and if if somebody had red green

438
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,000
color blindness the physical apparatus

439
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,940
was not able to to informationally

440
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,700
distinguish then right they they

441
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,340
couldn't make this Wick rotation into

442
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,320
the quantum cognitive space they

443
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,380
wouldn't be able to to um detect that

444
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,240
there was a red figure painted on a

445
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
green background

446
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,980
yeah okay

447
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,140
the key component here is that the the

448
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,940
reference frame is inside of the agent

449
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,280
it's you know if you're a color blind

450
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,860
there is something physical inside of

451
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,679
your head or your eyes or whatever

452
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,840
that does not allow you to see the

453
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,039
difference

454
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,840
so

455
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,640
so your semantics are affected

456
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,260
ultimately by

457
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,919
a physical piece of Hardware

458
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,200
well yeah maybe I used a bad example

459
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,760
because color actually is computed in

460
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,559
the brain and color blindness is not

461
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,440
necessarily physical so uh okay but I I

462
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,720
think I get it closer but you know if we

463
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,660
if I may ask another question I get lost

464
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,400
with a saying that preparation and

465
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,140
measurement are

466
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,480
they have to happen both and that when

467
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,100
you prepare when you read you modify so

468
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,080
I am okay with the act of writing the

469
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,299
act of encoding so when I encode

470
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,299
something such as I you know Mark red on

471
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,340
the canvas or I write to the hard drive

472
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,760
a I modify the hard drive that is true

473
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,660
but if I if I am asking a question right

474
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,360
I'm not modifying anything on the canvas

475
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,120
so in what way the act of asking the

476
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,340
question or Preparation is modifying the

477
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,980
qubit this is where I'm lost you know if

478
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,919
I does that make sense yeah I think this

479
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,720
is exactly a question I asked to

480
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,080
Christian in the Stream So

481
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,940
I can't quite remember his answer but I

482
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,960
think it was basically that they're

483
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,240
completely dual pictures

484
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,600
um in the sense of you know they're

485
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,700
they're both two ways of looking at the

486
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,520
same thing uh it was kind of like you

487
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,260
know evolving time

488
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,080
towards the future or or the past if you

489
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,240
have time symmetry you know you can you

490
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,860
can divide

491
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,620
um yeah so I I myself am slightly

492
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,600
confused by the very

493
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,940
but I think the answer is that they are

494
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,340
painting at the same

495
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,360
picture of or am I preparing are just

496
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,960
completely do okay that's I think well

497
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,700
do you remember that Daniel

498
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,980
yeah okay I'll give a different angle

499
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,679
than the um the formal Duality

500
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,980
relationship so let's think about our

501
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,679
measuring device is going to be a carpet

502
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,360
and we're interested in whether somebody

503
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,659
has walked on the carpet so to prepare

504
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,460
the carpet we comb it very nicely in One

505
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,280
Direction and I'm sure there's analogies

506
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,640
there with the um preparation of qubits

507
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,799
in a quantum computer but we're going to

508
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,539
comb the carpet

509
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:57,960
as an act of preparation

510
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,940
and then

511
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,919
something is going to happen maybe it's

512
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,320
a split second later and so we're very

513
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,360
confident that it should be still nicely

514
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,059
combed or maybe it's going to be a whole

515
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,860
working day later

516
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,080
but now we're going to take that probe

517
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,559
the tip whatever it may be and we're

518
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,960
going to run it along the carpet

519
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,440
and we're going to measure the state of

520
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,720
of the direction of the fibers of the

521
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,760
carpet

522
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,919
so if we didn't prepare the measurements

523
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,380
we wouldn't have a calibrated reference

524
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,700
point

525
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,080
to know how things had even changed

526
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,380
and so there's there's a cycle of

527
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,539
preparing the apparatus through

528
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,419
something like a calibration or at least

529
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:51,179
like a emptying of memory

530
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:56,159
to be able to then make an observation

531
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,280
and to have that observation have the

532
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,539
kind of meaning that we would have

533
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,100
expected like

534
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,039
Purge the photo detector make the

535
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,780
measurement now you have to purge it

536
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,640
again that's the preparation what do you

537
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,380
think Alexi

538
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,720
that is a beautiful metaphor and I dig

539
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,820
that except I think I heard Chris say

540
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,360
that when you prepare you make Cube it

541
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,280
into up or down and this is when I'm

542
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,840
lost because when you comb the carpet

543
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,940
you don't do that you don't put the

544
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,799
footstep on it in fact there may not be

545
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,559
any footstep right and this is this is

546
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,940
where I'm missing you know I think in

547
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,740
quantum physics as well if you measure

548
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,059
there's the cause and effect

549
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,340
relationships are broken here for me you

550
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,380
know if in my Act of preparation I'm

551
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,840
opening my canvas to to read the message

552
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,640
but I do not know what the message will

553
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,400
be I'm game but if he's saying that when

554
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
I prepare I modify the carpet such that

555
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,919
it becomes either up or down actually

556
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,700
not blank but up or down then I'm lost

557
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,700
you have to comb the carpet up or down

558
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,419
there's no blank carpet so you you um

559
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,700
you know you have a slate you have an

560
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,740
Etch A Sketch you could either make all

561
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,780
the pixels white and then you'd be able

562
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,000
to measure a message in the dark or you

563
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,280
can make all the message dark or the

564
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,140
Slate dark and then you could be able to

565
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,780
measure something that was light but you

566
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,020
pick a direction of polarization in your

567
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,140
preparation or calibration step so that

568
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,260
deviations from that can be the

569
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,860
measurements

570
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,260
so you're saying carpet is binary carpet

571
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,880
doesn't have multiple States carpet can

572
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,919
only have two states so if I prepare it

573
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,620
I effectively put it in one of those

574
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,580
States

575
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,220
well if they do anything yeah let's say

576
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,380
we had the carpet at a um 45 degree

577
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,080
angle mathematically we could describe

578
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,059
that as a mixed state

579
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:51,960
and it may not be the most effective

580
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,659
for measuring the movement of people

581
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,539
across the carpet but yeah you could

582
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,919
um Define it

583
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,539
um or comb it that way it doesn't

584
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:03,720
necessarily if it were only a binary it

585
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,000
wouldn't be a qubit then it would be a

586
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,620
classical bit

587
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,879
I actually

588
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,059
yeah with the with you know I I

589
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,700
you know recall lecture a couple of

590
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,000
slides more shoots

591
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,039
we briefly talked about it like 10

592
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,360
minutes ago

593
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,960
by preparing you are choosing an axis

594
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,000
and whatever you

595
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,340
up or down in that axis now that doesn't

596
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,140
mean that the environment gets to do its

597
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,100
own thing right

598
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:43,140
uh and he

599
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,860
superposition of uh outcomes but at

600
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,200
least you're measuring that axis

601
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,360
right so it's going to be either up or

602
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,799
down in that act

603
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,740
you can call it two pictures and

604
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,260
I have uh I just want to see a few words

605
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,700
on

606
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,620
graphic screens and Define my diagrams

607
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,720
and maybe

608
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,700
clarify question a little more

609
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,039
Dean

610
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,720
on this really really interesting I I

611
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,960
don't know how metaphorically you could

612
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,080
explain the carpet as a wave

613
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,200
but I think once you get away from the

614
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,659
it's up or down

615
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:30,840
that possibility enters the conversation

616
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,779
and the only reason I I

617
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,539
wonder whether or not metaphorically the

618
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,760
wave aspect of that can be included in

619
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,299
how you're describing the carpet is that

620
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,760
Chris spent quite a bit of time on the

621
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,240
all possible paths argument and in

622
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,940
particular and I love this when Alice

623
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,940
isn't looking

624
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,500
right well in that in that wave equation

625
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,600
how could Alice not be looking

626
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,419
that's what gets real I mean Alice could

627
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,580
not be looking if it's if it's binary if

628
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,039
it's or up or down

629
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,559
but if it's wave

630
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,960
it's on a it's on a

631
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,600
it's a unitary propagator I'm not sure

632
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,620
how

633
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,919
she takes her eyes off of this

634
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,919
preparation measure

635
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,520
thing that's going off all the time so

636
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,320
this is

637
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,539
this is actually an what I consider to

638
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,460
be a feature or an opportunity or an

639
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,100
opening in the sense that from a

640
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,039
strictly information transfer piece not

641
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,840
a mechanical piece now not a physical

642
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,640
thing

643
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,919
from an information transfer piece maybe

644
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,860
the carpet can be metaphorically

645
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,860
understood as a wave

646
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,840
that the eyes

647
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,820
of Alice or whoever's doing the

648
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,919
preparing and the measuring Bob Alice I

649
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,679
don't care peaches

650
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,600
that there is actually a difference then

651
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,720
between something that is exchanged

652
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,059
and something that is informationally

653
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,860
transferred

654
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,779
and again I don't think that the four of

655
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,460
us here sitting right now are going to

656
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,140
resolve that

657
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,000
but I wonder

658
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,580
If part of our

659
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,000
part of the difficulty in this is

660
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,820
finding the physical metaphor

661
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,460
that explains the

662
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,279
theoretical transfer in such a way that

663
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,539
it doesn't

664
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:37,200
it it breaks the Symmetry and

665
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,360
holds it because again we're back to

666
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,700
gripper and grip we're back to figuring

667
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,820
it out and Outing the physical figures

668
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,760
in the state that we're in and we have

669
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,940
to do both at once so

670
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,340
again Daniel you're you're the creative

671
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,679
guy how do you turn your carpet metaphor

672
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,740
into a wave equation

673
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,520
maybe there's a subwoofer in the room or

674
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,900
maybe somebody is um waving the carpet

675
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,480
but what what you what you said about

676
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,120
the um what is exchanged and what is

677
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,220
transferred

678
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,080
um maybe the transfer is the classical

679
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,880
component

680
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,980
uh um oh I I don't know which one will

681
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,539
be exchange or transfer but one of them

682
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,840
is the classical inscription that's how

683
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,600
many gigabytes were written or read to

684
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,760
the hard drive but what's exchanged

685
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,820
let's just say are the the semantics of

686
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,020
meaning

687
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,640
and given an appropriate co-preparation

688
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,640
maybe only one bit needs to be

689
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,960
transferred

690
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,620
for the exchange of a message that was

691
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,860
already triggered to be set off and then

692
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,980
also this entire discussion it it kind

693
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,520
of strikes me as like the uh

694
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,600
Cartesian duality of our time but rather

695
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,559
than mind and body it's the physicality

696
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,960
of information syntax

697
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,539
and the metaphysicality of information

698
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,399
semantics

699
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,240
and that's these kind of Two Worlds with

700
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,120
their own physics and metaphysics

701
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,120
that we're trying to connect

702
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,460
and it's like

703
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,740
similarly well is the information how

704
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,299
does the information world cause

705
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,220
something physical

706
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,200
how does the physical cause something

707
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,539
informational and I think that the

708
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:39,360
entire Journey that the course and

709
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,179
everyone is on is uh physics as

710
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:45,779
information processing that those as a

711
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,659
qualified and distinguished but minimum

712
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,140
of two set Alexi

713
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,419
yeah thank you so much uh can you hear

714
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,860
me yeah

715
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,559
I I I'm yeah Thinking Out Loud maybe but

716
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,600
I I think the way to get closer to

717
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,000
understanding in my head is to let go of

718
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,980
the metaphor of asking a question right

719
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,659
so if Alexis is talking to Daniel

720
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,179
through zoom and I pose even a closed

721
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:10,740
question up or down

722
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,340
so I you know uh formulated the question

723
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,559
and you know uh released it into Zoom

724
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,899
space and then I'm silent and I opened

725
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,120
my listening to your answer but you

726
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,240
Daniel have agency to stay up or down I

727
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,640
did not I do not have any effect on

728
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,559
whether you will say up or down right

729
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,020
and that's the difference so me asking

730
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,080
you a question does not modify uh the

731
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,419
answer you you decide Ellis talking to

732
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:38,580
Bob Bob has the agency to answer the

733
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,000
question not Alice and that that's where

734
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,860
I'm stuck so I don't know if asking a

735
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,600
question continues to be a good metaphor

736
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,940
preparing preparing the instrument for

737
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,820
measurement is is maybe better and and

738
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,220
so but but actually Alice is not asking

739
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,860
Bob Ellis is acting on a qubit

740
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,220
right and qubit is is a simple thing

741
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,380
that you know can can literally

742
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,679
physically be up or down I guess and so

743
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,480
that's that's maybe maybe that's the

744
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,399
answer that Ellis does not ask involved

745
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,399
Ellis does something to the qubit

746
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,159
and because qubit can be up or down then

747
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,600
that's no longer asking a question

748
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,640
asking a question implies your your

749
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,919
correspondent can can can tell you

750
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,159
anything

751
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,980
when we're dealing with the very

752
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,440
sophisticated process of natural

753
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,020
language question asking I think we're

754
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,640
dealing we're dealing with something

755
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,620
that that's orders

756
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,640
um of composition above the Kinder the

757
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,700
kind of binary ask so I I agree with

758
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,779
that

759
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,360
um it's almost like

760
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,539
um Alice prepares the photoreceptor so

761
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:51,240
it's slate is refreshed

762
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,820
and then it's the photon or the light

763
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,039
emitting object that has the agency to

764
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,039
send the photon or not I mean maybe the

765
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,460
measure the preparation occurs

766
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,980
and then no one comes back to check

767
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,460
whether or not agency was even exerted

768
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,740
and I think when we really focus on like

769
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,559
the Nano probe like Atomic Force

770
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,460
microscopy really tracing with a super

771
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,980
fine tip over the surface of something

772
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,380
or scattering x-rays when we really

773
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,080
think about the the

774
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,059
um moment

775
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:30,360
of information transfer we've realized

776
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,260
like

777
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,779
nothing comes for free and I think that

778
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,460
this question asking framework other

779
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,380
than really conveniently reads arrive in

780
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,480
quantum mechanics in one hour incredibly

781
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,899
helps us understand that we don't get to

782
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,480
ask it for free in terms of time we

783
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,340
don't get to ask it for free in terms of

784
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,279
energy and we don't get to ask free

785
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,220
floating questions with a question and

786
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,039
or agentic responder

787
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:59,039
are not involved already in a semantics

788
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,059
so I think it's calling attention to

789
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,899
um the components of an experiment or a

790
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:09,960
question or an opening

791
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,659
but agree that it's not always as simple

792
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,540
as a binary question but in the special

793
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,020
simple bazel case

794
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,060
it does

795
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,960
start there

796
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,520
you want to look at any of the um the

797
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,460
participant submitted questions if there

798
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,320
was any that struck your face let me

799
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,540
finish real quick I have like yeah maybe

800
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,480
five minutes to wrap this up uh so and

801
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,639
and this I think is going to at least in

802
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,520
part answer one of Dean's concerns so

803
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,980
the next thing we should uh very briefly

804
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,659
cover so let's talk a little bit about

805
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:52,980
you know holographic screens and also

806
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,859
uh this is the paper on the physical

807
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,780
media photographic principle so let's

808
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,300
take a look at also this picture

809
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,160
from that paper

810
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,560
this is the holographic boundary and you

811
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,580
know

812
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,800
nine hours principle and all these

813
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,240
thermodynamic constraints on information

814
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,020
processing

815
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,060
necessitate uh the breakdown of this

816
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,680
boundary in terms of you know free

817
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,619
energy extraction sectors memory sectors

818
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,740
and so on and by the way if you if you

819
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,020
read um the paragraphs around this

820
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,359
picture there's more details on how the

821
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,180
time qrf is is induced but we'll leave

822
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,440
that as it is for now uh

823
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,599
Dean what I meant by this answering your

824
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,180
your concern your concern was that you

825
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,099
don't see how Alice can take off her

826
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:44,820
eyes from the picture yeah uh but that's

827
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,440
precisely what's going on here right

828
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,880
there's there's a sector that's being

829
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,560
observed which is a subset of these

830
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,579
keywords

831
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:53,460
that are being observed but presumably

832
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,060
she has the freedom to you know say hey

833
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,460
this sector now I I declare as my

834
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,500
observation sector please I declare as

835
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,079
my memory sector this I declare us at my

836
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,720
through my uh free energy extraction

837
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,040
sector

838
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,920
so it is because of this fundamental

839
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,260
limits

840
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,880
on the amount of information processing

841
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,920
it is not true that she can she doesn't

842
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,820
have a an unidealized you know

843
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,060
you know laplacian if you wish

844
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,040
um access to all the degrees of freedom

845
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,700
she can only observe finally

846
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,760
uh a final amount of stuff so so she she

847
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,859
is forced to take her eyes off at least

848
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,900
part of the system at least for a while

849
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,000
right because otherwise you know all

850
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,160
this energy and time constraints that

851
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,320
Daniel was just mentioning you know

852
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,780
they're not we you have to abide by

853
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,280
those

854
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,200
so

855
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,300
um so a few things that Chris mentioned

856
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,640
in the last lecture when it came to this

857
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,240
holographic screen is well number one uh

858
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,880
we've got all the information exchange

859
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,420
is mediated by bits

860
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,140
uh here at the qubit at this holographic

861
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,880
screen

862
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,780
this in turn enforces

863
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,760
um a finiteness in the information

864
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,619
transfer if you wish there is not

865
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:18,960
infinitely uh an infinite amount of

866
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,820
information in finite space even if you

867
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,859
were to pack it at planckian density

868
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,260
which is presumably the limit that black

869
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,660
holes achieve it's still a finite amount

870
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,640
of information in a finite amount of

871
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,359
so if you have Finance you are taking

872
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,260
uh the other

873
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,300
is the following

874
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,599
um and again uh Chris will deal with

875
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,000
this at greater detail in perhaps

876
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,640
lecture five I think maybe four but it's

877
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,220
the notion of emergence base time which

878
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,140
is that a and b separately so you think

879
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,359
of you know these are presumably the

880
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:01,920
internal degrees of freedom what's going

881
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,440
on inside of a Alice at an abstract

882
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,040
level there may not be a notion of the

883
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,540
space

884
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,400
but you know

885
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,640
notion of space emerges at the boundary

886
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,119
and uh that's uh not easy to explain I

887
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,140
think

888
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,180
presumably has to do with

889
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,820
and stuff like

890
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,619
um and I don't know the full details

891
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,680
myself but but for now that's that's one

892
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,119
of the key things that that Chris

893
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,700
mentioned which is that an agent you

894
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,920
know may not have

895
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,760
a space but he may emerge honorary

896
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,140
okay

897
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,599
and

898
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:45,660
the last thing and I'm glad that to see

899
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,060
that this was mentioned already so it

900
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,320
saves us time I don't have to say it

901
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,540
again take us a minute

902
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,980
this

903
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,099
five months at least you can answer if

904
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,720
you're can you just turn off your video

905
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,660
under just so you don't have lag

906
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,279
yeah one second

907
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,618
yes

908
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,400
this notion of uh refinement diagrams

909
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,180
right

910
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,560
so

911
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,900
what is this whole thing about unitary

912
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,320
Evolution or preparation

913
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,599
the the scattering picture as Alice

914
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,099
preparing at the director of her

915
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,320
boundary right and writing it into her

916
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,240
memory

917
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,280
and then

918
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,220
measuring it at some point in future

919
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,160
right requires that you consider the

920
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,380
possible that happened to that

921
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,320
preparation okay so if there's

922
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,380
some amount of time passes

923
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,960
you're prepared you know your data time

924
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,119
T you look at it again at time t plus DT

925
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,579
you have to take into account all the

926
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:56,940
possible histories

927
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,400
it's just saying I prepared it here now

928
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,619
it's up to B what happens until the next

929
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,540
time I look at it

930
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,540
up to the environment so I I have to in

931
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,880
in that unitary Evolution I consider all

932
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,160
the possibilities right and that's

933
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,140
that's exactly you know the requirement

934
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:26,000
so let's just look at the computer

935
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,760
leave it there for now no we can open up

936
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,320
the discussion

937
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,800
so there's two things that are now where

938
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,320
was this yeah

939
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,820
yes

940
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,720
so uh-huh go ahead yeah so all I was

941
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,180
I'll I understand or I think I

942
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,220
understand

943
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,380
I think I understand that if I'm looking

944
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,619
at on or if I'm attending to on

945
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,599
I'm not looking it off

946
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,839
what what I saw in that wave thing with

947
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,079
vitamin was I could also be

948
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,900
looking at the switch

949
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,079
where the two different places of on and

950
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:10,020
off exist and when I'm looking at the

951
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,020
entire switch I'm not looking at one or

952
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,599
the other I'm looking at the

953
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,200
at that basal as Daniel described that

954
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,460
basal opportunity of both and and I

955
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,920
think that on that I don't know how that

956
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,680
ties in with reference frames but on

957
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,480
that level that says

958
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,220
I'm now

959
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,619
looking at all possible

960
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:36,960
in that moment I don't think at least

961
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,940
from that perspective that reference

962
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,700
frame I'm zooming into a on or off

963
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,040
binary Choice decision Branch I'm I'm

964
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,500
still at that place where the

965
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,920
preparation allows for for both I'm not

966
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,300
I'm literally not taking my eyes off at

967
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,760
that place so again I'm not arguing with

968
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,520
you because I what you describe and then

969
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,099
and the image that you brought up

970
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:07,320
all that is is bringing it down to a

971
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,480
granular level and saying if I'm paying

972
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,339
attention to this I can't be paying

973
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:13,800
attention to that but if I

974
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,660
physically

975
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,440
from a transfer perspective back up so

976
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,780
that I can see both both possibilities

977
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,480
at once I don't know that I'm taking my

978
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,060
eye off of either that's that's the only

979
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,339
thing that I was bringing up now of

980
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,680
course Chris will probably hear this and

981
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,000
go

982
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,859
Dean you got to go and rethink this

983
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:36,000
whole thing through which is great

984
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,280
because I'm here to learn but that's

985
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,260
again if I if I miss

986
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,540
if I miss

987
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,200
spoke about what I was trying to say it

988
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,940
wasn't because I

989
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,940
I don't see those moments when

990
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,599
I'm I'm directing my my preparation over

991
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,579
here and that's going to give me one

992
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:59,099
kind of measurement versus if I'm taking

993
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:00,200
in

994
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,500
a larger time frame and now or larger

995
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,900
spatial frame or larger holographic

996
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,280
screen like I don't even know how to

997
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,380
describe it because I just don't have

998
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,540
the words for it yet but

999
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,160
there you go I just want to be clear

1000
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,500
that I'm not I don't think I'm confused

1001
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,380
I just want to know the difference

1002
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,720
between when I'm looking at on or off

1003
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,420
and when I'm looking at the entire

1004
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,660
switch that's all

1005
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:32,099
I'll add one point on this slide

1006
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,380
it goes back to some of the earliest

1007
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,560
points that Chris made about the

1008
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,040
ontological Primacy of communication

1009
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,619
space and time arise from communicating

1010
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:45,000
agents

1011
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,040
communicating agents are not something

1012
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,160
that we have to squeeze into an a priori

1013
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,200
spatial Temple framework

1014
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,839
so quantum mechanics saying here on the

1015
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:57,060
slide is about measurement not

1016
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,740
mechanical motion

1017
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,960
so we don't need to wait around or

1018
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,079
speculate as to how from the quote

1019
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,140
mechanical or physical hard drive

1020
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,140
measurement arises or happens

1021
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,040
we start with the measurements occurring

1022
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,440
and then different kinds of

1023
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,500
sophisticated agents can conceptualize

1024
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,480
of movements through spaces and times

1025
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,579
and this also relates to Bayesian

1026
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:29,839
mechanics as a mechanics and a physics

1027
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,940
of movement on information geometric

1028
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,680
spaces

1029
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,780
and so

1030
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,839
the physics can be projected by

1031
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,319
appropriately prepared agents but we

1032
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:46,500
don't necessarily need to wonder about

1033
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,020
how that agent fits within a mechanical

1034
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,260
setting and I guess this is where humans

1035
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,280
are

1036
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,520
with the I am a strange Loop girdle

1037
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,540
Escher Bach gripper and gripped mystery

1038
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:06,619
of being able to to see it multiple ways

1039
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,040
Audrey do you want to go to the um

1040
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,480
questions

1041
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,480
yeah let me just say using remarks here

1042
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,920
I think what Chris is uh

1043
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,900
punch in line

1044
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,960
of the paper uh free energy principle

1045
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,760
for Quantum systems

1046
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,339
which is you know morally speaking it's

1047
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:35,640
similar to relative relaxation to

1048
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,140
thermodynamical equilibrium which is

1049
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,119
that if you have an isolated bipartite

1050
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,560
Quantum system A and B are gonna turn

1051
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,540
um are going to tend towards reference

1052
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,960
Frame Alignment under for entanglement

1053
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,079
and this these two things are

1054
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,400
are basically very intimately related by

1055
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,960
aligning the reference frames you'll get

1056
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,099
a and b

1057
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:00,660
will be driven towards maximal

1058
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,200
entanglement

1059
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,000
so uh should I

1060
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,940
uh take a look at the questions and

1061
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,079
okay

1062
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,900
open this yeah

1063
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,200
so so uh

1064
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,000
if you guys have access to the Q a

1065
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,359
ah there's been many more questions in

1066
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:25,500
the last

1067
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,720
you know bringing you guys attention to

1068
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,839
a few of them uh this is where

1069
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:32,400
um

1070
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,640
Chris links uh to the papers of rubelli

1071
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,220
which I mentioned earlier in passing

1072
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,480
when we were talking about the

1073
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,579
preparation measurement cycle and the

1074
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:46,319
notion of thermal time or uh you know

1075
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,240
subjective time if you wish

1076
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,599
somebody Brew out this remark that you

1077
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,280
know performing some calculations here

1078
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,200
you can relate

1079
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,940
T time to a change in

1080
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,260
um

1081
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,460
okay

1082
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,520
a change in the volume of phase space or

1083
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,859
you know more precisely the the amount

1084
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:10,500
of available states in the state space

1085
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,819
you know with a log and whatever uh with

1086
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:17,220
respect to the energy right

1087
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,220
and you know

1088
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:24,960
so so this you know restates the

1089
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,220
the idea that we're talking about

1090
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,380
earlier right like your intrinsic uh

1091
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,339
subjective time being

1092
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:37,500
basically speaking that is uh Observer

1093
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,540
dependent

1094
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,180
so that's a a good question to

1095
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,379
uh take a look at

1096
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,839
um

1097
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,040
there's another one what is what is

1098
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,079
meant by local free of choice

1099
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,060
uh this is a very good answer too local

1100
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,660
here means that some boundary right

1101
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:02,040
isolated uh systems are idealized by you

1102
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,020
know definition there's always going to

1103
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,060
be an observer interacting with an

1104
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,220
environment so a nice purely isolated

1105
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,800
system is an idealization so a local

1106
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,380
free choice means here is exactly what

1107
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,599
we said earlier right that you get to

1108
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,060
choose the spin access at the boundary

1109
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,060
qubits

1110
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,200
um

1111
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,040
I mean there were some nice questions

1112
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,900
relating

1113
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,180
Mark of blankets to the scattering

1114
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,700
picture

1115
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,440
uh so this one for instance it's also

1116
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,920
worth a look

1117
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,240
so somebody you know brought up this you

1118
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,960
know

1119
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,700
very good point about

1120
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,980
the scattering Matrix the scattering

1121
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,900
Matrix is by the way

1122
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,640
you know let's not think about it

1123
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,920
mathematically just uh

1124
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,900
let's think about the picture right you

1125
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,819
you imagine two particles that are

1126
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:58,200
interacting

1127
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,640
far away

1128
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,740
they are free right they are specially

1129
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,040
separated on interacting free particles

1130
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,720
yeah and somehow at some point they come

1131
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,060
to interact right and then you have to

1132
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,220
write all the final diagrams for all the

1133
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,859
exchange of bosons or whatever the

1134
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:17,460
interaction is and and that's how you

1135
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,380
would compute the amplitudes for the

1136
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,480
scattering process right how those two

1137
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,160
particles that were

1138
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,500
you know separated came to interact

1139
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,220
and then they go off to Infinity again

1140
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:32,220
uh Chris here brings up the point that

1141
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,740
in a sense how you define a mark of

1142
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,579
blanket is you know in the opposite

1143
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:39,780
direction right

1144
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,599
you see micro blanket in at least in the

1145
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,460
graph Theory sense you start with a node

1146
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,160
and micro blanket is just the set of

1147
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,619
nodes that

1148
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,000
separate

1149
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,859
in terms of conditional probability that

1150
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:54,839
node from everyone else right and then

1151
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:57,119
you can have edges which are going to be

1152
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,260
directly uh causal networks so as you

1153
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,380
click no no Cycles directed edges that's

1154
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,140
that's how the graph looks

1155
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,079
and you you build up so essentially

1156
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,819
you're taking the opposite

1157
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:13,800
um picture right you start with a node

1158
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,119
which in this case would be the

1159
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,560
interaction and then you build up to

1160
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,700
Infinity

1161
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,619
as opposed to in the scattering picture

1162
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:21,599
which is like you start with

1163
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,140
particles non-interacting at Infinity

1164
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,339
let me see how they go off to Infinity

1165
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:29,460
again and then the interaction is is in

1166
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,440
the middle

1167
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,900
uh So that obviously the answer is is a

1168
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,480
bit more uh precise but it's it's worth

1169
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,599
taking a look at

1170
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:40,319
and

1171
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,440
this is it an interesting one too

1172
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,839
of a symmetrical input output y

1173
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,460
bandwidth so again if you think of it as

1174
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,460
a graph nothing is constraining you to

1175
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,440
say that you're going to have more

1176
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,839
incoming errors than outcoming errors

1177
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:56,940
into the boundary right

1178
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,740
that that's just the way it is you know

1179
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,960
if you think of it a graph there is no

1180
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,740
symmetry imposed the only natural sense

1181
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,720
of symmetry would be energy conservation

1182
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,579
and that's exactly what you know Chris

1183
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:12,059
says here right which is that

1184
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:14,119
um

1185
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,400
and I'm not sure myself how you relate

1186
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,420
it to

1187
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,180
a conservation of not quite information

1188
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,619
but you know

1189
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:25,380
I I wouldn't know how to fix it myself I

1190
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,119
would just take a look at the question

1191
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,640
but basically you know there's a

1192
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,880
priority nothing that necessitates

1193
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,740
symmetry in input output in Market

1194
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,119
blankets

1195
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:38,160
but if you are to talk about any sort of

1196
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,960
symmetry the natural language would not

1197
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,640
be in terms of incoming versus outcome

1198
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,140
in errors but rather

1199
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:47,220
energy conservation which we we saw is

1200
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,740
is you know a closed cost enough

1201
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,319
information transfer right because of

1202
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,079
the minimal requirements for Action to

1203
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:57,599
rewrite a qubit

1204
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,140
and the last question that I would like

1205
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,119
to bring your you guys's attention to I

1206
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,160
mean all of them are great

1207
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,619
uh but we have finite resources and

1208
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:08,780
finite times

1209
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,780
on internet uh

1210
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,740
would be

1211
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,099
would be uh this one okay and I'm not

1212
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:22,500
gonna go into too much detail

1213
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,160
but this is again about

1214
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,540
the local

1215
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,980
wait no one second

1216
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:41,180
um

1217
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,040
so turn on my camera by the way Daniel

1218
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,819
go for it

1219
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:52,559
and also people people can see all the

1220
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,619
questions on the website

1221
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:58,079
right and submit their own as well

1222
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,300
yes for sure

1223
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,940
uh so and now I lost track of the

1224
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,240
question that I wanted to show you guys

1225
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,880
I think it's this one over here yes uh

1226
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,400
yes exactly this one so by the way all

1227
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,020
of them are good even this one the

1228
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,520
holographic principle doesn't make it

1229
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,440
easier to compute any physics problems

1230
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,180
well

1231
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,800
please take a look at Chris's answer but

1232
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,680
all I can say is that this ideas of

1233
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,140
holography I'm not an expert I'm not a

1234
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,940
condensed matter physicist but they're

1235
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,740
they're used all over physics nowadays

1236
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,980
not necessarily just in high energy uh I

1237
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,780
know that condensed matter theorists use

1238
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,819
them all the time so the answer to this

1239
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:38,400
is an emphatic yes

1240
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,940
the holographic at least adhcft is used

1241
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,339
all over but again I'm not a physicist

1242
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:45,900
myself

1243
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:46,559
um

1244
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,420
so this is the last question I want to

1245
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,079
do

1246
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,839
bring your attention to

1247
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:55,740
and uh here Chris uh this this may be

1248
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,140
the one worth taking a look at in terms

1249
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,900
of uh in order to answer

1250
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,180
all uh

1251
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,059
you know the earlier speculations that

1252
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:07,500
we had about time

1253
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,400
internal clock here somebody asks about

1254
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,400
um

1255
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,119
synchrony

1256
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,119
and

1257
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,760
you know just the perception of time

1258
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,280
with respect to external clocks I

1259
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,359
suppose

1260
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:27,420
increase here answers that

1261
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,520
at the end of the day any even if you're

1262
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,920
using an external clock

1263
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,920
everything that you perceive outside at

1264
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,900
the end of the day has to be in terms of

1265
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,880
an internal clock any information

1266
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,059
incoming you're gonna have to you know

1267
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:43,920
make causal sense of it you're gonna

1268
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,319
have to write it into a memory in terms

1269
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,200
of an internal clock so

1270
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,059
so you're never going to be able to eat

1271
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:51,960
this

1272
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,180
so to speak increase your position of

1273
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,119
the passage of time by taking an

1274
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,859
external clock even if you think it's

1275
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:00,180
more precise than anything you have

1276
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,980
inside I think that's basically what his

1277
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,020
answer amounts to and this is morally

1278
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,020
related to you know all this Frame

1279
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:12,020
halting problem stuff where because

1280
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,880
I'm never as a system you're never going

1281
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,000
to give an infinitely precise you know

1282
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,099
I'm speaking very Loosely here an

1283
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:21,480
infinitely precise description or

1284
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,599
yourself you're you're never gonna

1285
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,520
morally speaking again that's that's

1286
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,200
what it amounts to you're never going to

1287
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,339
be able to

1288
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:32,760
outdo your internal clock by

1289
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,280
by trying to leverage something external

1290
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,200
like like you know an atomic clock that

1291
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,420
even if you think it's more precise at

1292
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,680
the end of the day

1293
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,440
your own subjective

1294
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,480
uh perception of information will depend

1295
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,319
on internal clocks

1296
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:56,099
so we can uh open up things and conclude

1297
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:57,540
in remarks and

1298
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,720
any other Alexi or Dean or anyone else

1299
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,520
who may have joined

1300
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,500
I don't have anything else to say at

1301
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,800
this point

1302
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,240
I mean where where or when are we we had

1303
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,400
Session One

1304
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,640
with a real big historical overview

1305
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:24,839
section two we focused on

1306
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,720
the measurability question

1307
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,540
which is answered with a question and we

1308
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,760
talked about some of the constraints

1309
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,720
of question asking namely that it takes

1310
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,000
time it takes energy you have to ask it

1311
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,280
to somebody or something on an interface

1312
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,559
and it has to have a semantic Quantum

1313
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:44,819
reference frame

1314
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,599
and this is

1315
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,040
dovetailing with a free energy principle

1316
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,440
of course because the free energy

1317
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,559
Principle as it says in the syllables to

1318
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:56,880
what does the free energy principle

1319
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,619
apply and Chris says everything

1320
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,000
measurable

1321
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,579
that's why it's a theory of every thing

1322
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:05,420
that we choose to measure model not

1323
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,339
ontological statements about what is

1324
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:12,300
and then where are we heading into in

1325
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,079
session three

1326
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,800
have you looked ahead under or do you

1327
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,200
want me to read what's in the syllabus

1328
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,380
uh please do yeah yeah I think basically

1329
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,800
uh my short answer to that and possibly

1330
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,359
my full answer also is that it's just

1331
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,059
going to take care of the loose hands in

1332
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:32,339
this lecture too so this lecture too is

1333
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:35,099
a warm up to the to the real thing which

1334
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:36,960
we need to talk more seriously about

1335
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,540
reference friends to to in order to get

1336
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,160
the precise

1337
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,920
a picture of this Quantum measurement

1338
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,460
process yeah yeah it says that session

1339
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,680
three will introduce the idea of quantum

1340
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,020
reference frames and the representation

1341
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,660
using hierarchies of binary classifiers

1342
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,819
these formal structures provide a

1343
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:58,200
semantics for measurement and hence

1344
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,180
provide the basis for a theory of

1345
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,640
meaning for interacting agents the

1346
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,980
language of qrfs allows a particularly

1347
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,839
straightforward and intuitive definition

1348
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,839
of variational free energy and so allows

1349
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,180
a fully General Quantum formulation of

1350
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,420
the fep we will see that the fpp is a

1351
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,980
classical limit on the principle of

1352
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,980
unitarity the fundamental principle of

1353
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,480
quantum theory

1354
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,000
okay

1355
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,660
uh by the way uh Daniel can I I'm not

1356
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:28,920
sure if you're busy but I just got an

1357
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,839
email from Chris I think he may be

1358
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:32,040
watching us

1359
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,780
and I think he's just confused about the

1360
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,839
link so Chris I don't know if you're

1361
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:38,640
there still but

1362
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,240
um

1363
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,859
do you think it's worth it can we send

1364
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:42,960
him the link real quick if you can come

1365
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,440
for a few yeah

1366
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,740
I'll I'll send Chris the um the zoom

1367
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,160
link now so yeah

1368
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,220
hold on to your qubit Chris we're coming

1369
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,459
yeah

1370
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:00,720
so let's let's give him a few minutes

1371
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,660
maybe he's still watching and he'll

1372
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,220
he'll answer the questions better than I

1373
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,619
could well well Daniel is sending him

1374
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:11,160
sending him a Lifeline can I

1375
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:15,839
just from the from the the rookie

1376
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,200
perspective on this

1377
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,599
Session One seemed like there was a big

1378
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:27,180
time window like the historical piece

1379
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,359
over using an external clock and a

1380
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:34,559
timeline this one felt like the parabola

1381
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,440
and the up or down and the entanglement

1382
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,700
was

1383
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,119
almost instantaneous in terms of that

1384
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:46,440
plank length that we were really holding

1385
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,160
up as comparative to that timeline that

1386
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,760
chronological timeline and so I'm

1387
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,940
guessing that now that we've established

1388
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:00,180
those two as different

1389
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,660
where does that go but again that's just

1390
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:07,578
the rookies view of things

1391
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:13,799
hey Chris welcome

1392
01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:15,900
yeah hi this is a very interesting

1393
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,880
discussion

1394
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:22,319
um and it it's uh given me some pointers

1395
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,440
as to what to emphasize

1396
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,079
at the beginning of session three

1397
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:31,799
uh but I I can say in response to Dean's

1398
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:33,319
question

1399
01:00:33,319 --> 01:00:37,200
that the time when Alice isn't looking

1400
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,880
is the time during which Bob is making

1401
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,680
his measurement and then his next

1402
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,619
preparation step

1403
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:49,260
so if you if you consider again that

1404
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:52,859
slide that shows uh

1405
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:55,260
sort of the Feynman representation of

1406
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,819
what's Happening

1407
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,900
as this unitary flow

1408
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,720
that's what Bob is doing and I think

1409
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,940
Andrew said that

1410
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:09,480
oh from Alice's point of view

1411
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,900
Bob is just some Quantum system and

1412
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,599
she's banged on that system by asking a

1413
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:16,640
question

1414
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,980
and now that system is doing something

1415
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:24,420
or other that she can't see until it it

1416
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:28,319
I.E Bob bangs on his side of the screen

1417
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:31,559
and she gets some information by making

1418
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:33,240
a measurement

1419
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,880
oh so

1420
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,940
she she may be not looking for a very

1421
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:41,099
short period of time

1422
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:45,660
oh right according to her internal clock

1423
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,240
she's not looking for just the time it

1424
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,700
takes for one of her internal ticks to

1425
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,760
take place

1426
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:57,660
but uh in in general

1427
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,299
oh we're not saying anything about how

1428
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:03,299
long that time is right if you think of

1429
01:02:03,299 --> 01:02:06,540
this in a scattering Theory way

1430
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,760
oh then we're talking about the time

1431
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,020
between two protons leaving the Rings

1432
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,059
on the uh

1433
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:17,579
Large Hadron Collider

1434
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:20,400
to the time that all the stuff that

1435
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,380
comes out of their Collision is measured

1436
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,940
by the detectors

1437
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:27,059
which is a nanosecond or something like

1438
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:31,579
that some very short period of time

1439
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:37,380
so just just think of that interval as

1440
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,520
the

1441
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:43,740
the measure of the intrinsic uh

1442
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,760
time dependence external time dependence

1443
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,799
of the interaction

1444
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,720
someone has to do something and then

1445
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,220
someone else has to do something and

1446
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,599
there's a gap

1447
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:58,200
between what the first person does and

1448
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,200
what they see in response

1449
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,260
oh let's see what's the other question

1450
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,020
uh the the other central question that

1451
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,339
came up today

1452
01:03:08,339 --> 01:03:12,000
was the question of why observing

1453
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,880
something requires action

1454
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,680
and of course in the in the classical

1455
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,420
picture observing something doesn't

1456
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,440
require any action at all

1457
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,839
the the event just happens

1458
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:28,140
and this is the the fundamental if you

1459
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,540
will distinction between classical and

1460
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,920
quantum theory

1461
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,460
is that making an observation in in

1462
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:39,180
quantitory is taking an action on the

1463
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,559
world

1464
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,920
and there's a lovely metaphor that's

1465
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,240
that's not

1466
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,640
correct in detail but it's it's very

1467
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,799
useful I think conceptually

1468
01:03:49,799 --> 01:03:52,859
uh which Heisenberg came up with to try

1469
01:03:52,859 --> 01:03:55,260
to explain his uncertainty principle too

1470
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,960
his classical colleagues

1471
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,680
they said look suppose I'm trying to to

1472
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,079
see a very small particle and measure

1473
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,760
its motion

1474
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,299
uh I have to have a microscope to see

1475
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:11,099
this particle

1476
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:14,460
and to measure its motion I need to to

1477
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,559
light it up and shine some light on it

1478
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,160
and those photons of light are actually

1479
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,700
impacting the thing I'm trying to see

1480
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,480
so the the act of observation itself

1481
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,599
requires banging something into an

1482
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:32,579
object uh

1483
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:36,480
and uh when we're just looking out at

1484
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,420
the world it's the sun that's banging

1485
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:42,780
the light into the object not us

1486
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,780
but we can we can sort of merge those

1487
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,880
two systems together because it's the

1488
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,920
sun that's taking the action

1489
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,160
that lets us get some information

1490
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,559
that the sun is perturbing the things

1491
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:58,200
that we're looking at by banging photons

1492
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,480
into them

1493
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,260
um

1494
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,299
and I think that that picture of of

1495
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:08,099
Heisenberg's is what uh he used to to

1496
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:10,260
actually derive the uncertainty

1497
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:14,040
principle in terms of momentum and uh

1498
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,920
position because banging something into

1499
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,020
something is transferring momentum to it

1500
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,420
photons transverse of momentum to the

1501
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,940
tiny particle in the microscope

1502
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:27,720
and that perturbs its position on the

1503
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,000
microscope stage which is precisely what

1504
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,220
Heisenberg is trying to measure so

1505
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:36,359
that's his his point in that analogy

1506
01:05:36,359 --> 01:05:40,140
observation itself always takes action

1507
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,619
and that's why observation and and

1508
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:45,059
preparation are duels and quantum theory

1509
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:47,400
because they each require a minimum one

1510
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,460
unit of action and I think Andrew you

1511
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:52,559
said the The Duality can be thought of

1512
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,900
in terms of time and variance and that's

1513
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,720
exactly correct

1514
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,920
preparations just measurement run

1515
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,099
backwards right and vice versa and if

1516
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:04,500
you let me say a few words I think this

1517
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,839
also answers my own confusion and the

1518
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:08,700
one that Alexi the question that Alexi

1519
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:09,839
post earlier

1520
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,299
which is this Duality between

1521
01:06:11,299 --> 01:06:14,460
preparation and measurement in your

1522
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,200
picture that you're bringing up Chris

1523
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,900
with a Heisenberg by

1524
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,319
shining photons on a particle that I'm

1525
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,539
trying to observe

1526
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:26,700
um these pictures of preparation and

1527
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,339
measurement are dual because in in doing

1528
01:06:29,339 --> 01:06:31,380
so I'm constraining the system in trying

1529
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,359
to measure it I'm constraining it so

1530
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,359
it's so in in me trying to gather

1531
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:39,660
information by shining photos on it what

1532
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,819
I'm really doing is I'm constraining it

1533
01:06:41,819 --> 01:06:43,380
I'm just saying

1534
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:46,500
you can only take this this you know

1535
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,079
momenta or or position is is would that

1536
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:50,700
be correct

1537
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,020
of

1538
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:54,420
yeah in fact your

1539
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,460
in the microscope example it's

1540
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,380
particularly clear you're you're

1541
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,960
bouncing a photon off of the object and

1542
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,880
then it's that Photon that you're

1543
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,819
detecting

1544
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:07,799
right oh there there was one other

1545
01:07:07,799 --> 01:07:11,819
question that uh can be answered quickly

1546
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:15,119
it was the question about uh what's the

1547
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,740
reference frame

1548
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:21,780
yeah uh Alice is using when she's uh

1549
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:24,420
measuring up or down measuring her spin

1550
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,440
up or down

1551
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,140
and of course they're they're several

1552
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:30,440
reference frames involved here

1553
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:35,700
uh so let's work inwards uh in a real

1554
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,280
system Alice is sitting here she's got a

1555
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,740
Stern gerlock apparatus which is a

1556
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,619
vertical magnet apparatus

1557
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:46,200
and she's measuring the spin of an

1558
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,180
electron that's that's traveling through

1559
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:51,059
this Stern gerlock device and what the

1560
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:53,880
certain gurlock device does is is Orient

1561
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,880
the spin uh with a magnetic field that's

1562
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,099
that's not homogeneous so it ends up

1563
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:02,039
pointing physically up

1564
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:05,640
uh as it comes through the apparatus

1565
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,839
so

1566
01:08:06,839 --> 01:08:10,020
how is that apparatus oriented I mean

1567
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,299
what defines the up direction for that

1568
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:13,619
apparatus

1569
01:08:13,619 --> 01:08:16,080
well in the Practical setting what

1570
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,020
defines that

1571
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,460
apparatus orientation is the Earth's

1572
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:23,279
gravitational field right we're sitting

1573
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,319
we're in we're here in the laboratory

1574
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,120
and the Earth's gravitational field

1575
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,339
tells us what direction is down it's

1576
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:31,380
toward the center of the Earth

1577
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,140
and so up is away from the center of the

1578
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,479
earth and that's what defines the axis

1579
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,120
for the apparatus which is a great big

1580
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,399
piece of metal so it's very responsive

1581
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:44,698
to the gravitational field

1582
01:08:44,698 --> 01:08:47,640
so now we can ask about Alice right

1583
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,439
Alice is also embedded in this

1584
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:51,319
gravitational field

1585
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:54,899
and she also can detect the

1586
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:56,880
gravitational field she can tell which

1587
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,100
way is down toward the center of the

1588
01:08:59,100 --> 01:08:59,880
Earth

1589
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,600
by the the force acting on her feet

1590
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,899
and that measurement is taking place in

1591
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:08,640
Alice's brain

1592
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,939
so in Alice's brain there's a

1593
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,759
representation of which way is up and

1594
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:17,520
that's the internal reference frame of

1595
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,060
Alice that lets her do the experiment

1596
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,660
you know if she was freely floating in

1597
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,679
space

1598
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,219
but the apparatus was anchored to the

1599
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:31,319
gravitational field

1600
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:33,299
she wouldn't be able to tell that it was

1601
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:34,979
anchored to the gravitational field

1602
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:37,679
that's Einstein's the point that

1603
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,299
Einstein makes in all of those

1604
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:41,339
experiments where he has observers

1605
01:09:41,339 --> 01:09:43,500
flying around in spacecraft

1606
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,380
uh that they have to have their own

1607
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:48,238
reference frame

1608
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:51,779
oh what what Einstein didn't emphasize

1609
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:53,939
was that reference frame is in their

1610
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,699
head it's encoded by their nervous

1611
01:09:56,699 --> 01:09:57,780
system

1612
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:02,040
oh so uh I I think it was Daniel who

1613
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,699
said this exactly correctly that uh the

1614
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:10,080
physical object uh in her head that the

1615
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,880
actual neural network that tells her

1616
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,460
which way the gravitational field is

1617
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:18,360
uh is itself a semantic object I mean

1618
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,760
that's that's what

1619
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,940
gives the word up and down meaning for

1620
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:26,340
Alice and what is what is what do I mean

1621
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,679
when I say the word meaning I mean it

1622
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:31,800
lets her take some action

1623
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:32,719
um

1624
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:37,199
semantics boils down to actionability if

1625
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,360
it gives things significance

1626
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,520
and this this was the point that that

1627
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,260
Bateson was making when he said

1628
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:45,600
differences that make a difference

1629
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,620
uh for a for an organism

1630
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,020
something is Meaningful if it actually

1631
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:54,920
makes a difference for what I can do

1632
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:58,020
uh in this world that I'm trying to

1633
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,179
survive in

1634
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:03,239
oh so I'll I'll leave it at that but

1635
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:07,260
this is this is very very useful for uh

1636
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,300
leading off the next session so thank

1637
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,040
you very much for for all of that

1638
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,780
discussion

1639
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,719
awesome thank you I guess if I could say

1640
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:18,239
one thing here is that let me scroll

1641
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,300
back up to the three points early in the

1642
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,560
night

1643
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,140
differences that make a difference

1644
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,719
would tell you that you require action

1645
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:30,719
to to perturb the system and measure and

1646
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,820
then the semantics or the contextuality

1647
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:35,460
that may be encoded in in the in the

1648
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:38,280
nervous system would tell you what is

1649
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,840
the difference that it's being made

1650
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,179
would that be correct yeah

1651
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:44,640
right what what tells you that there's a

1652
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,920
difference there it's it's what what

1653
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,260
you're able to detect and represent

1654
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,480
internally

1655
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:54,719
oh it's almost like step one do

1656
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,600
differently step two you have to ask it

1657
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,239
to a different thing and then three you

1658
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:04,320
need the semantic frame that makes a and

1659
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,980
b different

1660
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:10,639
differences all the way down

1661
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,920
um well we will

1662
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,980
transcribe this and fix the few patchy

1663
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:19,199
moments enter we'll work together on

1664
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,360
updating the transcript so that

1665
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:25,560
everybody who wants to be well prepared

1666
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,080
for the measurement of the third lecture

1667
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,600
will be absolutely in place

1668
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,960
