1
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:07,223
Daniel: Hello.

2
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:10,151
It's July 1, 2023.

3
00:00:10,163 --> 00:00:12,354
We're in “Physics as Information

4
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:14,582
Processing” in the second discussion.

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,851
So thanks all for joining, and we'll see

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,971
who else comes in.

7
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:21,219
If you're watching Live, feel free to

8
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:21,219
write questions in the Live chat and I'll

9
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:25,626
relay them onwards.

10
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:26,755
So Ander,

11
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:27,821
thanks,

12
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,056
nd it would be awesome to begin with a

13
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:29,056
little bit of some overview and some

14
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:33,471
points that you wanted to get to.

15
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,616
Ander: Yeah.

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,730
Thank you, Daniel.

17
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:38,938
So, good morning, everyone.

18
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:44,555
So if you would start what Chris spoke

19
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:47,824
about last time.

20
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:51,255
I have a few slides that I singled out.

21
00:00:52,388 --> 00:00:57,872
So now we're getting to reformulation of

22
00:00:57,872 --> 00:00:57,872
quantum theory in terms of reformulation

23
00:00:57,872 --> 00:01:06,161
of opposed to dynamical theory.

24
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:10,531
And as we've talked in previous sessions,

25
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:10,531
we need to think a little bit

26
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:10,531
philosophically about what the ontology

27
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:16,170
of measurement entails.

28
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:20,577
So Chris last lecture started with these

29
00:01:20,577 --> 00:01:22,755
three basic ingredients.

30
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:29,478
So an action that's, number one, a thing

31
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:31,649
to ask about.

32
00:01:31,669 --> 00:01:34,917
This is the qubit, the physical degrees

33
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:34,917
of freedom that we need to perturb in

34
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:38,337
some way to ask a question.

35
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:41,629
And then finally, a semantics, a language

36
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:41,629
that makes sense, a context that makes

37
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:41,629
sense of that information that we gather.

38
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:46,013
.

39
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:53,083
So I should say, number one, I came up in

40
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:53,083
the first question when I can't exactly

41
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:58,138
remember.

42
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:01,102
But at some point, we talked about what

43
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:02,112
is information?

44
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:06,152
And we came up with or we brought up a

45
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:06,152
definition that goes something like this.

46
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:09,189
.

47
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:10,197
It's a nice adage.

48
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,219
It's “a differences that make a

49
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,228
difference.”

50
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:17,263
This is… Chris told me… I can't remember

51
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:17,263
who first coined this adage, but I think

52
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:24,331
it's quite old, at least early 70s.

53
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:27,362
Anyway, so number one, basically perturb

54
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:28,375
that part, right?

55
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:30,397
If I want to gather some information, I

56
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:32,415
need to perturb a system somehow.

57
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:33,428
So I need to act.

58
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:37,460
And this is literally in units of actions,

59
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:37,465
, right?

60
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:39,488
So units of energy times time.

61
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:43,526
And he provided the example of rhodopsin,

62
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:43,526
which is apparently near optimal from a

63
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:49,582
quantum perspective.

64
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:52,611
This is mechanically what goes on in your

65
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:53,628
eyes as light comes in.

66
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,650
And this is clearly the difference that

67
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,668
makes a difference in your brain.

68
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,653
The second part were the physical degrees

69
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:02,659
of freedom.

70
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,718
So recall that we had a boundary, okay?

71
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,762
So this theory of quantum mechanics as

72
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:13,762
measurement necessarily breaks down the

73
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:13,762
system into a bipartite system with a

74
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:13,762
boundary, which […] are a lot smaller

75
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:13,762
than the degrees of freedom of A and B,

76
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:13,762
at least in terms of the dimension of the

77
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:39,022
Hilbert space and media change.

78
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:42,055
Daniel: Sorry, can you repeat, Ander?

79
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:44,072
Ander: Repeat what?

80
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:46,093
Daniel: Sorry, just last 30 seconds.

81
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:47,104
Ander: Yeah.

82
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:50,137
So the second ingredient is the physical

83
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:50,137
medium in which this information exchange

84
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:50,137
occurs, where the physical degrees of

85
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:50,137
freedom, the qubits, are arranged, and

86
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:50,137
these are physically perturbed in order

87
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:50,137
to mediate that difference that makes a

88
00:03:50,137 --> 00:04:08,250
difference.

89
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:11,281
So we can think of this dually as either

90
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:11,281
preparing those qubits or decoding those

91
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:13,308
qubits.

92
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,365
And then finally, there was the notion of

93
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:21,387
the reference frame.

94
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:26,432
Okay, so the theory necessitates a free

95
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:26,432
choice of the agent of a reference frame.

96
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,474
.

97
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:34,516
And physically what this amounts to is a

98
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:34,516
free choice of a measurement axis for

99
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:40,570
those qubits.

100
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,600
So we can think of measuring z spin in

101
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,623
those qubits on the boundary.

102
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:49,667
So that requires a free choice of that

103
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:50,674
axis.

104
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:54,713
And this amounts to your reference frame,

105
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:54,713
the context in which those measurements

106
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:58,751
are performed.

107
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:01,722
On one extreme case, we have that if

108
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:01,722
those references are perfectly aligned,

109
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:01,722
then the exchange of information is

110
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:08,791
noiseless.

111
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:08,799
There.

112
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:10,815
Was it somewhere over here?

113
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:13,842
I think I can't quite recall.

114
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:15,865
But generically, these two reference

115
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:15,865
frames of Alice and Bob, A and B are not

116
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:19,903
exactly the same.

117
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,927
They get to choose the reference frames.

118
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:24,952
I think it's all the way on the bottom,

119
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:24,958
actually.

120
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,979
Right, so they can be aligned.

121
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:28,999
If they're aligned, they are exchanging

122
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:30,011
noiseless information.

123
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:30,016
Right.

124
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:36,070
There is no randomness if they are not

125
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,098
superposition onto.

126
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,127
And that's when you're going to get

127
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:43,146
probabilities in the outcomes.

128
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:45,161
Trivial probabilities.

129
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,184
So far, so good.

130
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:49,208
Yes.

131
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:54,251
Okay, so I have a few more comments of

132
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:56,270
the main things.

133
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,280
Okay.

134
00:05:57,282 --> 00:05:59,303
It'll take me a few minutes and then we

135
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:00,257
can chat back and forth.

136
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:06,319
Perhaps this slide is interesting,

137
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,337
important.

138
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:11,364
I remember this is where I asked the

139
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:11,364
question myself, because it's not easy to

140
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:11,364
wrap your head around what's going on

141
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:17,425
here.

142
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:19,445
So we said that measurement and

143
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:19,445
preparation are completely dual pictures.

144
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,469
.

145
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,510
So this is going to be expanded on in the

146
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,520
next lecture.

147
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:30,550
But a jerk corollary of that is that if

148
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,550
you prepare Chris said it in similar

149
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,550
terms, if you prepare something in a

150
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,550
certain state and then you measure it

151
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,550
right away, you should expect that it's

152
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:42,678
still in that state, right?

153
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,709
So, intuitively speaking, this induces a

154
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:45,709
cycle, right, where you have preparation

155
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:45,709
and measurement and you're back to square

156
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:53,782
one, so to speak.

157
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:59,844
And in generating that cycle, obviously

158
00:06:59,844 --> 00:06:59,844
there has to be some notion of time,

159
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:04,839
right?

160
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:09,884
So that's where we're going to have to

161
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:09,884
make sense of the distinction between

162
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:15,941
internal and external time.

163
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:17,965
If we take this measurement operator and

164
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:17,965
here perform some operations, we can

165
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:17,965
write it as a unitary propagator from

166
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:17,965
quantum mechanics, which again preserves

167
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:24,039
information.

168
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,059
It just leaves the state as it is.

169
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:31,102
But with this little trick of the week

170
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:31,102
rotation, you can write it as e to the

171
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:36,153
measurement up to a constant.

172
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,179
And that precisely encodes, at least

173
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:38,179
morally speaking, what we just said,

174
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:38,179
right, that this preparation measurement

175
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:38,179
thing is a cycle, and more importantly,

176
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:49,284
it gets rid of this t external time.

177
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:54,334
And presumably in here it's going to be

178
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:54,334
replaced by some notion of internal time.

179
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:58,375
.

180
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:02,353
We're going to have an internal time QRF,

181
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:02,353
that is the true local time, as the

182
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:07,403
observer perceives.

183
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:12,453
I'm not entirely certain of the details,

184
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:12,453
but now, looking at it, here the beta,

185
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:12,453
which presumably there's beta and inverse

186
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:21,547
temperature here.

187
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,573
I think this is going to be intimately

188
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:26,593
related to notions of thermal time.

189
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:28,612
This has been explored in papers by

190
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:28,612
[Carlo] Rovelli called Internal Time

191
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:28,612
Reversal[?] [[Rovelli (1993) Statistical

192
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:28,612
mechanics of gravity and the

193
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:28,612
thermodynamical origin of time]]. And

194
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:28,612
Thermal Time is the way in which the

195
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:39,726
observer observes the passage of time.

196
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,763
Those papers of Rovelli are linked in the

197
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:44,773
Q and A by the way.

198
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,799
So I can also provide links later.

199
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:51,846
I think there might have been a question.

200
00:08:51,846 --> 00:08:51,846
.

201
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:52,857
Should I stop?

202
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:53,866
Daniel: Yeah, Dean.

203
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,876
Go for it.

204
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:59,919
Dean: I was curious about this because

205
00:08:59,919 --> 00:08:59,919
what I heard Chris start this session

206
00:08:59,919 --> 00:08:59,919
with was that he was going to try to help

207
00:08:59,919 --> 00:08:59,919
us understand when we are looking at

208
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:12,991
something through a mechanical lens.

209
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:16,035
So quantum mechanics and to me this slide

210
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:16,035
was the way of addressing, as he said his

211
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:16,035
words were characterized information

212
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:16,035
transfer in a quantum theoretic way that

213
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:16,035
the translation from H to M took the

214
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:16,035
mechanics aspect out of the change or

215
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:36,234
timepiece.

216
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:39,263
It was the purification, the most

217
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:39,263
theoretical form of transfer of

218
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:39,263
information as opposed to holding up just

219
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:39,263
the one ordered or sequenced or

220
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:49,368
mechanical lens.

221
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:53,406
I heard you ask the question and I kind

222
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:53,406
of smiled because I thought to myself no,

223
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:53,406
I understand why Anders is asking this

224
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:59,466
question.

225
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:04,450
It's can something be both gripper in the

226
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:04,450
conceptual meaning sense ontologically

227
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:11,521
and gripped a physical object.

228
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,546
And I think what I thought maybe I was

229
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,556
misinterpreting.

230
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:18,591
I'd like what your perspective on this is.

231
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:18,591
.

232
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:21,626
That ability to go from H to M is what

233
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:21,626
allows us to have both the mechanical and

234
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:26,679
the theoretical.

235
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,716
The transference in its purest sense is

236
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:30,716
that being able to have both can be true.

237
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:34,754
.

238
00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:37,782
Is that what it is?

239
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:38,796
Ander: Yes, for sure.

240
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:42,836
Yeah.

241
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,909
Much else to say here.

242
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:54,957
It is true that you can think of the

243
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:54,957
information transfer picture as an

244
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:54,957
enlargement or an addition to the

245
00:10:54,957 --> 00:11:01,960
mechanical picture.

246
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,981
And that I don't think that the

247
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:03,981
mechanical picture has to be just thrown

248
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:06,017
out completely.

249
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:10,051
I think it's interesting to keep it to

250
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:10,051
see how it can be recovered from the

251
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:15,102
information processing picture.

252
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:18,130
This reminds me actually there is an

253
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,130
Italian physicist, I think his name is

254
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:21,168
Kiribella.

255
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:24,192
And Dean, if you want, I can link you the

256
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:24,192
papers later who is very fond of the

257
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:24,192
information theoretical approach to

258
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:24,192
quantum mechanics and deducing quantum

259
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:32,274
mechanics from first principles.

260
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:37,322
And he has a paper, I think the title is

261
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:37,322
Physics without Physics or something like

262
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:37,322
that, where he treats this whole thing as

263
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:37,322
a big seller automaton and by taking

264
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:37,322
appropriate scaling limits he derives QFT

265
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:58,534
non interacting QFT.

266
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:02,515
So he says, okay, let me start with some

267
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:02,515
axioms how information should be

268
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:07,566
information processing.

269
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:11,609
I mean, I'm very loose here.

270
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,643
Then get a cellular automaton out of this

271
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:15,643
and then take scaling and recover QFT,

272
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:21,701
non interacting QFT at least.

273
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:24,730
So start with a few axioms about

274
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:24,730
information processing, recover mechanics

275
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,771
from that.

276
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:31,803
Does that add to your question a little

277
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:31,805
bit?

278
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:32,817
Dean: Yeah.

279
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:36,853
All I'm trying to do is tie this back

280
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:36,853
into some of the live streams that we've

281
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:39,880
done in the past.

282
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:41,904
And I know I use different language.

283
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:45,941
I am not a scientist and I've not studied

284
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:45,941
quantum other than sort of in passing

285
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:49,980
ways.

286
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,011
But I do think that what this spoke to me

287
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:52,011
about was something that I've always

288
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:52,011
tried to include, which is that there's

289
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:52,011
the figure it out piece, which to me is

290
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:52,011
the conceptual and the meaning part that

291
00:12:52,011 --> 00:13:07,100
Chris talked about very clearly here.

292
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:09,123
And then there's the outing of the figure.

293
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:09,123
.

294
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:12,154
There's this sort of physical edge and

295
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:12,154
boundary that if you don't have an

296
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:12,154
awareness of both things happening

297
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:12,154
concurrently the preparation and the

298
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:12,154
measure are a unitary of sort of minimum

299
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:27,302
of two state then all bets are off.

300
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:30,339
In terms of being able to think of these

301
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:30,339
propagators and operators and all of the

302
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:30,339
ways that we're trying to explain the

303
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:40,433
situation they're off.

304
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:42,456
So we have to have both.

305
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:46,497
We have to have that sense that there is

306
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:50,532
a transfer and there is the mechanics.

307
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:52,557
We have to keep both juggling all the

308
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:53,561
time.

309
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:58,609
So that's where this one particular slide

310
00:13:58,609 --> 00:13:58,609
was really quite both bias-confirming for

311
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:03,602
me.

312
00:14:03,604 --> 00:14:06,636
But I think it also, as you say, is going

313
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:08,658
to open up a lot that July.

314
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,670
Ander: Yeah, I agree.

315
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:13,700
I think this might be the most important

316
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,722
or mysterious situation slide.

317
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:16,733
Dean: Yeah.

318
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,754
And it turns the pyramid, the

319
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:18,754
conventional approach here's a pyramid

320
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:18,754
into a top that can be spun [Laughs]

321
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:26,834
essentially with a Wick rotation.

322
00:14:26,836 --> 00:14:29,864
And it validates how information transfer

323
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:29,864
probably gets short shrift in most of

324
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:34,909
this quantum conversation.

325
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,953
But it's probably at least an equal to

326
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:40,977
the mechanical part.

327
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:43,001
What order are we delivering this

328
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,012
information in?

329
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,032
At that point

330
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:47,039
I'll stop.

331
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,046
Daniel: Thanks.

332
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:53,099
Alexey.

333
00:14:54,113 --> 00:14:55,128
Alexey: Hi, can you hear me?

334
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:56,136
Daniel: Yes.

335
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:02,136
Alexey: My mathematics teacher in high

336
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:02,136
school used to say this is beautiful, but

337
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:05,163
I don't quite understand it.

338
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:08,190
So I wanted to maybe I have two questions,

339
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,215
, but I'll start with this simpler one.

340
00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:13,246
So when Chris talked about the reference

341
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:13,246
frame and said common language, I think

342
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:13,246
in Shannon common language is the

343
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:20,311
alphabet.

344
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:22,332
There's a receiver and Sandra and the

345
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:23,346
alphabet that they share.

346
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:26,375
And then Chris said this reference frame

347
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:26,375
is a physical thing like neurons or hands

348
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:30,411
or mouth.

349
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:33,442
And then I got lost because if when I

350
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:33,442
encode I modify something on the hard

351
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:33,442
drive, then the physical components of

352
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:42,539
the hard drive is the reference frame.

353
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,572
But this is not the shared language.

354
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:48,597
So that's my first question.

355
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:50,611
Maybe I'll stop here.

356
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,644
I understand we're dealing in metaphors,

357
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:53,644
but I want to understand that the

358
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:53,644
reference frame up or down, if Bob and

359
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:53,644
Alice understand it similarly, then is

360
00:15:53,644 --> 00:16:01,664
that really physical?

361
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:07,721
Ander: I think answer is that Chris

362
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:08,730
would

363
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,748
probably give a better answer…

364
00:16:09,748 --> 00:16:09,749
Daniel: Start from the beginning, Ander.

365
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,749
Go.

366
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:14,795
Ander: … is that both are true at the

367
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:15,809
same time.

368
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,829
I think Chris would give you a better

369
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:18,834
answer.

370
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:22,875
But the semantics or sorry, the sherling,

371
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:22,875
which a reference frame has to have

372
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:22,875
physical embodiment and that's a piece of

373
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:31,961
hardware.

374
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:32,977
It's a neuron or something.

375
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:36,019
In this case, it's your free choice of

376
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:36,019
the spin axis, and that's your reference

377
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:41,060
frame.

378
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,078
But at the same time, it's it's a

379
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:42,078
physical it's a physical piece of

380
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:45,102
hardware.

381
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:48,129
So reference frames are both the piece of

382
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:50,155
hardware but also a piece of semantics.

383
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:54,191
Alexey: So if I take it from the language

384
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:54,191
I don't quite understand to computer

385
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:56,212
science.

386
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:58,234
So if Alice and Bob communicate through a

387
00:16:58,234 --> 00:16:58,234
piece of memory, whether it's Random

388
00:16:58,234 --> 00:16:58,234
Access Memory hard drive, then Alice

389
00:16:58,234 --> 00:16:58,234
encodes something on that hard drive and

390
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:06,250
Bob reads from the hard drive.

391
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:08,270
So in that sense, they understand how to

392
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:08,270
encode and decode, but they use the same

393
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:08,270
physical piece that's the reference frame.

394
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,311
.

395
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:13,323
Would that be correct?

396
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,369
Daniel: I might just add one again.

397
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:21,404
Continuing with the computer science and

398
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:21,404
the Shannon alphabet, let's just say that

399
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:21,404
these are plain text character encodings.

400
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:27,467
.

401
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,506
And so they share the same set of

402
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:31,506
character, A through Z encodings that is

403
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:39,585
reflected somewhere physically.

404
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:44,634
And so if a message were sent from

405
00:17:44,634 --> 00:17:44,634
another letter, it wouldn't render

406
00:17:44,634 --> 00:17:50,692
properly.

407
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:53,720
It's like outside, they couldn't

408
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:53,720
differentiate Omega from zeta because

409
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:53,720
they only have the A through Z software

410
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,732
pack.

411
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:03,768
And so there's an informational

412
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:03,768
distinguishment that's facilitated by the

413
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:03,768
information that's classically inscribed

414
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:14,870
on the screen, the memory.

415
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:19,924
And there is an embodied physical as well

416
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:23,968
as a semantic aspect to that situation.

417
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,001
Alexey: All right, I think I'm getting

418
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:29,002
closer to understanding.

419
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:31,004
So, to move away from computer science,

420
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:31,004
if Ellis is a painter, she took a brush,

421
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:31,004
dipped it in red paint and painted on the

422
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:37,010
canvas red.

423
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,013
And Bob has the same understanding of red

424
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:40,013
as Ellis.

425
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:42,015
And then he looked at the canvas and red.

426
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:42,015
.

427
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:42,015
Red.

428
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:46,019
Then it is both the physical mark on the

429
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:48,021
canvas and the symbol of red.

430
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:49,022
Right?

431
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:51,024
Ander: Yes.

432
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:54,027
Daniel: And if somebody had red green

433
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:54,027
colorblindness that physical apparatus

434
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:54,027
was not able to informationally

435
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:54,027
distinguish, then they couldn't make this

436
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:54,027
wick rotation into the quantum cognitive

437
00:18:54,027 --> 00:19:06,033
space.

438
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:09,036
They wouldn't be able to detect that

439
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:09,036
there was a red figure painted on a green

440
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:13,040
background.

441
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:19,046
Ander: A key component here is that the

442
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:21,048
reference frame is inside of the agent.

443
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:24,051
If you are colorblind, there is something

444
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:24,051
physical inside of your head or your eyes

445
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:24,051
or whatever, that does not allow you to

446
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:31,058
see the difference.

447
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,064
So your semantics are affected ultimately

448
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:40,067
by a physical piece of hardware.

449
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:43,070
Alexey: Yeah, maybe I use the bad example,

450
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,070
, because color actually is computed in

451
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,070
the brain and colorblindness is not

452
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,074
necessarily physical.

453
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
Okay.

454
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:50,077
But I think I get it closer.

455
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:53,080
But if I may ask another question, I get

456
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
lost with a saying that preparation and

457
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
measurement are they have to happen both.

458
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:59,086
.

459
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:02,083
And that when you prepare or when you

460
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,085
read, you modify.

461
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:06,087
So I am okay with the act of writing, the

462
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:08,088
act of encoding.

463
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:11,092
So when I encode something such as I mark

464
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:11,092
red on the canvas or I write to the hard

465
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:16,097
drive A, I modify the hard drive.

466
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:19,100
That is true, but if I am asking a

467
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,100
question right, I am not modifying

468
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,105
anything on the canvas.

469
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:26,107
So in what way the act of asking the

470
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:26,107
question or preparation is modifying the

471
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:29,110
qubit.

472
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,112
This is where I'm lost.

473
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:33,114
Does that make sense?

474
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:36,117
Ander: Yeah, I think this is exactly a

475
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
question I asked to Chris in in the

476
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
stream, so I can't quite remember his

477
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:41,122
answer.

478
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:43,124
But I think it was basically that they're

479
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:44,125
completely dual pictures.

480
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:49,130
Duality in the sense of they're both two

481
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:49,130
ways of looking at the same thing,

482
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:49,130
evolving towards the future, or you have

483
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:59,140
time symmetry.

484
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,135
You can do either.

485
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:02,137
Yeah.

486
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:07,142
So I myself am slightly confused by the

487
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:07,142
very but I think the answer is that they

488
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:07,142
are painting at the same the picture of

489
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:17,152
or am I preparing?

490
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,154
Are just completely dual.

491
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,158
Do you remember that, Daniel?

492
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,159
Yeah.

493
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:24,159
Okay.

494
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,162
Daniel: I'll give a different angle than

495
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,164
the formal duality relationship.

496
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:32,167
So let's think about our measuring device

497
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
is going to be a carpet, and we're

498
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
interested in whether somebody has walked

499
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:38,173
on the carpet.

500
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:42,177
So to prepare the carpet, we comb it very

501
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:45,180
nicely in one direction.

502
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,183
And I'm sure there's analogies there with

503
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:48,183
the preparation of qubits in a quantum

504
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:51,186
computer.

505
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:55,190
But we're going to comb the carpet as an

506
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,190
act of preparation, and then something is

507
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:01,190
going to happen.

508
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,192
Maybe it's a split second later, and so

509
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
we're very confident that it should be

510
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
still nicely combed, or maybe it's going

511
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:10,199
to be a whole working day later.

512
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:13,202
But now we're going to take that probe,

513
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:13,202
the tip, whatever it may be, and we're

514
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:13,202
going to run it along the carpet, and we'

515
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:13,202
're going to measure the state of the

516
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:25,214
direction of the fibers of the carpet.

517
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:30,219
So if we didn't prepare the measurements,

518
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
we wouldn't have a calibrated reference

519
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
point to know how things had even changed.

520
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:38,227
.

521
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:43,232
And so there's a cycle of preparing the

522
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:43,232
apparatus through something like a

523
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:43,232
calibration or at least like an emptying

524
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:43,232
of memory, to be able to then make an

525
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:43,232
observation and to have that observation

526
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:43,232
have the kind of meaning that we would

527
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:43,232
have expected, like purge the photo

528
00:22:43,232 --> 00:23:05,248
detector, make the measurement.

529
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:06,249
Now you have to purge it again.

530
00:23:07,249 --> 00:23:08,251
That's the preparation.

531
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:09,252
What do you think, Alexey?

532
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:13,256
Alexey: That is a beautiful metaphor, and

533
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:13,256
I dig that, except I think I heard Chris

534
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:13,256
say that when you prepare, you may qubit

535
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:19,262
into up or down.

536
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:21,264
And this is what I'm lost, because when

537
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:22,265
you comb the carpet, you don't do that.

538
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:24,267
You don't put the footstep on it.

539
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:26,269
In fact, there may not be any footstep.

540
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:26,269
Dean: Right.

541
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,272
Alexey: And this is where I'm missing, I

542
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:30,273
think, in quantum physics as well.

543
00:23:31,273 --> 00:23:33,276
If you measure the cause and effect,

544
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
relationships are broken here for me, if

545
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
in my act of preparation, I'm opening my

546
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
canvas to read the message, but I do not

547
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:42,285
know what the message will be, I'm game.

548
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:45,288
But if he's saying that when I prepare, I

549
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:45,288
modify the carpet such that it becomes

550
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:45,288
either up or down, actually not blank,

551
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:52,294
but up or down.

552
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:53,296
Then I'm lost.

553
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:56,299
Daniel: You have to comb the carpet up or

554
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:56,299
down.

555
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:58,301
There's no blank carpet.

556
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:03,300
So you have an Etch A Sketch.

557
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,302
You could either make all the pixels

558
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:05,302
white and then you'd be able to measure a

559
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:05,302
message in the dark or you can make all

560
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:05,302
the message dark or the slate dark, and

561
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:05,302
then you could be able to measure

562
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:05,302
something that was light, but you pick a

563
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:05,302
direction of polarization in your

564
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:05,302
preparation or calibration step so that

565
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:05,302
deviations from that can be the

566
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:25,322
measurement.

567
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:30,327
Alexey: So you're saying carpet is

568
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:30,327
binary?

569
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:32,329
Carpet doesn't have multiple states.

570
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:33,330
Carpet can only have two states.

571
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,333
So if I prepare it, I effectively put it

572
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,335
in one of those states.

573
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:42,339
Daniel: Well, let's say we had the carpet

574
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:44,341
at a 45 degree angle.

575
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:47,344
Mathematically we could describe that as

576
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:47,344
a mixed state, and it may not be the most

577
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:47,344
effective for measuring the movement of

578
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:47,344
people across the carpet, but yeah, you

579
00:24:47,344 --> 00:25:00,351
could define it or comb it that way.

580
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:04,355
If it were only a binary, it wouldn't be

581
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:04,355
a qubit then it would be a classical bit,

582
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:09,360
actually.

583
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:11,362
Yeah, under.

584
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:12,363
Go for it.

585
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:14,365
Ander: Yeah.

586
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:20,371
If I recall lecture a couple of slides

587
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:20,371
more, we briefly talked about it like ten

588
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:26,377
minutes ago.

589
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:30,381
By preparing, you are choosing an axis

590
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
and whatever you up or down in that axis.

591
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:34,385
.

592
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:36,387
Now, that doesn't mean that the

593
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:36,387
environment gets to do its own thing,

594
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:38,389
right?

595
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:45,396
And superposition of outcomes, but at

596
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
least you're measuring in that axis,

597
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:49,400
right?

598
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,403
So it's going to be either up or down in

599
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:54,405
that two pictures.

600
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:00,405
I just want to see a few words on screens,

601
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:00,405
, on the fine line diagrams and maybe

602
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:06,411
clarify question a little more.

603
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:11,416
Daniel: Dean.

604
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:13,418
Dean: On this.

605
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:15,420
Really interesting.

606
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,424
I don't know how metaphorically you could

607
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:19,424
explain the carpet as a wave, but I think

608
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:19,424
once you get away from the it's up or

609
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:19,424
down, that possibility enters the

610
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:31,436
conversation.

611
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:34,439
And the only reason I wonder whether or

612
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
not metaphorically, the wave aspect of

613
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
that can be included in how you're

614
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
describing the carpet is that Chris spent

615
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
quite a bit of time on the all possible

616
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:47,452
paths argument.

617
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:51,456
And in particular, and I love this, when

618
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:54,459
Alice isn't looking right.

619
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:58,463
Well, in that wave equation, how could

620
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:00,459
Alice not be looking?

621
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:05,464
That's what gets real.

622
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:09,468
I mean, Alice could not be looking if it'

623
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:09,468
's binary, if it's or up or down, but if

624
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:14,473
it's wave, it's on.

625
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:17,476
It's a unitary propagator.

626
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:21,480
I'm not sure how she takes her eyes off

627
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,480
of this preparation measure thing that's

628
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:28,487
going off all the time.

629
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:32,491
So this is actually what I consider to be

630
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
a feature or an opportunity or an opening

631
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
in the sense that from a strictly

632
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
information transfer piece not a

633
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
mechanical piece now, not a physical

634
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
thing from an information transfer piece,

635
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
maybe the carpet can be metaphorically

636
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:51,510
understood as a wave.

637
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:55,514
That the eyes of Alice or whoever's doing

638
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:57,516
the preparing and the measuring.

639
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:58,517
Bob, Alice.

640
00:27:58,517 --> 00:27:59,518
I don't care.

641
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:02,515
Peaches that there is actually a

642
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:02,515
difference, then between something that

643
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:02,515
is exchanged and something that is

644
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:10,523
informationally transferred.

645
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,525
And again, I don't think that the four of

646
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:12,525
us here sitting right now are going to

647
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,528
resolve that.

648
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:21,534
But I wonder if part of the difficulty in

649
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:21,534
this is finding the physical metaphor

650
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:21,534
that explains the theoretical transfer in

651
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:21,534
such a way that both breaks the symmetry

652
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:38,551
and holds it.

653
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:39,552
Because again, we're back to gripper and

654
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,553
grip.

655
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,555
We're back to figuring it out and outing

656
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:42,555
the physical figures in the state that we'

657
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:46,559
're in.

658
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,562
And we have to do both at once.

659
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:53,566
So again, Daniel, you're the creative guy.

660
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:53,566
.

661
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,569
How do you turn your carpet metaphor into

662
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:57,570
a wave equation?

663
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:02,569
Daniel: Maybe there's a subwoofer in the

664
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:02,569
room or maybe somebody is waving the

665
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:06,573
carpet.

666
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:11,578
But what you said about what is exchanged

667
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:11,578
and what is transferred, maybe the

668
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:20,587
transfer is the classical component.

669
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:23,590
I don't know which one will be exchange

670
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,590
or transferred, but one of them is the

671
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,594
classical inscription.

672
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:29,596
That's how many gigabytes were written or

673
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:31,598
read to the hard drive.

674
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:34,601
But what's exchanged, let's just say, are

675
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,603
the semantics of meaning.

676
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:40,607
And given an appropriate Copeparation,

677
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
maybe only one bit needs to be

678
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
transferred for the exchange of a message

679
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
that was already triggered to be set off.

680
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:52,619
.

681
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:56,623
And then also, this entire discussion, it

682
00:29:56,623 --> 00:29:56,623
kind of strikes me as like the Cartesian

683
00:29:56,623 --> 00:30:02,623
duality of our time.

684
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:06,627
But rather than mind and body, it's the

685
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:06,627
physicality of information syntax and the

686
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:06,627
metaphysicality of information semantics.

687
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:13,634
.

688
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:17,638
And that's these kind of two worlds with

689
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:17,638
their own physics and metaphysics that we'

690
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:23,644
're trying to connect.

691
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:27,648
And it's like, similarly well, how does

692
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
the information world cause something

693
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:31,652
physical?

694
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:35,656
How does the physical cause somethingal?

695
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:38,659
And I think that the entire journey that

696
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:38,659
the course and everyone is on is physics

697
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:38,659
as information processing, those as a

698
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:38,659
qualified and distinguished but minimum

699
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:49,670
of two set.

700
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,671
Alexey?

701
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:52,673
Alexey: Yeah.

702
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:53,674
Thank you so much.

703
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:54,675
Can you hear me?

704
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:55,676
Ander: Yeah.

705
00:30:57,678 --> 00:30:58,679
Alexey: Thinking out loud?

706
00:30:58,679 --> 00:30:58,679
Ander: Maybe.

707
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,675
Alexey: But I think the way to get closer

708
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:00,675
to understanding in my head is to let go

709
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:00,675
of the metaphor of asking a question,

710
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:05,680
right?

711
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,682
So if Alexi is talking to Daniel through

712
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:07,682
zoom and I pose even a closed question,

713
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:10,685
up or down.

714
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:14,689
So I formulated the question and released

715
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:16,691
it into zoom space.

716
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:18,693
And then I'm silent and I opened my

717
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:20,695
listening to your answer.

718
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:23,698
But you, Daniel, have agency to say up or

719
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:24,699
down.

720
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:26,701
I do not have any effect on whether you

721
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:28,703
will say up or down.

722
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:28,703
Right?

723
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:29,704
That's the difference.

724
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:32,707
So me asking you a question does not

725
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:34,709
modify the answer.

726
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:35,710
You decide.

727
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,711
Alice talking to Bob.

728
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:39,714
Bob has the agency to answer the question,

729
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:40,715
, not Alice.

730
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:42,717
And that's where I'm stuck.

731
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:44,719
So I don't know if asking a question

732
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:45,720
continues to be a good metaphor.

733
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,723
Preparing the instrument for measurement

734
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:50,724
is maybe better.

735
00:31:51,725 --> 00:31:53,728
But actually, Ellis is not asking Bob.

736
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:55,730
Ellis is acting on a qubit.

737
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,731
Right.

738
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:59,734
And qubit is is a simple thing that, you

739
00:31:59,734 --> 00:31:59,734
know, can can literally physically be up

740
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:03,732
or down, I guess.

741
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:05,734
And so that's that's maybe, maybe that's

742
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:07,736
the answer that Ellis is not asking.

743
00:32:07,736 --> 00:32:10,739
Bob Ellis does something to the qubit and

744
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:10,739
because qubit can be up or down, then

745
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:15,744
that's no longer asking a question.

746
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:17,746
Asking a question implies your

747
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:20,749
correspondent can tell you anything.

748
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:25,754
Daniel: When we're dealing with the very

749
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:25,754
sophisticated process of natural language

750
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:25,754
question asking, I think we're dealing

751
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:25,754
with something that's orders of

752
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:25,754
composition above the kind of binary ask.

753
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:40,769
.

754
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:42,771
So I agree with that.

755
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:45,774
It's almost like Alice prepares the

756
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:45,774
photoreceptor so its slate is refreshed

757
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:45,774
and then it's the photon or the light

758
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:45,774
emitting object that has the agency to

759
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:57,786
send the photon or not.

760
00:32:57,786 --> 00:33:01,784
I mean, maybe the preparation occurs and

761
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
then no one comes back to check whether

762
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:08,791
or not agency was even exerted.

763
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:11,794
And I think when we really focus on the

764
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:11,794
nanoprobe like atomic force microscopy,

765
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:11,794
really tracing with a super fine tip over

766
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:11,794
the surface of something, or scattering X

767
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:11,794
rays, when we really think about the

768
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:11,794
moment of information transfer, we

769
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:32,815
realize like, nothing comes for free.

770
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:35,818
And I think that this question asking

771
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:35,818
framework, other than really conveniently

772
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:35,818
rederriving quantum mechanics in 1 hour

773
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:35,818
incredibly helps us understand that we

774
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:35,818
don't get to ask it for free in terms of

775
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:44,827
time.

776
00:33:45,828 --> 00:33:46,829
We don't get to ask.

777
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:47,830
It for free in terms of energy.

778
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:51,834
And we don't get to ask free floating

779
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:51,834
questions where the question and or

780
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:51,834
agentic responder are not involved

781
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:59,842
already in a semantics.

782
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:03,840
So I think it's calling attention to the

783
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:03,840
components of an experiment or a question

784
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,846
or an opening.

785
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:14,851
But agree that it's not always as simple

786
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:14,851
as a binary question, but in the special

787
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:22,859
simple basal case, it does start there.

788
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:28,865
Do you want to look at any of the

789
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:28,865
participant submitted questions, if there

790
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:28,865
was any that struck your let me finish

791
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:35,871
real quick.

792
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:37,874
Ander: I had like maybe five minutes to

793
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:38,875
wrap this up.

794
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:41,878
And this, I think, is going to, at least

795
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:43,880
in part, answer one of Dean's concerns.

796
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:46,883
So the next thing we should very briefly

797
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
cover, let's talk a little bit about

798
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:50,887
Holographic screens.

799
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:53,890
And also this is the paper on the

800
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:53,890
physical meaning of Holographic principle.

801
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,894
.

802
00:34:57,894 --> 00:35:00,891
So let's take a look at also this picture

803
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:01,892
from that paper.

804
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,895
This is the Holographic boundary and

805
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:04,895
Landauer's principle and all these

806
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:04,895
thermodynamic constraints on information

807
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:04,895
processing necessitate the breakdown of

808
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:04,895
this boundary in terms of free energy

809
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:04,895
extraction sectors, memory sectors and so

810
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:20,911
on.

811
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,913
And by the way, if you read the

812
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:22,913
paragraphs around this picture, there's

813
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:22,913
more details on how the time QRF is

814
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:22,913
induced, but we'll leave that as it is

815
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:31,922
for now.

816
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,927
Dean, what I meant by this answering your

817
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
concern, was that you don't see how Alice

818
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:43,934
can take off her eyes from the picture.

819
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,937
But that's precisely what's going on here,

820
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:46,937
, right?

821
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,940
There's a sector that's being observed,

822
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:49,940
which is a subset of these qubits that

823
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:49,940
are being observed, but presumably she

824
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:49,940
has the freedom to say, hey, this sector.

825
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:57,948
.

826
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:00,945
Now I declare as my observation sector,

827
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:00,945
this I declare as my memory sector, this

828
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:00,945
I declare as my thermal free energy

829
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:07,952
extraction sector.

830
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:11,956
So it is because of these fundamental

831
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:11,956
limits on the amount of information

832
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:11,956
processing, it is not true that she can

833
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:11,956
she doesn't have an idealized Laplacian,

834
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:11,956
if you wish, access to all the degrees of

835
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:26,971
freedom.

836
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:30,974
She can only observe, finally, a finite

837
00:36:30,974 --> 00:36:31,976
amount of stuff.

838
00:36:31,976 --> 00:36:34,979
So she is forced to take her eyes off at

839
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:34,979
least part of the system, at least for a

840
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:37,982
while, right?

841
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:40,985
Because otherwise all those energy and

842
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:40,985
time constraints that Daniel was just

843
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:40,985
mentioning, they're not you have to abide

844
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:46,991
by those.

845
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:52,997
A few things that Chris mentioned in the

846
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:52,997
last lecture when it came to this

847
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:52,997
holographic screen is, well, number one,

848
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:52,997
that all the information exchange is

849
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:52,997
mediated by bits here at the qubits, at

850
00:36:52,997 --> 00:37:07,006
this holographic screen.

851
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:12,011
This in turn enforces a finiteness in the

852
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:15,014
information transfer, if you wish.

853
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:18,017
There is not an infinite amount of

854
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:20,019
information in finite space.

855
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:24,023
Even if you were to pack it at Plankian

856
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:24,023
density, which is presumably the limit

857
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:24,023
that black holes achieve, it's still a

858
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:24,023
finite amount of information in a finite

859
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:24,023
amount of so if you have finite ones, you

860
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:44,043
are taking the other is the following.

861
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:48,047
And again, Chris will deal with this at

862
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:48,047
greater detail in perhaps lecture five, I

863
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:52,051
think maybe four.

864
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:55,054
But it's the notion of emergent spacetime,

865
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:57,056
, which is that A and B separately.

866
00:37:57,056 --> 00:38:00,053
So you think of these are presumably the

867
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
internal degrees of freedom, what's going

868
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
on inside of a alice, at an abstract

869
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
level, there may not be a notion of space,

870
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
, but notion of space emerges at the

871
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:13,066
boundary.

872
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:18,071
And that's not easy to explain, I think,

873
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:18,071
presumably has to do with and stuff like

874
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:23,076
that.

875
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:27,080
And I don't know the full details myself,

876
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
but for now, that's one of the key things

877
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
that Chris mentioned, which is that an

878
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
agent may not have space, but it may

879
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:37,090
emerge boundary.

880
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:45,098
The last thing, and I'm glad that to see

881
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:45,098
that this was mentioned already, so it

882
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:48,101
saves us time.

883
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:49,102
I don't have to say it again.

884
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:51,104
Take us a minute.

885
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:56,109
And this again answers your can you.

886
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:58,111
Daniel: Just turn off your video under

887
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:00,107
just so you don't have lag?

888
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:01,108
Ander: Yeah.

889
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:01,108
Thank you.

890
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:02,109
1 second.

891
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:07,114
Yes.

892
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:09,116
Can you yeah me.

893
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:10,117
Go for it.

894
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:15,122
This notion of Feyman diagrams, right?

895
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:18,125
So what is this whole thing about unitary

896
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:21,128
evolution or preparation?

897
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:26,133
The scattering picture as Alice preparing

898
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:26,133
as her of her boundary and writing it

899
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:26,133
into her memory and then measuring it at

900
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:26,133
some point in the future requires that

901
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:26,133
you consider the possible that happened

902
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:41,148
to that preparation.

903
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:41,148
Okay.

904
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:44,151
So if there's some amount of time passes,

905
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:44,151
you prepared your state at time T, you

906
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:44,151
look at it again at time T plus DT, you

907
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:53,160
have to take into account all.

908
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,163
The possible histories, clearly, of the

909
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:56,163
system, or at least that part of the

910
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:59,166
system.

911
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:01,162
Writing it's, just saying, I prepared it

912
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
here, now it's up to b what happens until

913
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
the next time I look at it, up to the

914
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:07,168
environment.

915
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:10,171
So in that unitary evolution, I consider

916
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:12,173
all the possibilities.

917
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:22,183
Right, and that's exactly so.

918
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:24,185
Let's just look at the conclusion.

919
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:28,189
We will leave it there for now.

920
00:40:28,189 --> 00:40:30,191
We can open up the discussion.

921
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:34,195
So there's two things that are now, where

922
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:35,196
was this?

923
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,201
Go ahead.

924
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:44,205
Dean: Yeah, I understand.

925
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:45,206
Or I think I understand.

926
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:49,210
I think I understand that if I'm looking

927
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,210
at on or if I'm attending to on, I'm not

928
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:54,215
looking at off.

929
00:40:55,215 --> 00:40:58,219
What I saw in that wave thing with

930
00:40:58,219 --> 00:40:58,219
Federman was I could also be looking at

931
00:40:58,219 --> 00:40:58,219
the switch where the two different places

932
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:08,223
of on and off exist.

933
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:12,227
And when I'm looking at the entire switch,

934
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:12,227
, I'm not looking at one or the other, I'

935
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:12,227
'm looking at that basil, as Daniel

936
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:12,227
described, that Basil opportunity of both.

937
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:22,237
.

938
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:26,241
And I think that on that I don't know how

939
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:26,241
that ties in with reference frames, but

940
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:26,241
on that level that says, I'm now looking

941
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:35,250
at all possible in that moment.

942
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,253
I don't think, at least from that

943
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:38,253
perspective, that reference frame I'm

944
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:38,253
zooming into an on or off binary choice

945
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:46,261
decision branch.

946
00:41:46,261 --> 00:41:49,264
I'm still at that place where the

947
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:52,267
preparation allows for both.

948
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:56,271
I'm literally not taking my eyes off at

949
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:57,272
that place.

950
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:59,274
So, again, I'm not arguing with you

951
00:41:59,274 --> 00:41:59,274
because what you described and the image

952
00:41:59,274 --> 00:41:59,274
that you brought up, all that is is

953
00:41:59,274 --> 00:41:59,274
bringing it down to a granular level and

954
00:41:59,274 --> 00:41:59,274
saying if I'm paying attention to this, I

955
00:41:59,274 --> 00:42:12,281
can't be paying attention to that.

956
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:15,284
But if I physically, from a transfer

957
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:15,284
perspective, back up so that I can see

958
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:15,284
both possibilities at once, I don't know

959
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:25,294
that I'm taking my eye off of either.

960
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:28,297
That's the only thing that I was bringing

961
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:28,297
up.

962
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:30,299
Now, of course, Chris will probably hear

963
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
this and go, dean, you got to go and

964
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
rethink this whole thing through, which

965
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:37,306
is great because I'm here to learn.

966
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:42,311
But again, if I misspoke about what I was

967
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:42,311
trying to say, it wasn't because I don't

968
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:42,311
see those moments when I'm directing my

969
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:55,324
preparation over here.

970
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:58,327
And that's going to give me one kind of

971
00:42:58,327 --> 00:42:58,327
measurement versus if I'm taking in a

972
00:42:58,327 --> 00:42:58,327
larger time frame or larger spatial frame

973
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:07,330
or larger holographic screen.

974
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,332
Like I don't even know how to describe it

975
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:09,332
because I just don't have the words for

976
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:11,334
it yet.

977
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:13,336
But there you go.

978
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:15,338
I just want to be clear that I'm not I

979
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:16,339
don't think I'm confused.

980
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:19,342
I just want to know the difference

981
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:19,342
between when I'm looking at on or off and

982
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:25,348
when I'm looking at the entire switch.

983
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:26,349
That's all.

984
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:31,354
Daniel: I'll add one point on this slide.

985
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:31,354
.

986
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:34,357
It goes back to some of the earliest

987
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:34,357
points that Chris made about the

988
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:40,363
ontological primacy of communication.

989
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:43,366
Space and time arise from communicating

990
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:44,367
agents.

991
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:47,370
Communicating agents are not something

992
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:47,370
that we have to squeeze into an a priori

993
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:51,374
spatial temple framework.

994
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:54,377
So quantum mechanics saying here on the

995
00:43:54,377 --> 00:43:54,377
slide is about measurement, not

996
00:43:54,377 --> 00:43:58,381
mechanical motion.

997
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:01,378
So we don't need to wait around or

998
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
speculate as to how from the quote

999
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
mechanical or physical hard drive

1000
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:09,386
measurement arises or happens.

1001
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:13,390
We start with the measurement occurring

1002
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:13,390
and then different kinds of sophisticated

1003
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:13,390
agents can conceptualize of movement

1004
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:23,400
through spaces and times.

1005
00:44:24,401 --> 00:44:27,404
And this also relates to Bayesian

1006
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:27,404
mechanics as a mechanics and a physics of

1007
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:27,404
movement on information geometric spaces.

1008
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:34,411
.

1009
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:38,415
And so the physics can be projected by

1010
00:44:38,415 --> 00:44:38,415
appropriately prepared agents, but we don'

1011
00:44:38,415 --> 00:44:38,415
't necessarily need to wonder about how

1012
00:44:38,415 --> 00:44:38,415
that agent fits within a mechanical

1013
00:44:38,415 --> 00:44:49,426
setting.

1014
00:44:50,427 --> 00:44:54,430
And I guess this is where humans are with

1015
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:54,430
the I am a strange loop girdle escher

1016
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:54,430
Bach gripper and gripped mystery of being

1017
00:44:54,430 --> 00:45:04,435
able to see it multiple ways.

1018
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:14,445
Ander, do you want to go to the

1019
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:14,445
questions?

1020
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,448
Ander: Yeah, let me just say closing

1021
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,449
remarks here.

1022
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:22,453
I think what Chris is punching line of

1023
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:22,453
the paper free energy principle for

1024
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:22,453
quantum systems, which is morally

1025
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:22,453
speaking, it's similar to relaxation to

1026
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:22,453
thermodynamical equilibrium, which is

1027
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:22,453
that if you have an isolated bipartite

1028
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:22,453
quantum system, a and B are going to turn

1029
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:22,453
are going to tend towards reference frame

1030
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:48,479
alignment and therefore entanglement.

1031
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:53,484
And these two things are basically very

1032
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,486
intimately related.

1033
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:58,489
By aligning the reference frame culia amb

1034
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
will be driven towards maximal

1035
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,486
entanglement.

1036
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:08,493
So should I take a look at the questions

1037
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:10,495
and open this?

1038
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:15,500
Yeah, so so if you guys have access to

1039
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:15,500
the Q and A, there's been more questions

1040
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:15,500
in the last bringing you guys'attention

1041
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:28,513
to a few of them.

1042
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:32,517
This is where Chris links to the papers

1043
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:32,517
of Robelli, which I mentioned earlier in

1044
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:32,517
passing when we were talking about the

1045
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:32,517
preparation, measurement cycle and the

1046
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:32,517
notion of formal time or subjective time,

1047
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:32,517
if you wish, as somebody brought up this

1048
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:32,517
remark that performance and calculations

1049
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:32,517
here you can relate t time to a change in

1050
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:32,517
a change in the volume of face space, or

1051
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:32,517
more precisely, the amount of available

1052
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:32,517
states in the state space, with a log and

1053
00:46:32,517 --> 00:47:15,554
whatever with respect to the energy.

1054
00:47:16,554 --> 00:47:16,555
Right?

1055
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,563
So this restates the idea that we're

1056
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:26,565
talking about earlier, right?

1057
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:30,569
Like your intrinsic subjective time being

1058
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:30,569
this DS the eitherative thermal time

1059
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:30,569
basically speaking, that is observer

1060
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:38,577
dependent.

1061
00:47:39,577 --> 00:47:43,582
So that's a good question to take a look

1062
00:47:43,582 --> 00:47:43,582
at.

1063
00:47:48,587 --> 00:47:49,588
There's another one.

1064
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:51,590
What is meant by local free of choice?

1065
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:53,592
This is a very good answer too.

1066
00:47:53,592 --> 00:47:56,595
Local here means a Sam boundary, right?

1067
00:47:57,595 --> 00:48:01,594
Isolated systems are idealized by

1068
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:03,596
definition.

1069
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:04,597
There's always going to be an observer

1070
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:06,599
interacting with an environment.

1071
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:08,601
So an ISO purely isolated system is an

1072
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:09,602
idealization.

1073
00:48:10,602 --> 00:48:12,605
So what local free choice means here is

1074
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:14,607
exactly what we said earlier, right?

1075
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:17,610
That you get to choose the spin axis at

1076
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,612
the boundary qubits.

1077
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,623
There were some nice questions relating

1078
00:48:30,623 --> 00:48:30,623
mark of blankets to the scattering

1079
00:48:30,623 --> 00:48:33,626
picture.

1080
00:48:35,628 --> 00:48:37,630
So this one, for instance, is also worth

1081
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,631
a look.

1082
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:43,636
So somebody brought up this very good

1083
00:48:43,636 --> 00:48:46,639
point about the scattering matrix.

1084
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:49,642
Scattering matrix is by the way, let's

1085
00:48:49,642 --> 00:48:49,642
not think about it mathematically, let's

1086
00:48:49,642 --> 00:48:54,647
think about the picture, right?

1087
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:57,650
You imagine two particles that are

1088
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:57,650
interacting and far away they are free,

1089
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:00,647
right?

1090
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:02,649
They are specially separated and

1091
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,651
interacting free particles.

1092
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:07,654
And somehow at some point they come to

1093
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:08,655
interact, right?

1094
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:10,657
And then you have to write all the finite

1095
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:10,657
diagrams for all the exchange of bosons

1096
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:15,662
or whatever the interaction is.

1097
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:18,665
And that's how you would compute the

1098
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:18,665
amplitudes for the scattering process,

1099
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:20,667
right?

1100
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,669
How those two particles that were

1101
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:22,669
separated came to interact and then they

1102
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:27,674
go off to infinity again.

1103
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:32,679
Chris here brings up the point that in a

1104
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:32,679
sense, how you define a Markov blanket is

1105
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:39,686
in the opposite direction, right?

1106
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:42,689
Marko blanket in at least in the graph

1107
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:44,691
theory sense, you start with a node.

1108
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:47,694
The marker blanket is just the set of

1109
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:47,694
nodes that separate in terms of

1110
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:47,694
conditional probability, that node from

1111
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:54,701
everyone else.

1112
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:57,704
And then you can have edges which are

1113
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:57,704
going to be directly coastal network, so

1114
00:49:57,704 --> 00:50:04,705
acyclic, no cycles directed edges.

1115
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:05,706
That's how the graph looks.

1116
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,710
And you build up essentially you're

1117
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,713
taking the opposite picture, right?

1118
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:15,716
You start with a node, which in this case

1119
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
would be the interaction, and then you

1120
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
build up to infinity as opposed to in the

1121
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
scattering picture, which is like you

1122
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
start with particles not interacting at

1123
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:24,725
infinity.

1124
00:50:24,725 --> 00:50:27,728
You see how they go off to infinity again

1125
00:50:27,728 --> 00:50:27,728
and then the interaction is in the middle.

1126
00:50:27,728 --> 00:50:29,730
.

1127
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:34,735
So obviously the answer is a bit more

1128
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
precise, but it's worth taking a look at.

1129
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:37,738
.

1130
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:42,743
And this is an interesting one too, of a

1131
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:46,747
symmetrical input output bandwidth.

1132
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:48,749
So again, if you think of it as a graph,

1133
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:48,749
nothing is constraining you to say that

1134
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:48,749
you're going to have more incoming arrows

1135
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:55,756
than outcoming arrows into the boundary.

1136
00:50:55,756 --> 00:50:56,757
Right?

1137
00:50:57,758 --> 00:50:58,759
That's just the way it is.

1138
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:01,756
If you think of it, a graph, there is no

1139
00:51:01,756 --> 00:51:03,758
symmetry imposed.

1140
00:51:03,758 --> 00:51:05,760
The only natural sense of symmetry would

1141
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,761
be energy conservation.

1142
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:10,765
And that's exactly what Chris says here,

1143
00:51:10,765 --> 00:51:10,765
right, which is that, and I'm not sure

1144
00:51:10,765 --> 00:51:10,765
myself how you relate it to a

1145
00:51:10,765 --> 00:51:10,765
conservation of not quite information,

1146
00:51:10,765 --> 00:51:10,765
but I wouldn't know how to phrase it

1147
00:51:10,765 --> 00:51:24,779
myself.

1148
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:27,782
I would just take a look at the question.

1149
00:51:27,782 --> 00:51:27,782
.

1150
00:51:27,782 --> 00:51:30,785
But basically, no, there is a priority

1151
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:30,785
nothing that necessitates symmetry input

1152
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:35,790
output in mark of blankets.

1153
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:38,793
But if you are to talk about any sort of

1154
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:38,793
symmetry, the natural language would not

1155
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:38,793
be in terms of incoming versus outcome in

1156
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:38,793
arrows, but rather energy conservation,

1157
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:38,793
which we saw is a close casting of

1158
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:38,793
information transfer, right, because of

1159
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:38,793
the minimal requirements for action to

1160
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:56,811
rewrite a qubit.

1161
00:51:57,812 --> 00:52:02,811
And the last question that I would like

1162
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:02,811
to bring your guys'attention to, I mean,

1163
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:02,811
all of them are great, but we have finite

1164
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:02,811
resources and finite times on internet

1165
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:18,827
would be would be this one.

1166
00:52:19,828 --> 00:52:19,828
Okay.

1167
00:52:19,828 --> 00:52:21,830
And I'm not going to go into too much

1168
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:21,830
detail.

1169
00:52:22,831 --> 00:52:28,837
But this is again about the local wait 1

1170
00:52:28,837 --> 00:52:29,838
second.

1171
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:42,851
Turn on my camera, by the way.

1172
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:45,854
Daniel: Dino, go for it.

1173
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:53,862
And also people can see all the questions

1174
00:52:53,862 --> 00:52:56,864
on the website, right?

1175
00:52:56,864 --> 00:52:57,866
And submit their own as well.

1176
00:52:58,867 --> 00:52:59,868
Ander: Yes, for sure.

1177
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:03,866
So now I lost track of the question that

1178
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:05,868
I wanted to show you guys.

1179
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:07,870
I think it's this one over here.

1180
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:09,872
Yes, exactly.

1181
00:53:09,872 --> 00:53:10,873
This one.

1182
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:12,875
By the way, all of them are good, even

1183
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:12,875
this one, the Holographic principle, does

1184
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:12,875
it make it easier to compute any physics

1185
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:16,879
problems?

1186
00:53:16,879 --> 00:53:19,882
Well, please take a look at Chris's

1187
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:19,882
answer.

1188
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:21,884
But all I can say is that these ideas of

1189
00:53:21,884 --> 00:53:21,884
holography, I'm not an expert, I'm not a

1190
00:53:21,884 --> 00:53:21,884
condensed matter physicist, but they're

1191
00:53:21,884 --> 00:53:21,884
used all over physics nowadays, not

1192
00:53:21,884 --> 00:53:30,893
necessarily just in high energy.

1193
00:53:31,894 --> 00:53:33,896
I know that condensed matter theorists

1194
00:53:33,896 --> 00:53:34,897
use them all the time.

1195
00:53:34,897 --> 00:53:38,901
So the answer to this is an emphatic yes,

1196
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:38,901
the Holographic, at least Ada Saft is

1197
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:42,905
used all over.

1198
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:45,908
But again, I'm not a physicist myself, so

1199
00:53:45,908 --> 00:53:45,908
this is the last question I wanted to

1200
00:53:45,908 --> 00:53:50,913
bring your attention to.

1201
00:53:51,914 --> 00:53:56,919
And here Chris, this may be the one worth

1202
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
taking a look at in terms of in order to

1203
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
answer all the earlier speculations that

1204
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
we had about time internal clock, here

1205
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
somebody asks about synchrony and just

1206
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
the perception of time with respect to

1207
00:53:56,919 --> 00:54:24,940
external clocks, I suppose.

1208
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:27,944
And Chris here answers that at the end of

1209
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:27,944
the day, even if you're using an external

1210
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:27,944
clock, everything that you perceive

1211
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:27,944
outside at the end of the day has to be

1212
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:38,955
in terms of an internal clock.

1213
00:54:38,955 --> 00:54:40,957
Any information incoming, you're going to

1214
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
have to make causal sense of it, you're

1215
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:45,962
going to have to write it into a memory.

1216
00:54:45,962 --> 00:54:48,965
In terms of an internal clock, you're

1217
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
never going to be able to, so to speak,

1218
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
increase your precision of the passage of

1219
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
time by taking that external clock, even

1220
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
if you think it's more precise than

1221
00:54:48,965 --> 00:55:00,971
anything you have inside.

1222
00:55:00,971 --> 00:55:02,973
I think that's basically what his answer

1223
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:02,973
amounts to.

1224
00:55:03,974 --> 00:55:06,977
And this is morally related to all this

1225
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:06,977
frame halting problem stuff where because

1226
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:06,977
as a system, you're never going to give

1227
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:06,977
an infinitely precise I'm speaking very

1228
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:06,977
loosely here an infinitely precise

1229
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:21,992
description of yourself.

1230
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:25,996
You're never going to morally speaking

1231
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:27,998
again, that's what it amounts to.

1232
00:55:27,998 --> 00:55:30,001
You're never going to be able to outdo

1233
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:30,001
your internal clock by trying to leverage

1234
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:30,001
something external like an atomic clock,

1235
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:30,001
that even if you think it's more precise,

1236
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:30,001
at the end of the day, your own

1237
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:30,001
subjective perception of information will

1238
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:46,017
depend on internal clocks.

1239
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:55,026
So we can open up things.

1240
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:58,028
Any concluding remarks and any other

1241
00:55:58,028 --> 00:55:58,028
Alexey or Dean or anyone else who may

1242
00:55:58,028 --> 00:56:01,026
have joined?

1243
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:04,029
I don't have anything else to say at this

1244
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:05,030
point.

1245
00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:11,036
Daniel: I mean, where or when are we?

1246
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:16,041
We had session one with a real big

1247
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:19,044
historical overview.

1248
00:56:21,046 --> 00:56:23,048
Section two, we focused on the

1249
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:23,048
Measurability question, which is answered

1250
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:23,048
with a question, and we talked about some

1251
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:23,048
of the constraints of question asking,

1252
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:23,048
namely that it takes time, it takes

1253
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:23,048
energy, you have to ask it to somebody or

1254
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:23,048
something on an interface, and it has to

1255
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:44,069
have a semantic quantum reference frame.

1256
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:47,072
And this is dovetailing with a free

1257
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:47,072
energy principle, of course, because the

1258
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:47,072
free energy principle, as it says in the

1259
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:47,072
syllables, to what does the free energy

1260
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:57,082
principle apply?

1261
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:58,083
And Chris says everything.

1262
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,084
Measurable.

1263
00:56:59,084 --> 00:57:02,081
That's why it's a theory of everything

1264
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:02,081
that we choose to measure and model, not

1265
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:08,087
ontological statements about what is.

1266
00:57:08,087 --> 00:57:11,090
And then where are we heading into in

1267
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:13,092
session three?

1268
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:17,096
Have you looked ahead, Ander, or do you

1269
00:57:17,096 --> 00:57:19,098
want me to read what's in the syllabus?

1270
00:57:19,098 --> 00:57:20,099
Ander: Please do.

1271
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:23,102
Yeah, I think basically my short answer

1272
00:57:23,102 --> 00:57:23,102
to that, and possibly my full answer also,

1273
00:57:23,102 --> 00:57:23,102
, is that it's just going to take care of

1274
00:57:23,102 --> 00:57:31,110
the loose ends in this lecture two.

1275
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:34,113
So this lecture two is a warm up to the

1276
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:34,113
real thing, which we need to talk more

1277
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:34,113
seriously about reference frames in order

1278
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:34,113
to get the precise picture of this

1279
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:44,123
quantum measurement process.

1280
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:47,126
Daniel: Yeah, it says that session three

1281
00:57:47,126 --> 00:57:47,126
will introduce the idea of quantum

1282
00:57:47,126 --> 00:57:47,126
reference frames and the representation

1283
00:57:47,126 --> 00:57:54,133
using Hierarchies of binary classifiers.

1284
00:57:55,134 --> 00:57:56,135
These formal structures provide a

1285
00:57:56,135 --> 00:57:56,135
semantics for measurement and hence

1286
00:57:56,135 --> 00:57:56,135
provide the basis for a theory of meaning

1287
00:57:56,135 --> 00:58:01,134
for interacting agents.

1288
00:58:02,135 --> 00:58:03,136
The language of QRFs allows a

1289
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
particularly straightforward and

1290
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
intuitive definition of variational free

1291
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
energy, and so allows a fully general

1292
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:13,146
quantum formulation of the FEP.

1293
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:15,148
We will see that the FEP is a classical

1294
00:58:15,148 --> 00:58:15,148
limit on the principle of unitarity, the

1295
00:58:15,148 --> 00:58:21,154
fundamental principle of quantum theory.

1296
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:26,159
Ander: By the way, Danielle, I'm not sure

1297
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:26,159
if you're busy, but I just got an email

1298
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,162
from Chris.

1299
00:58:29,162 --> 00:58:32,165
I think he may be watching us and I think

1300
00:58:32,165 --> 00:58:34,167
he's just confused about the link.

1301
00:58:35,168 --> 00:58:38,171
Chris, I don't know if you're there still,

1302
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:40,173
, but do you think it's worth it?

1303
00:58:40,173 --> 00:58:42,175
We send him the link real quick if he can

1304
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:43,176
come for a few minutes.

1305
00:58:43,176 --> 00:58:44,177
Yeah.

1306
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:50,183
Daniel: I'll send Chris the zoom link now.

1307
00:58:50,183 --> 00:58:50,183
.

1308
00:58:51,183 --> 00:58:54,187
Yeah, hold on to your qubit, Chris, we're

1309
00:58:54,187 --> 00:58:55,188
coming.

1310
00:58:56,189 --> 00:58:59,192
Ander: Yeah, so let's give him a few

1311
00:58:59,192 --> 00:59:00,187
minutes.

1312
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:02,189
Maybe he's still watching and he'll

1313
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:02,189
answer the questions better than I could.

1314
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:05,192
.

1315
00:59:05,192 --> 00:59:09,196
Dean: Well, Daniel is sending him a

1316
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:10,197
lifeline.

1317
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:15,202
Just from the rookie perspective on this

1318
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
session one seemed like there was a big

1319
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
time window, like the historical piece

1320
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
over using an external clock and a

1321
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:30,217
timeline.

1322
00:59:31,218 --> 00:59:34,221
This one felt like the parabola and the

1323
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
upper down and the entanglement was

1324
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
almost instantaneous in terms of that

1325
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
plank length that we were really holding

1326
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
up as comparative to that timeline, that

1327
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:51,238
chronological timeline.

1328
00:59:52,238 --> 00:59:55,242
And so I'm guessing that now that we've

1329
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
established those two as different, where

1330
00:59:55,242 --> 01:00:01,525
does that go?

1331
01:00:01,627 --> 01:00:04,940
But again, that's just the rookies view

1332
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:05,875
of things.

1333
01:00:11,229 --> 01:00:12,326
Daniel: Hey, Chris.

1334
01:00:12,336 --> 01:00:13,400
Welcome.

1335
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:14,566
Chris: Yeah, hi.

1336
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:18,988
This is a very interesting discussion and

1337
01:00:18,988 --> 01:00:18,988
it's given me some pointers as to what to

1338
01:00:18,988 --> 01:00:18,988
emphasize at the beginning of session

1339
01:00:18,988 --> 01:00:27,873
three.

1340
01:00:28,966 --> 01:00:31,293
But I can say in response to Dean's

1341
01:00:31,293 --> 01:00:31,293
question that the time when Alice isn't

1342
01:00:31,293 --> 01:00:31,293
looking is the time during which Bob is

1343
01:00:31,293 --> 01:00:31,293
making his measurement and then his next

1344
01:00:31,293 --> 01:00:44,593
preparation step.

1345
01:00:45,686 --> 01:00:50,146
So if you consider again that slide that

1346
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:50,146
shows sort of the Feynman representation

1347
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:50,146
of what's happening as this unitary flow,

1348
01:00:50,146 --> 01:01:03,804
that's what Bob is doing.

1349
01:01:03,811 --> 01:01:06,181
And I think Ander said that from Alice's

1350
01:01:06,181 --> 01:01:06,181
point of view, bob is just some quantum

1351
01:01:06,181 --> 01:01:06,181
system and she's banged on that system by

1352
01:01:06,181 --> 01:01:16,114
asking a question.

1353
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:21,603
And now that system is doing something or

1354
01:01:21,603 --> 01:01:21,603
other that she can't see until Bob bangs

1355
01:01:21,603 --> 01:01:21,603
on his side of the screen and she gets

1356
01:01:21,603 --> 01:01:30,569
some information.

1357
01:01:30,582 --> 01:01:35,049
By making a measurement, she may be not

1358
01:01:35,049 --> 01:01:40,540
looking for a very short period of time.

1359
01:01:41,688 --> 01:01:42,758
Right.

1360
01:01:42,773 --> 01:01:45,003
According to her internal clock.

1361
01:01:45,006 --> 01:01:48,031
She's not looking for just the time it

1362
01:01:48,031 --> 01:01:48,031
takes for one of her internal ticks to

1363
01:01:48,031 --> 01:01:51,066
take place.

1364
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:58,130
But in general, we're not saying anything

1365
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:02,114
about how long that time is, right?

1366
01:02:02,115 --> 01:02:05,145
If you think of this in a scattering

1367
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:05,145
theory way, then we're talking about the

1368
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:05,145
time between two protons leaving the

1369
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:05,145
rings on the Large Hadron Collider to the

1370
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:05,145
time that all the stuff that comes out of

1371
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:05,145
their collision is measured by the

1372
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:05,145
detectors, which is a nanosecond or

1373
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:05,145
something like that, some very short

1374
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:29,387
period of time.

1375
01:02:32,418 --> 01:02:37,467
So just think of that interval as the

1376
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:37,467
measure of the intrinsic time dependence,

1377
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:37,467
external time dependence of the

1378
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:49,583
interaction.

1379
01:02:49,586 --> 01:02:51,603
Someone has to do something and then

1380
01:02:51,603 --> 01:02:52,619
someone else has to do something.

1381
01:02:53,619 --> 01:02:56,653
And there's a gap between what the first

1382
01:02:56,653 --> 01:02:56,653
person does and what they see in response.

1383
01:02:56,653 --> 01:03:00,630
.

1384
01:03:01,648 --> 01:03:05,682
Let's see what's the other question the

1385
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:05,682
other central question that came up today

1386
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:05,682
was the question of why observing

1387
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:14,772
something requires action.

1388
01:03:14,778 --> 01:03:17,801
And of course, in the classical picture,

1389
01:03:17,801 --> 01:03:17,801
observing something doesn't require any

1390
01:03:17,801 --> 01:03:20,832
action at all.

1391
01:03:22,852 --> 01:03:23,869
The event just happens.

1392
01:03:24,878 --> 01:03:28,913
And this is the fundamental, if you will,

1393
01:03:28,913 --> 01:03:28,913
distinction between classical and quantum

1394
01:03:28,913 --> 01:03:28,913
theory is that making an observation in

1395
01:03:28,913 --> 01:03:28,913
quantum theory is taking an action on the

1396
01:03:28,913 --> 01:03:39,026
world.

1397
01:03:40,035 --> 01:03:43,068
And there's a lovely metaphor that's not

1398
01:03:43,068 --> 01:03:43,068
correct in detail but it's very useful, I

1399
01:03:43,068 --> 01:03:43,068
think, conceptually which heisenberg came

1400
01:03:43,068 --> 01:03:43,068
up with to try to explain his uncertainty

1401
01:03:43,068 --> 01:03:57,202
principle to his classical colleagues.

1402
01:03:57,209 --> 01:04:01,182
He said, look, suppose I'm trying to see

1403
01:04:01,182 --> 01:04:01,182
a very small particle and measure its

1404
01:04:01,182 --> 01:04:05,220
motion.

1405
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,273
I have to have a microscope to see this

1406
01:04:10,273 --> 01:04:13,303
particle and to measure its motion.

1407
01:04:13,304 --> 01:04:14,319
I need to light it up.

1408
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,336
I need to shine some light on it.

1409
01:04:16,337 --> 01:04:19,367
And those photons of light are actually

1410
01:04:19,367 --> 01:04:22,397
impacting the thing I'm trying to see.

1411
01:04:23,407 --> 01:04:27,447
So the act of observation itself requires

1412
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:31,479
banging something into an object.

1413
01:04:32,495 --> 01:04:36,529
And when we're just looking out at the

1414
01:04:36,529 --> 01:04:36,529
world, it's the sun that's banging the

1415
01:04:36,529 --> 01:04:42,592
light into the object, not us.

1416
01:04:42,596 --> 01:04:45,621
But we can sort of merge those two

1417
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:45,621
systems together because it's the sun

1418
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:45,621
that's taking the action that lets us get

1419
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:52,692
some information.

1420
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,728
But the sun is perturbing the things that

1421
01:04:55,728 --> 01:04:55,728
we're looking at by banging photons into

1422
01:04:55,728 --> 01:04:59,761
them.

1423
01:05:01,722 --> 01:05:04,755
And I think that picture of Heisenberg's

1424
01:05:04,755 --> 01:05:04,755
is what he used to actually derive the

1425
01:05:04,755 --> 01:05:04,755
uncertainty principle in terms of

1426
01:05:04,755 --> 01:05:04,755
momentum and position, because banging

1427
01:05:04,755 --> 01:05:04,755
something into something is transferring

1428
01:05:04,755 --> 01:05:18,898
momentum to it.

1429
01:05:18,898 --> 01:05:21,924
Photons transfers the momentum to the

1430
01:05:21,924 --> 01:05:21,924
tiny particle in the microscope, and that

1431
01:05:21,924 --> 01:05:21,924
perturbs its position on the microscope

1432
01:05:21,924 --> 01:05:21,924
stage, which is precisely what heisenberg

1433
01:05:21,924 --> 01:05:31,026
is trying to measure.

1434
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:35,069
So that's his point in that analogy.

1435
01:05:36,075 --> 01:05:40,111
Observation itself always takes action.

1436
01:05:40,112 --> 01:05:42,132
And that's why observation and

1437
01:05:42,132 --> 01:05:42,132
preparation are duals in quantum theory,

1438
01:05:42,132 --> 01:05:42,132
because they each require a minimum one

1439
01:05:42,132 --> 01:05:48,194
unit of action.

1440
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:51,221
And I think, Ander, you said the duality

1441
01:05:51,221 --> 01:05:51,221
can be thought of in terms of time

1442
01:05:51,221 --> 01:05:56,270
invariance, and that's exactly correct.

1443
01:05:56,278 --> 01:05:59,303
Preparation is just measurement run

1444
01:05:59,303 --> 01:06:01,263
backwards and vice versa.

1445
01:06:01,264 --> 01:06:04,292
Ander: And if you let me say a few words,

1446
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:04,292
I think this also answers my own

1447
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:04,292
confusion and the one that Alexey the

1448
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:04,292
question that Alexi posed earlier, which

1449
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:04,292
is this duality between preparation and

1450
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:04,292
measurement in your picture that you're

1451
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:04,292
bringing up Chris with heisenberg by

1452
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:04,292
shining photons on particle that I'm

1453
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:23,483
trying to observe.

1454
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,518
These pictures of preparation and

1455
01:06:26,518 --> 01:06:26,518
measurement are dual because in doing so,

1456
01:06:26,518 --> 01:06:30,558
I'm constraining the system.

1457
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,579
In trying to measure it, I'm constraining

1458
01:06:33,579 --> 01:06:33,581
it.

1459
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,625
In me trying to gather information by

1460
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:39,640
shining photons on it.

1461
01:06:39,641 --> 01:06:41,665
What I'm really doing is I'm constraining

1462
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:41,668
it.

1463
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:46,711
I'm just saying you can only take this

1464
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,733
moment or position.

1465
01:06:48,735 --> 01:06:49,746
Would that be correct?

1466
01:06:52,772 --> 01:06:52,777
Chris: Yeah.

1467
01:06:52,778 --> 01:06:55,806
In fact, in the microscope example, it's

1468
01:06:55,806 --> 01:06:55,806
particularly clear you're bouncing a

1469
01:06:55,806 --> 01:06:55,806
photon off of the object, and then it's

1470
01:06:55,806 --> 01:07:03,827
that photon that you're detecting.

1471
01:07:05,844 --> 01:07:06,851
Right.

1472
01:07:06,859 --> 01:07:10,891
There was one other question that can be

1473
01:07:10,891 --> 01:07:11,906
answered quickly.

1474
01:07:11,907 --> 01:07:15,942
It was the question about what's the

1475
01:07:15,942 --> 01:07:15,942
reference frame that Alice is using when

1476
01:07:15,942 --> 01:07:15,942
she's measuring up or down, measuring her

1477
01:07:15,942 --> 01:07:25,041
spin up or down.

1478
01:07:25,043 --> 01:07:28,076
And of course, there are several

1479
01:07:28,076 --> 01:07:28,076
reference frames involved here, so let's

1480
01:07:28,076 --> 01:07:36,152
work inwards in a real system.

1481
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:37,165
Alice is sitting here.

1482
01:07:37,165 --> 01:07:40,192
She's got a Stern Girlock apparatus,

1483
01:07:40,192 --> 01:07:40,192
which is a vertical magnet apparatus, and

1484
01:07:40,192 --> 01:07:40,192
she's measuring the spin of an electron

1485
01:07:40,192 --> 01:07:40,192
that's traveling through this Stern

1486
01:07:40,192 --> 01:07:50,290
Girlock device.

1487
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:53,325
And what the Stern Girlock device does is

1488
01:07:53,325 --> 01:07:53,325
orient the spin with a magnetic field

1489
01:07:53,325 --> 01:07:53,325
that's not homogeneous, so it ends up

1490
01:07:53,325 --> 01:07:53,325
pointing physically up as it comes

1491
01:07:53,325 --> 01:08:04,375
through the apparatus.

1492
01:08:05,385 --> 01:08:09,426
So how is that apparatus oriented?

1493
01:08:09,426 --> 01:08:12,452
I mean, what defines the up direction for

1494
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:13,462
that apparatus?

1495
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:16,493
Well, in the practical setting, what

1496
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:16,493
defines that apparatus orientation is the

1497
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:21,548
Earth's gravitational field.

1498
01:08:22,553 --> 01:08:23,560
Right.

1499
01:08:23,565 --> 01:08:25,585
We're here in the laboratory, and the

1500
01:08:25,585 --> 01:08:25,585
Earth's gravitational field tells us what

1501
01:08:25,585 --> 01:08:29,620
direction is down.

1502
01:08:29,621 --> 01:08:31,646
It's toward the center of the Earth, and

1503
01:08:31,646 --> 01:08:31,646
so up is away from the center of the

1504
01:08:31,646 --> 01:08:31,646
Earth, and that's what defines the axis

1505
01:08:31,646 --> 01:08:31,646
for the apparatus, which is a great big

1506
01:08:31,646 --> 01:08:39,729
piece of metal.

1507
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:42,751
So it's very responsive to the

1508
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:43,766
gravitational field.

1509
01:08:44,775 --> 01:08:47,801
So now we can ask about Alice.

1510
01:08:47,802 --> 01:08:47,804
Right.

1511
01:08:47,805 --> 01:08:50,830
Alice is also embedded in this

1512
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:50,830
gravitational field, and she also can

1513
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:55,888
detect the gravitational field.

1514
01:08:55,889 --> 01:08:59,921
She can tell which way is down toward the

1515
01:08:59,921 --> 01:08:59,921
center of the Earth by the force acting

1516
01:08:59,921 --> 01:09:03,904
on her feet.

1517
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:06,939
And that measurement is taking place in

1518
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:08,952
Alice's brain.

1519
01:09:08,955 --> 01:09:11,980
So in Alice's brain, there's a

1520
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:11,980
representation of which way is up, and

1521
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:11,980
that's the internal reference frame of

1522
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:20,077
Alice that lets her do the experiment.

1523
01:09:21,086 --> 01:09:24,117
If she was freely floating in space, but

1524
01:09:24,117 --> 01:09:24,117
the apparatus was anchored to the

1525
01:09:24,117 --> 01:09:24,117
gravitational field, she wouldn't be able

1526
01:09:24,117 --> 01:09:24,117
to tell that it was anchored to the

1527
01:09:24,117 --> 01:09:35,220
gravitational field.

1528
01:09:35,221 --> 01:09:37,248
That's Einstein's point that Einstein

1529
01:09:37,248 --> 01:09:37,248
makes in all of those experiments where

1530
01:09:37,248 --> 01:09:37,248
he has observers flying around in

1531
01:09:37,248 --> 01:09:37,248
spacecraft that they have to have their

1532
01:09:37,248 --> 01:09:47,346
own reference frame.

1533
01:09:49,364 --> 01:09:52,391
What Einstein didn't emphasize was that

1534
01:09:52,391 --> 01:09:54,414
reference frame is in their head.

1535
01:09:54,418 --> 01:09:57,441
It's encoded by their nervous system.

1536
01:09:58,454 --> 01:10:02,430
So I think it was Daniel who said this

1537
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:02,430
exactly correctly, that the physical

1538
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:02,430
object in her head, the the actual neural

1539
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:02,430
network that tells her which way the

1540
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:02,430
gravitational field is, is itself a

1541
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:17,587
semantic object.

1542
01:10:18,596 --> 01:10:22,637
That's what gives the word up and down

1543
01:10:22,637 --> 01:10:24,657
meaning for Alice.

1544
01:10:25,664 --> 01:10:27,683
What do I mean when I say the word

1545
01:10:27,683 --> 01:10:27,688
meaning?

1546
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,714
I mean, it lets her take some action.

1547
01:10:32,738 --> 01:10:36,773
Semantics boils down to actionability if

1548
01:10:36,773 --> 01:10:39,800
it gives things significance.

1549
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:42,835
And this was the point that Bateson was

1550
01:10:42,835 --> 01:10:42,835
making when he said, differences that

1551
01:10:42,835 --> 01:10:42,835
make a difference for an organism,

1552
01:10:42,835 --> 01:10:42,835
something is meaningful if it actually

1553
01:10:42,835 --> 01:10:42,835
makes a difference for what I can do in

1554
01:10:42,835 --> 01:10:42,835
this world that I'm trying to survive in.

1555
01:10:42,835 --> 01:10:59,001
.

1556
01:11:00,957 --> 01:11:02,978
So I'll leave it at that.

1557
01:11:02,979 --> 01:11:06,017
But this is very useful for leading off

1558
01:11:06,017 --> 01:11:08,035
the next session.

1559
01:11:08,036 --> 01:11:11,060
So thank you very much for all that

1560
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:11,068
discussion.

1561
01:11:12,078 --> 01:11:13,085
Daniel: Awesome.

1562
01:11:13,087 --> 01:11:14,093
Thank you.

1563
01:11:14,093 --> 01:11:16,118
Ander: I guess if I could say one thing

1564
01:11:16,118 --> 01:11:16,118
here is that let me scroll back up to the

1565
01:11:16,118 --> 01:11:21,167
three points early in the slides.

1566
01:11:22,175 --> 01:11:25,203
Differences that make a difference would

1567
01:11:25,203 --> 01:11:25,203
tell you that you require action to

1568
01:11:25,203 --> 01:11:29,249
perturb a system and measure.

1569
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,270
And then the semantics or the

1570
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:32,270
contextuality that may be encoded in the

1571
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:32,270
nervous system would tell you what is the

1572
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:39,346
difference that is being made.

1573
01:11:39,347 --> 01:11:41,359
Would that be correct?

1574
01:11:41,361 --> 01:11:41,369
Chris: Yeah.

1575
01:11:42,371 --> 01:11:42,379
Right.

1576
01:11:43,381 --> 01:11:45,401
What tells you that there's a difference

1577
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:45,404
there?

1578
01:11:45,408 --> 01:11:48,432
It's what you're able to detect and

1579
01:11:48,432 --> 01:11:49,447
represent internally.

1580
01:11:49,448 --> 01:11:54,490
Daniel: It's almost like step one, do

1581
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:55,504
differently.

1582
01:11:55,506 --> 01:11:57,528
Step two, you have to ask it to a

1583
01:11:57,528 --> 01:11:59,539
different thing.

1584
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:02,517
And then three, you need the semantic

1585
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:02,517
frame that makes A and B different

1586
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:08,579
differences all the way down.

1587
01:12:10,598 --> 01:12:15,640
Well, we will transcribe this and fix the

1588
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,667
few patchy moments ender.

1589
01:12:17,668 --> 01:12:20,695
We'll work together on updating the

1590
01:12:20,695 --> 01:12:20,695
transcript so that everybody who wants to

1591
01:12:20,695 --> 01:12:20,695
be well prepared for the measurement of

1592
01:12:20,695 --> 01:12:20,695
the third lecture will be absolutely in

1593
01:12:20,695 --> 01:12:30,797
place.

1594
01:12:33,828 --> 01:12:35,841
Thank you, Chris, for joining.

1595
01:12:35,841 --> 01:12:39,881
That's a fun cap to this discussion.

1596
01:12:39,882 --> 01:12:41,902
Chris: So, all right, thank you.

1597
01:12:41,903 --> 01:12:42,914
Daniel: See you all next time.

1598
01:12:42,915 --> 01:12:42,917
Ander: Bye.
