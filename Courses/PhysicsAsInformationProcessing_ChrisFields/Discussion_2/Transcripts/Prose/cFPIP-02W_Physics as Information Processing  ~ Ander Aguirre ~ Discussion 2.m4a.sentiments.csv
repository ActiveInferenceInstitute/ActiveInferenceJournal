4280	4830	A	0.546256959438324	You.
6480	7230	B	0.5208580493927002	Hello.
7600	10524	C	0.8491161465644836	It's July 1, 2023.
10642	14840	C	0.9193466305732727	We're in Physics as Information processing in the second discussion.
15000	18732	C	0.9398062229156494	So thanks all for joining, and we'll see who else comes in.
18786	25288	C	0.7373888492584229	If you're watching Live, feel free to write questions in the Live chat and I'll relay them onwards.
25464	26584	C	0.742271900177002	So andre.
26712	27244	C	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
27362	33750	C	0.9248993992805481	And it would be awesome to begin with a little bit of some overview and some points that you wanted to get to.
34840	35204	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
35242	36340	A	0.8880262970924377	Thank you, Daniel.
37000	38420	A	0.8846725225448608	So, good morning, everyone.
38570	47290	A	0.9037465453147888	So if you would start what Chris spoke about last time.
49180	51610	A	0.8466819524765015	I have a few slides that I singled out.
52940	66620	A	0.8849973678588867	So now we're getting to reformulation of quantum theory in terms of reformulation of opposed to dynamical theory.
67540	76720	A	0.8713921308517456	And as we've talked in previous sessions, we need to think a little bit philosophically about what the ontology of measurement entails.
77940	82580	A	0.9348869919776917	So Chris last lecture started with these three basic ingredients.
84920	91524	A	0.8546887636184692	So an action that's, number one, a thing to ask about.
91722	98410	A	0.874176025390625	This is the qubit, the physical degrees of freedom that we need to perturb in some way to ask a question.
98780	106380	A	0.6110124588012695	And then finally, a semantics, a language that makes sense, a context that makes sense of that information that we gather.
108960	118928	A	0.5824306011199951	So I should say, number one, I came up in the first question when I can't exactly remember.
119014	122210	A	0.8736604452133179	But at some point, we talked about what is information?
122820	129956	A	0.8844242095947266	And we came up with or we brought up a definition that goes something like this.
129978	130784	A	0.9133824706077576	It's a nice adash.
130832	133828	A	0.6827216744422913	It's differences that make a difference.
133914	144136	A	0.6413184404373169	This is chris told me I can't remember who first coined this dash, but I think it's quite old, at least early 70s.
144238	148616	A	0.8463721871376038	Anyway, so number one, basically curve that part, right?
148718	152596	A	0.8074345588684082	If I want to gather some information, I need to perturb a system somehow.
152628	153844	A	0.7634881734848022	So I need to act.
153982	157580	A	0.7411523461341858	And this is literally in units of actions, right?
157650	159916	A	0.7435704469680786	So units of energy times time.
160018	169260	A	0.7043647766113281	And he provided the example of rodoxin, which is apparently near optimal from a quantum perspective.
169340	173936	A	0.8157157897949219	This is mechanically what goes on in your eyes as light comes in.
174118	177920	A	0.6776215434074402	And this is clearly the difference that makes a difference in your brain.
180360	182992	A	0.8638274669647217	The second part were the physical degrees of freedom.
183056	188836	A	0.8368164300918579	So recall that we had a boundary, okay?
188938	219310	A	0.6127236485481262	So this theory of quantum mechanics as measurement necessarily breaks down the system into a bipartite system with a boundary, which are a lot smaller than the degrees of freedom of A and B, at least in terms of the dimension of the filbert space and media change.
220580	222560	C	0.4923841059207916	Sorry, can you repeat, Andre?
223540	224304	A	0.5405454039573669	Repeat what?
224342	226400	C	0.5468348264694214	Sorry, just last 30 seconds.
226900	227456	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
227558	248010	A	0.8812381029129028	So the second ingredient is the physical medium in which this information exchange occurs, where the physical degrees of freedom, the qubits, are arranged, and these are physically perturbed in order to mediate that difference that makes a difference.
248940	253880	A	0.8716105818748474	So we can think of this dually as either preparing those qubits or decoding those qubits.
255040	261820	A	0.8315423727035522	And then finally, there was the notion of the reference frame.
262320	270524	A	0.8535758256912231	Okay, so the theory necessitates a free choice of the agent of a reference frame.
270572	280096	A	0.8628364205360413	And physically what this amounts to is a free choice of a measurement axis for those qubits.
280128	285408	A	0.8969417214393616	So we can think of measuring z spin in those qubits on the boundary.
285504	290500	A	0.8633711934089661	So that requires a free choice of that axis.
291500	298228	A	0.8807604312896729	And this amounts to your reference frame, the context in which those measurements are performed.
298404	308140	A	0.6886904835700989	On one extreme case, we have that if those references are perfectly aligned, then the exchange of information is noiseless.
308640	308956	A	0.5509712100028992	There.
308978	310524	A	0.895462155342102	Was it somewhere over here?
310562	313240	A	0.658047080039978	I think I can't quite recall.
313320	319344	A	0.6555634140968323	But generically, these two reference frames of Alice and Bob, A and B are not exactly the same.
319462	321772	A	0.7731711864471436	They get to choose the reference frames.
321836	324848	A	0.7349846959114075	I think it's all the way on the bottom, actually.
325014	326988	A	0.7165521383285522	Right, so they can be aligned.
327004	330164	A	0.7152297496795654	If they're aligned, they are exchanging noiseless information.
330282	330708	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
330794	338900	A	0.7251882553100586	There is no randomness if they are not superposition onto.
339720	343684	A	0.6860658526420593	And that's when you're going to get probabilities in the outcomes.
343812	345240	A	0.8151816725730896	Trivial probabilities.
346140	347450	A	0.966352105140686	So far, so good.
349260	349864	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
349982	356108	A	0.853191614151001	Okay, so I have a few more comments of the main things.
356274	357084	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
357282	360780	A	0.7020310163497925	It'll take me a few minutes and then we can chat back and forth.
361520	368768	A	0.9064615368843079	Perhaps this slide is interesting, important.
368854	377584	A	0.48630788922309875	I remember this is where I asked the question myself, because it's not easy to wrap your head around what's going on here.
377782	382020	A	0.8605222105979919	So we said that measurement and preparation are completely dual pictures.
383080	387056	A	0.8351449966430664	So this is going to be expanded on in the next lecture.
387248	402920	A	0.8033311367034912	But a jerk corollary of that is that if you prepare chris said it in similar terms, if you prepare something in a certain state and then you measure it right away, you should expect that it's still in that state, right?
403070	413310	A	0.8394351601600647	So, intuitively speaking, this induces a cycle, right, where you have preparation and measurement and you're back to square one, so to speak.
414560	424990	A	0.8142105937004089	And in generating that cycle, obviously there has to be some notion of time, right?
426160	435156	A	0.831964373588562	So that's where we're going to have to make sense of the distinction between internal and external time.
435258	444936	A	0.8141863942146301	If we take this measurement operator and here perform some operations, we can write it as a unitary propagator from quantum mechanics, which again preserves information.
445038	446970	A	0.6966097354888916	It just leaves the state as it is.
448460	456392	A	0.8811270594596863	But with this little trick of the week rotation, you can write it as e to the measurement up to a constant.
456536	469490	A	0.7356128096580505	And that precisely encodes, at least morally speaking, what we just said, right, that this preparation measurement thing is a cycle, and more importantly, it gets rid of this t external time.
470820	478572	A	0.7070332169532776	And presumably in here it's going to be replaced by some notion of internal time.
478726	487380	A	0.8838067650794983	We're going to have an internal time QRF, that is the true local time, as the observer perceives.
488520	501770	A	0.8417105078697205	I'm not entirely certain of the details, but now, looking at it, here the beta, which presumably there's beta and inverse temperature here.
502220	506364	A	0.8708568811416626	I think this is going to be intimately related to notions of thermal time.
506482	519710	A	0.8908172845840454	This has been explored in papers by Rovelli called Internal Tank Revs and Thermal Time is the way in which the observer observes the passage of time.
521120	524432	A	0.9193264245986938	Those papers of Rovelli are linked in the Q and A by the way.
524486	527010	A	0.7639708518981934	So I can also provide links later.
530020	531696	A	0.7864832878112793	I think there might have been a question.
531798	532796	A	0.8057287335395813	Should I stop?
532838	533664	C	0.7568445205688477	Yeah, Dean.
533712	534710	C	0.4859412908554077	Go for it.
535800	552200	B	0.8122221231460571	I was curious about this because what I heard Chris start this session with was that he was going to try to help us understand when we are looking at something through a mechanical lens.
552540	576524	B	0.8669599890708923	So quantum mechanics and to me this slide was the way of addressing, as he said his words were characterized information transfer in a quantum theoretic way that the translation from H to M took the mechanics aspect out of the change or timepiece.
576572	589860	B	0.8587237000465393	It was the purification, the most theoretical form of transfer of information as opposed to holding up just the one ordered or sequenced or mechanical lens.
591160	599704	B	0.5232241153717041	I heard you ask the question and I kind of smiled because I thought to myself no, I understand why Anders is asking this question.
599902	611196	B	0.8568126559257507	It's can something be both gripper in the conceptual meaning sense ontologically and gripped a physical object.
611298	614712	B	0.5022632479667664	And I think what I thought maybe I was misinterpreting.
614776	618128	B	0.5533578991889954	I'd like what your perspective on this is.
618294	626940	B	0.6802021265029907	That ability to go from H to M is what allows us to have both the mechanical and the theoretical.
627020	634532	B	0.6139346361160278	The transference in its purest sense is that being able to have both can be true.
634666	637300	B	0.7994291186332703	Is that what it is?
637370	638710	A	0.5923560261726379	Yes, for sure.
641900	642650	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
647120	649950	A	0.8267481923103333	Much else to say here.
652320	661068	A	0.6137990951538086	It is true that you can think of the information transfer picture as an enlargement or an addition to the mechanical picture.
661244	666770	A	0.7288560271263123	And that I don't think that the mechanical picture has to be just thrown out completely.
667380	675232	A	0.715136706829071	I think it's interesting to keep it to see how it can be recovered from the information processing picture.
675376	681904	A	0.729023277759552	This reminds me actually there is an Italian physicist, I think his name is Kiribella.
681952	692512	A	0.6607304811477661	And Dean, if you want, I can link you the papers later who is very fond of the information theoretical approach to quantum mechanics and deducing quantum mechanics from first principles.
692676	718500	A	0.7759519815444946	And he has a paper, I think the title is Physics without Physics or something like that, where he treats this whole thing as a big seller automaton and by taking appropriate scaling limits he derives QFT non interacting QFT.
718920	727700	A	0.8808625936508179	So he says, okay, let me start with some axioms how information should be information processing.
729880	731928	A	0.6027386784553528	I mean, I'm very loose here.
732014	741130	A	0.88688725233078	Then get a cellular automaton out of this and then take scaling and recover QFT, non interacting QFT at least.
741660	748190	A	0.8780994415283203	So start with a few axioms about information processing, recover mechanics from that.
749440	751630	A	0.8780232667922974	Does that add to your question a little bit?
752080	752830	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
754720	759104	B	0.8716307282447815	All I'm trying to do is tie this back into some of the live streams that we've done in the past.
759142	761500	B	0.730012059211731	And I know I use different language.
761660	769092	B	0.549796462059021	I am not a scientist and I've not studied quantum other than sort of in passing ways.
769146	787064	B	0.6806562542915344	But I do think that what this spoke to me about was something that I've always tried to include, which is that there's the figure it out piece, which to me is the conceptual and the meaning part that Chris talked about very clearly here.
787182	789320	B	0.8127171397209167	And then there's the outing of the figure.
789390	807264	B	0.6302226185798645	There's this sort of physical edge and boundary that if you don't have an awareness of both things happening concurrently the preparation and the measure are a unitary of sort of minimum of two state then all bets are off.
807302	820404	B	0.6851953268051147	In terms of being able to think of these propagators and operators and all of the ways that we're trying to explain the situation they're off.
820522	822710	B	0.7222644686698914	So we have to have both.
823240	830332	B	0.830174446105957	We have to have that sense that there is a transfer and there is the mechanics.
830496	833160	B	0.7637720108032227	We have to keep both juggling all the time.
833310	843272	B	0.6581447720527649	So that's where this one particular slide was really quite both bias confirming for me.
843406	848856	B	0.5098304152488708	But I think it also, as you say, is going to open up a lot that July.
849048	850108	A	0.5375386476516724	Yeah, I agree.
850194	855260	A	0.8315445184707642	I think this might be the most important or mysterious situation slide.
856020	856336	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
856358	866492	B	0.8479259610176086	And it turns the pyramid, the conventional approach here's a pyramid into a top that can be spun essentially with a rick rotation.
866636	874032	B	0.5489583015441895	And it validates how information transfer probably gets short shrift in most of this quantum conversation.
874096	880808	B	0.6981381773948669	But it's probably at least an equal to the mechanical part.
880974	884250	B	0.901599109172821	What order are we delivering this information in?
885580	886344	B	0.7882161736488342	At that point?
886382	887000	B	0.5127782821655273	I'll stop.
887070	887690	B	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
891820	893000	C	0.6003725528717041	Alexey.
894400	895884	D	0.8375380039215088	Hi, can you hear me?
896002	896670	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
901200	905376	D	0.4691220223903656	My mathematics teacher in high school used to say this is beautiful, but I don't quite understand it.
905398	910544	D	0.7514679431915283	So I wanted to maybe I have two questions, but I'll start with this simpler one.
910582	920160	D	0.8494306206703186	So when Chris talked about the reference frame and said common language, I think in Shannon common language is the alphabet.
920240	923716	D	0.8957240581512451	There's a receiver and Sandra and the alphabet that they share.
923898	930156	D	0.7964368462562561	And then Chris said this reference frame is a physical thing like neurons or hands or mouth.
930208	942960	D	0.5081102252006531	And then I got lost because if when I encode I modify something on the hard drive, then the physical components of the hard drive is the reference frame.
943060	946300	D	0.5958060026168823	But this is not the shared language.
946720	948812	D	0.7798084020614624	So that's my first question.
948866	950190	D	0.7678356170654297	Maybe I'll stop here.
951120	961440	D	0.8329823017120361	I understand we're dealing in metaphors, but I want to understand that the reference frame up or down, if Bob and Alice understand it similarly, then is that really physical?
961780	968064	A	0.8174715042114258	I think answer is that Chris would.
968102	969884	C	0.6021651029586792	Probably give a better answer from beginning.
969932	975952	A	0.5922712087631226	Audrey Go is that both are true at the same time.
976006	978448	A	0.6770935654640198	I think Chris would give you a better answer.
978534	991220	A	0.721369743347168	But the semantics or sorry, the sherling, which a reference frame has to have physical embodiment and that's a piece of hardware.
991300	992810	A	0.7965182065963745	It's a neuron or something.
993660	1001096	A	0.8466326594352722	In this case, it's your free choice of the spin axis, and that's your reference frame.
1001128	1005272	A	0.7917645573616028	But at the same time, it's it's a physical it's a physical piece of hardware.
1005336	1010640	A	0.8083291053771973	So reference frames are both the piece of hardware but also a piece of semantics.
1012420	1016284	D	0.5475373268127441	So if I take it from the language I don't quite understand to computer science.
1016332	1026036	D	0.9084628820419312	So if Alice and Bob communicate through a piece of memory, whether it's Random Access Memory hard drive, then Alice encodes something on that hard drive and Bob reads from the hard drive.
1026138	1032164	D	0.8423484563827515	So in that sense, they understand how to encode and decode, but they use the same physical piece that's the reference frame.
1032212	1033370	D	0.8802610635757446	Would that be correct?
1035980	1037930	C	0.6884124279022217	I might just add one again.
1038460	1047740	C	0.7814695835113525	Continuing with the computer science and the Shannon alphabet, let's just say that these are plain text character encodings.
1048080	1059600	C	0.8955579400062561	And so they share the same set of character, A through Z encodings that is reflected somewhere physically.
1060180	1070304	C	0.6864153742790222	And so if a message were sent from another letter, it wouldn't render properly.
1070352	1080230	C	0.5599497556686401	It's like outside, they couldn't differentiate Omega from zeta because they only have the A through Z software pack.
1080940	1094060	C	0.7984603643417358	And so there's an informational distinguishment that's facilitated by the information that's classically inscribed on the screen, the memory.
1094960	1103870	C	0.8623983263969421	And there is an embodied physical as well as a semantic aspect to that situation.
1107100	1109364	D	0.7284117341041565	All right, I think I'm getting closer to understanding.
1109412	1117052	D	0.8714653849601746	So, to move away from computer science, if Ellis is a painter, she took a brush, dipped it in red paint and painted on the canvas red.
1117186	1120844	D	0.820925772190094	And Bob has the same understanding of red as Ellis.
1120892	1122464	D	0.8011888861656189	And then he looked at the canvas and red.
1122502	1122704	D	0.6339426636695862	Red.
1122742	1128592	D	0.8793532848358154	Then it is both the physical mark on the canvas and the symbol of red.
1128726	1129410	D	0.7360090017318726	Right?
1130500	1131104	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
1131222	1146888	C	0.5962535738945007	And if somebody had red green colorblindness that physical apparatus was not able to informationally distinguish, then they couldn't make this wick rotation into the quantum cognitive space.
1146974	1153160	C	0.5548059940338135	They wouldn't be able to detect that there was a red figure painted on a green background.
1157420	1161108	A	0.892321765422821	A key component here is that the reference frame is inside of the agent.
1161294	1171410	A	0.8422864675521851	If you are colorblind, there is something physical inside of your head or your eyes or whatever, that does not allow you to see the difference.
1173860	1180320	A	0.7734454274177551	So your semantics are affected ultimately by a physical piece of hardware.
1181380	1187700	D	0.6319652199745178	Yeah, maybe I use the bad example, because color actually is computed in the brain and colorblindness is not necessarily physical.
1188200	1188708	D	0.584351658821106	Okay.
1188794	1190656	D	0.519474446773529	But I think I get it closer.
1190688	1199560	D	0.6250965595245361	But if I may ask another question, I get lost with a saying that preparation and measurement are they have to happen both.
1199630	1204308	D	0.8387178182601929	And that when you prepare or when you read, you modify.
1204484	1208004	D	0.553843080997467	So I am okay with the act of writing, the act of encoding.
1208052	1216844	D	0.8828922510147095	So when I encode something such as I mark red on the canvas or I write to the hard drive A, I modify the hard drive.
1216962	1224476	D	0.7874764800071716	That is true, but if I am asking a question right, I am not modifying anything on the canvas.
1224588	1229772	D	0.8226976990699768	So in what way the act of asking the question or preparation is modifying the qubit.
1229836	1231200	D	0.8656789064407349	This is where I'm lost.
1232580	1233744	D	0.7228710055351257	Does that make sense?
1233862	1241444	A	0.6427208185195923	Yeah, I think this is exactly a question I asked to Chris in in the stream, so I can't quite remember his answer.
1241482	1244260	A	0.8345156311988831	But I think it was basically that they're completely dual pictures.
1245580	1259180	A	0.8683543801307678	Duality in the sense of they're both two ways of looking at the same thing, evolving towards the future, or you have time symmetry.
1259840	1260990	A	0.7446647882461548	You can do either.
1262480	1262892	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1262946	1277772	A	0.5946053862571716	So I myself am slightly confused by the very but I think the answer is that they are painting at the same the picture of or am I preparing?
1277836	1279440	A	0.6806070804595947	Are just completely dual.
1281880	1283648	A	0.8802679181098938	Do you remember that, Daniel?
1283824	1284308	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1284394	1284596	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
1284618	1289430	C	0.8764559626579285	I'll give a different angle than the formal duality relationship.
1289800	1298436	C	0.8658931255340576	So let's think about our measuring device is going to be a carpet, and we're interested in whether somebody has walked on the carpet.
1298548	1305460	C	0.5682878494262695	So to prepare the carpet, we comb it very nicely in one direction.
1305620	1311740	C	0.8370383381843567	And I'm sure there's analogies there with the preparation of qubits in a quantum computer.
1311890	1321288	C	0.8389819264411926	But we're going to comb the carpet as an act of preparation, and then something is going to happen.
1321394	1330450	C	0.6995701193809509	Maybe it's a split second later, and so we're very confident that it should be still nicely combed, or maybe it's going to be a whole working day later.
1330820	1345480	C	0.8898035883903503	But now we're going to take that probe, the tip, whatever it may be, and we're going to run it along the carpet, and we're going to measure the state of the direction of the fibers of the carpet.
1346860	1358460	C	0.5485655665397644	So if we didn't prepare the measurements, we wouldn't have a calibrated reference point to know how things had even changed.
1360000	1385568	C	0.8662667274475098	And so there's a cycle of preparing the apparatus through something like a calibration or at least like an emptying of memory, to be able to then make an observation and to have that observation have the kind of meaning that we would have expected, like purge the photo detector, make the measurement.
1385664	1386964	C	0.6862310767173767	Now you have to purge it again.
1387002	1388048	C	0.7178367376327515	That's the preparation.
1388144	1389620	C	0.8822583556175232	What do you think, Alexey?
1390520	1399332	D	0.8536115288734436	That is a beautiful metaphor, and I dig that, except I think I heard Chris say that when you prepare, you may qubit into up or down.
1399386	1402936	D	0.7228277921676636	And this is what I'm lost, because when you comb the carpet, you don't do that.
1403038	1404744	D	0.6520649194717407	You don't put the footstep on it.
1404782	1406484	D	0.5345274209976196	In fact, there may not be any footstep.
1406532	1406936	B	0.5664745569229126	Right.
1407038	1410972	D	0.5014389157295227	And this is where I'm missing, I think, in quantum physics as well.
1411026	1422912	D	0.5042135119438171	If you measure the cause and effect, relationships are broken here for me, if in my act of preparation, I'm opening my canvas to read the message, but I do not know what the message will be, I'm game.
1423046	1432020	D	0.8318174481391907	But if he's saying that when I prepare, I modify the carpet such that it becomes either up or down, actually not blank, but up or down.
1432090	1433220	D	0.6872210502624512	Then I'm lost.
1433720	1436852	C	0.7673659324645996	You have to comb the carpet up or down.
1436986	1438976	C	0.679913341999054	There's no blank carpet.
1439088	1443376	C	0.796884298324585	So you have an Etch A Sketch.
1443488	1465980	C	0.8760933876037598	You could either make all the pixels white and then you'd be able to measure a message in the dark or you can make all the message dark or the slate dark, and then you could be able to measure something that was light, but you pick a direction of polarization in your preparation or calibration step so that deviations from that can be the measurement.
1468480	1470700	D	0.5351313948631287	So you're saying carpet is binary?
1470780	1472160	D	0.6856247782707214	Carpet doesn't have multiple states.
1472230	1473680	D	0.6739099025726318	Carpet can only have two states.
1473750	1478304	D	0.8515521883964539	So if I prepare it, I effectively put it in one of those states.
1478502	1484320	C	0.8476102352142334	Well, let's say we had the carpet at a 45 degree angle.
1484480	1500410	C	0.5912017226219177	Mathematically we could describe that as a mixed state, and it may not be the most effective for measuring the movement of people across the carpet, but yeah, you could define it or comb it that way.
1501260	1509130	C	0.8048509359359741	If it were only a binary, it wouldn't be a qubit then it would be a classical bit, actually.
1510060	1511372	C	0.6311905384063721	Yeah, under.
1511426	1512350	C	0.4859412908554077	Go for it.
1513680	1514430	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1516080	1526850	A	0.8658602237701416	If I recall lecture a couple of slides more, we briefly talked about it like ten minutes ago.
1527380	1534480	A	0.8860055208206177	By preparing, you are choosing an axis and whatever you up or down in that axis.
1534560	1538390	A	0.5598800778388977	Now, that doesn't mean that the environment gets to do its own thing, right?
1541160	1549672	A	0.8222554922103882	And superposition of outcomes, but at least you're measuring in that axis, right?
1549726	1554600	A	0.8553386330604553	So it's going to be either up or down in that two pictures.
1557040	1566110	A	0.8012726306915283	I just want to see a few words on screens, on the fine line diagrams and maybe clarify question a little more.
1570440	1571300	C	0.6498749852180481	Dean.
1573480	1573976	B	0.6737009882926941	On this.
1573998	1575128	B	0.9286313056945801	Really interesting.
1575294	1591032	B	0.7541512846946716	I don't know how metaphorically you could explain the carpet as a wave, but I think once you get away from the it's up or down, that possibility enters the conversation.
1591176	1607292	B	0.6458184123039246	And the only reason I wonder whether or not metaphorically, the wave aspect of that can be included in how you're describing the carpet is that Chris spent quite a bit of time on the all possible paths argument.
1607356	1614588	B	0.6377828121185303	And in particular, and I love this, when Alice isn't looking right.
1614694	1620790	B	0.6889445781707764	Well, in that wave equation, how could Alice not be looking?
1624390	1625554	B	0.5965173244476318	That's what gets real.
1625592	1634826	B	0.8139508962631226	I mean, Alice could not be looking if it's binary, if it's or up or down, but if it's wave, it's on.
1634888	1637862	B	0.5376530289649963	It's a unitary propagator.
1637926	1648702	B	0.676875114440918	I'm not sure how she takes her eyes off of this preparation measure thing that's going off all the time.
1648836	1671570	B	0.8167202472686768	So this is actually what I consider to be a feature or an opportunity or an opening in the sense that from a strictly information transfer piece not a mechanical piece now, not a physical thing from an information transfer piece, maybe the carpet can be metaphorically understood as a wave.
1672810	1677842	B	0.875667929649353	That the eyes of Alice or whoever's doing the preparing and the measuring.
1677906	1678594	B	0.773097574710846	Bob alice.
1678642	1679414	B	0.5509207248687744	I don't care.
1679532	1690170	B	0.847968339920044	Peaches that there is actually a difference, then between something that is exchanged and something that is informationally transferred.
1690750	1695820	B	0.665611982345581	And again, I don't think that the four of us here sitting right now are going to resolve that.
1696270	1718098	B	0.49807068705558777	But I wonder if part of the difficulty in this is finding the physical metaphor that explains the theoretical transfer in such a way that both breaks the symmetry and holds it.
1718184	1720094	B	0.6385168433189392	Because again, we're back to gripper and grip.
1720142	1726438	B	0.7961233258247375	We're back to figuring it out and outing the physical figures in the state that we're in.
1726524	1729542	B	0.7661325931549072	And we have to do both at once.
1729676	1733542	B	0.6406241655349731	So again, Daniel, you're the creative guy.
1733596	1737770	B	0.8550652265548706	How do you turn your carpet metaphor into a wave equation?
1738830	1746230	C	0.7506503462791443	Maybe there's a subwoofer in the room or maybe somebody is waving the carpet.
1746390	1760350	C	0.8782104253768921	But what you said about what is exchanged and what is transferred, maybe the transfer is the classical component.
1761890	1767038	C	0.8532875180244446	I don't know which one will be exchange or transferred, but one of them is the classical inscription.
1767134	1771362	C	0.8243746161460876	That's how many gigabytes were written or read to the hard drive.
1771496	1776630	C	0.7645580172538757	But what's exchanged, let's just say, are the semantics of meaning.
1776970	1792122	C	0.8424349427223206	And given an appropriate Copeparation, maybe only one bit needs to be transferred for the exchange of a message that was already triggered to be set off.
1792256	1802574	C	0.8212624788284302	And then also, this entire discussion, it kind of strikes me as like the Cartesian duality of our time.
1802772	1813890	C	0.7201911807060242	But rather than mind and body, it's the physicality of information syntax and the metaphysicality of information semantics.
1814390	1823480	C	0.8193350434303284	And that's these kind of two worlds with their own physics and metaphysics that we're trying to connect.
1824090	1831670	C	0.5635018348693848	And it's like, similarly well, how does the information world cause something physical?
1832170	1835070	C	0.6175451278686523	How does the physical cause somethingal?
1835170	1849710	C	0.8457939624786377	And I think that the entire journey that the course and everyone is on is physics as information processing, those as a qualified and distinguished but minimum of two set.
1849860	1850990	C	0.7030236721038818	Alexey?
1852130	1852686	D	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1852788	1853806	D	0.9793016910552979	Thank you so much.
1853908	1854718	D	0.8097810745239258	Can you hear me?
1854804	1855440	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1857090	1858106	D	0.7486352920532227	Thinking out loud?
1858138	1858334	A	0.6050544381141663	Maybe.
1858372	1865058	D	0.7192214131355286	But I think the way to get closer to understanding in my head is to let go of the metaphor of asking a question, right?
1865144	1870594	D	0.8577472567558289	So if Alexi is talking to Daniel through zoom and I pose even a closed question, up or down.
1870792	1876886	D	0.8615695238113403	So I formulated the question and released it into zoom space.
1876988	1880294	D	0.7860567569732666	And then I'm silent and I opened my listening to your answer.
1880412	1884040	D	0.849177896976471	But you, Daniel, have agency to say up or down.
1884490	1888138	D	0.7659339308738708	I do not have any effect on whether you will say up or down.
1888224	1888906	D	0.7360090017318726	Right?
1889088	1889930	D	0.7340604662895203	That's the difference.
1890000	1894410	D	0.73729008436203	So me asking you a question does not modify the answer.
1894560	1895398	D	0.6872091889381409	You decide.
1895494	1896566	D	0.864567220211029	Alice talking to Bob.
1896598	1900106	D	0.7729973196983337	Bob has the agency to answer the question, not Alice.
1900298	1902346	D	0.7308828234672546	And that's where I'm stuck.
1902378	1905950	D	0.5648952126502991	So I don't know if asking a question continues to be a good metaphor.
1906290	1910000	D	0.6678960919380188	Preparing the instrument for measurement is maybe better.
1911030	1913550	D	0.8142837882041931	But actually, Ellis is not asking Bob.
1913630	1915726	D	0.6518093943595886	Ellis is acting on a qubit.
1915918	1916658	D	0.5664745569229126	Right.
1916824	1923762	D	0.7882652282714844	And qubit is is a simple thing that, you know, can can literally physically be up or down, I guess.
1923896	1927890	D	0.763917863368988	And so that's that's maybe, maybe that's the answer that Ellis is not asking.
1927960	1935690	D	0.8233163356781006	Bob Ellis does something to the qubit and because qubit can be up or down, then that's no longer asking a question.
1935760	1940460	D	0.6251055002212524	Asking a question implies your correspondent can tell you anything.
1942270	1960154	C	0.8020618557929993	When we're dealing with the very sophisticated process of natural language question asking, I think we're dealing with something that's orders of composition above the kind of binary ask.
1960292	1962340	C	0.5940688252449036	So I agree with that.
1963030	1977302	C	0.8727861642837524	It's almost like Alice prepares the photoreceptor so its slate is refreshed and then it's the photon or the light emitting object that has the agency to send the photon or not.
1977436	1988262	C	0.6329205632209778	I mean, maybe the preparation occurs and then no one comes back to check whether or not agency was even exerted.
1988406	2012946	C	0.7046890258789062	And I think when we really focus on the nanoprobe like atomic force microscopy, really tracing with a super fine tip over the surface of something, or scattering X rays, when we really think about the moment of information transfer, we realize like, nothing comes for free.
2013048	2024982	C	0.5401179194450378	And I think that this question asking framework, other than really conveniently rederriving quantum mechanics in 1 hour incredibly helps us understand that we don't get to ask it for free in terms of time.
2025116	2026134	C	0.5945137739181519	We don't get to ask.
2026172	2027958	C	0.8040264844894409	It for free in terms of energy.
2028124	2039318	C	0.5317838788032532	And we don't get to ask free floating questions where the question and or agentic responder are not involved already in a semantics.
2039494	2049310	C	0.8839358687400818	So I think it's calling attention to the components of an experiment or a question or an opening.
2049970	2062260	C	0.7631204724311829	But agree that it's not always as simple as a binary question, but in the special simple basal case, it does start there.
2066470	2075010	C	0.8876399993896484	Do you want to look at any of the participant submitted questions, if there was any that struck your let me finish real quick.
2075080	2078360	A	0.8160956501960754	I had like maybe five minutes to wrap this up.
2079370	2083986	A	0.607246458530426	And this, I think, is going to, at least in part, answer one of Dean's concerns.
2084098	2090822	A	0.8172379732131958	So the next thing we should very briefly cover, let's talk a little bit about Holographic screens.
2090966	2097254	A	0.8861040472984314	And also this is the paper on the physical meaning of Holographic principle.
2097302	2101440	A	0.8932825326919556	So let's take a look at also this picture from that paper.
2102130	2120722	A	0.6308093667030334	This is the Holographic boundary and Landauer's principle and all these thermodynamic constraints on information processing necessitate the breakdown of this boundary in terms of free energy extraction sectors, memory sectors and so on.
2120856	2131480	A	0.8716339468955994	And by the way, if you read the paragraphs around this picture, there's more details on how the time QRF is induced, but we'll leave that as it is for now.
2133770	2143130	A	0.7349090576171875	Dean, what I meant by this answering your concern, was that you don't see how Alice can take off her eyes from the picture.
2144190	2146634	A	0.5921170711517334	But that's precisely what's going on here, right?
2146752	2157866	A	0.838575541973114	There's a sector that's being observed, which is a subset of these qubits that are being observed, but presumably she has the freedom to say, hey, this sector.
2157978	2167490	A	0.8900816440582275	Now I declare as my observation sector, this I declare as my memory sector, this I declare as my thermal free energy extraction sector.
2167910	2186046	A	0.5025262832641602	So it is because of these fundamental limits on the amount of information processing, it is not true that she can she doesn't have an idealized Laplacian, if you wish, access to all the degrees of freedom.
2186098	2191722	A	0.7514595985412598	She can only observe, finally, a finite amount of stuff.
2191856	2197870	A	0.5401625633239746	So she is forced to take her eyes off at least part of the system, at least for a while, right?
2197940	2206400	A	0.702009916305542	Because otherwise all those energy and time constraints that Daniel was just mentioning, they're not you have to abide by those.
2209490	2227720	A	0.849485456943512	A few things that Chris mentioned in the last lecture when it came to this holographic screen is, well, number one, that all the information exchange is mediated by bits here at the qubits, at this holographic screen.
2228170	2235746	A	0.7758683562278748	This in turn enforces a finiteness in the information transfer, if you wish.
2235778	2240138	A	0.7055628299713135	There is not an infinite amount of information in finite space.
2240224	2264130	A	0.7903558015823364	Even if you were to pack it at Plankian density, which is presumably the limit that black holes achieve, it's still a finite amount of information in a finite amount of so if you have finite ones, you are taking the other is the following.
2265350	2272930	A	0.8286266922950745	And again, Chris will deal with this at greater detail in perhaps lecture five, I think maybe four.
2273080	2277554	A	0.8698233962059021	But it's the notion of emergent spacetime, which is that A and B separately.
2277602	2293878	A	0.8539432883262634	So you think of these are presumably the internal degrees of freedom, what's going on inside of a alice, at an abstract level, there may not be a notion of space, but notion of space emerges at the boundary.
2294054	2303040	A	0.7370105981826782	And that's not easy to explain, I think, presumably has to do with and stuff like that.
2303730	2317970	A	0.8102471828460693	And I don't know the full details myself, but for now, that's one of the key things that Chris mentioned, which is that an agent may not have space, but it may emerge boundary.
2322630	2328486	A	0.8999547958374023	The last thing, and I'm glad that to see that this was mentioned already, so it saves us time.
2328508	2329750	A	0.5519348382949829	I don't have to say it again.
2329900	2331110	A	0.7932188510894775	Take us a minute.
2334810	2336938	A	0.7464348077774048	And this again answers your can you.
2336944	2340090	C	0.5610235333442688	Just turn off your video under just so you don't have lag?
2340750	2341354	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2341472	2341818	A	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
2341824	2342620	A	0.6189620494842529	1 second.
2347070	2347674	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
2347792	2349162	A	0.7891375422477722	Can you yeah me.
2349296	2350300	A	0.4859412908554077	Go for it.
2351170	2355054	A	0.8728349208831787	This notion of Feyman diagrams, right?
2355252	2361150	A	0.8177851438522339	So what is this whole thing about unitary evolution or preparation?
2362550	2381218	A	0.9220055937767029	The scattering picture as Alice preparing as her of her boundary and writing it into her memory and then measuring it at some point in the future requires that you consider the possible that happened to that preparation.
2381394	2381734	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
2381772	2393226	A	0.8738535642623901	So if there's some amount of time passes, you prepared your state at time T, you look at it again at time T plus DT, you have to take into account all.
2393248	2399402	A	0.7679248452186584	The possible histories, clearly, of the system, or at least that part of the system.
2399456	2407610	A	0.8283752202987671	Writing it's, just saying, I prepared it here, now it's up to b what happens until the next time I look at it, up to the environment.
2407690	2412766	A	0.7365575432777405	So in that unitary evolution, I consider all the possibilities.
2412878	2422434	A	0.6636049747467041	Right, and that's exactly so.
2422472	2424530	A	0.8624301552772522	Let's just look at the conclusion.
2425990	2428758	A	0.7617345452308655	We will leave it there for now.
2428844	2430630	A	0.7730152010917664	We can open up the discussion.
2431290	2435480	A	0.8145216703414917	So there's two things that are now, where was this?
2439710	2440474	A	0.6500546336174011	Go ahead.
2440592	2444138	B	0.6191213130950928	Yeah, I understand.
2444224	2445660	B	0.6115612387657166	Or I think I understand.
2446590	2454320	B	0.7665020823478699	I think I understand that if I'm looking at on or if I'm attending to on, I'm not looking at off.
2455010	2468238	B	0.8992434740066528	What I saw in that wave thing with Federman was I could also be looking at the switch where the two different places of on and off exist.
2468414	2482710	B	0.7482977509498596	And when I'm looking at the entire switch, I'm not looking at one or the other, I'm looking at that basil, as Daniel described, that Basil opportunity of both.
2482860	2495450	B	0.8038271069526672	And I think that on that I don't know how that ties in with reference frames, but on that level that says, I'm now looking at all possible in that moment.
2495520	2506570	B	0.6310663819313049	I don't think, at least from that perspective, that reference frame I'm zooming into an on or off binary choice decision branch.
2506730	2512420	B	0.6157642602920532	I'm still at that place where the preparation allows for both.
2512950	2517650	B	0.5235522389411926	I'm literally not taking my eyes off at that place.
2517720	2532342	B	0.581386148929596	So, again, I'm not arguing with you because what you described and the image that you brought up, all that is is bringing it down to a granular level and saying if I'm paying attention to this, I can't be paying attention to that.
2532476	2545820	B	0.6421539187431335	But if I physically, from a transfer perspective, back up so that I can see both possibilities at once, I don't know that I'm taking my eye off of either.
2546270	2548634	B	0.8316126465797424	That's the only thing that I was bringing up.
2548672	2557342	B	0.6879317164421082	Now, of course, Chris will probably hear this and go, dean, you got to go and rethink this whole thing through, which is great because I'm here to learn.
2557476	2575126	B	0.5601181387901306	But again, if I misspoke about what I was trying to say, it wasn't because I don't see those moments when I'm directing my preparation over here.
2575228	2587062	B	0.8772491216659546	And that's going to give me one kind of measurement versus if I'm taking in a larger time frame or larger spatial frame or larger holographic screen.
2587116	2591322	B	0.7960431575775146	Like I don't even know how to describe it because I just don't have the words for it yet.
2591376	2593194	B	0.5581800937652588	But there you go.
2593232	2596598	B	0.7400181889533997	I just want to be clear that I'm not I don't think I'm confused.
2596694	2605098	B	0.672269880771637	I just want to know the difference between when I'm looking at on or off and when I'm looking at the entire switch.
2605194	2606160	B	0.5908356308937073	That's all.
2607970	2611570	C	0.8822121024131775	I'll add one point on this slide.
2611990	2620530	C	0.8226784467697144	It goes back to some of the earliest points that Chris made about the ontological primacy of communication.
2620950	2624440	C	0.8548394441604614	Space and time arise from communicating agents.
2624970	2631750	C	0.5413024425506592	Communicating agents are not something that we have to squeeze into an a priori spatial temple framework.
2632170	2638486	C	0.7926953434944153	So quantum mechanics saying here on the slide is about measurement, not mechanical motion.
2638678	2649680	C	0.7691434621810913	So we don't need to wait around or speculate as to how from the quote mechanical or physical hard drive measurement arises or happens.
2650130	2663780	C	0.8576822876930237	We start with the measurement occurring and then different kinds of sophisticated agents can conceptualize of movement through spaces and times.
2664470	2674130	C	0.8744131922721863	And this also relates to Bayesian mechanics as a mechanics and a physics of movement on information geometric spaces.
2674650	2689910	C	0.8425664305686951	And so the physics can be projected by appropriately prepared agents, but we don't necessarily need to wonder about how that agent fits within a mechanical setting.
2690070	2704640	C	0.7436200976371765	And I guess this is where humans are with the I am a strange loop girdle escher Bach gripper and gripped mystery of being able to see it multiple ways.
2711730	2714880	C	0.8810178637504578	Andre, do you want to go to the questions?
2715410	2718818	A	0.767401397228241	Yeah, let me just say closing remarks here.
2718984	2748726	A	0.8534821271896362	I think what Chris is punching line of the paper free energy principle for quantum systems, which is morally speaking, it's similar to relaxation to thermodynamical equilibrium, which is that if you have an isolated bipartite quantum system, a and B are going to turn are going to tend towards reference frame alignment and therefore entanglement.
2748918	2755370	A	0.6962399482727051	And these two things are basically very intimately related.
2755950	2761470	A	0.7715530395507812	By aligning the reference frame culia amb will be driven towards maximal entanglement.
2764290	2770754	A	0.8749681711196899	So should I take a look at the questions and open this?
2770792	2788774	A	0.851194441318512	Yeah, so so if you guys have access to the Q and A, there's been more questions in the last bringing you guys'attention to a few of them.
2788972	2835894	A	0.8840135335922241	This is where Chris links to the papers of Robelli, which I mentioned earlier in passing when we were talking about the preparation, measurement cycle and the notion of formal time or subjective time, if you wish, as somebody brought up this remark that performance and calculations here you can relate t time to a change in a change in the volume of face space, or more precisely, the amount of available states in the state space, with a log and whatever with respect to the energy.
2836012	2836680	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
2840810	2846794	A	0.8594212532043457	So this restates the idea that we're talking about earlier, right?
2846832	2858270	A	0.879331111907959	Like your intrinsic subjective time being this DS the eitherative thermal time basically speaking, that is observer dependent.
2859010	2863840	A	0.8034950494766235	So that's a good question to take a look at.
2868150	2869442	A	0.7263793349266052	There's another one.
2869576	2871730	A	0.8472607135772705	What is meant by local free of choice?
2872470	2873842	A	0.9596408009529114	This is a very good answer too.
2873896	2876882	A	0.8723617792129517	Local here means a Sam boundary, right?
2877016	2883090	A	0.48577794432640076	Isolated systems are idealized by definition.
2883170	2886434	A	0.8234155178070068	There's always going to be an observer interacting with an environment.
2886482	2889874	A	0.7621167898178101	So an ISO purely isolated system is an idealization.
2890002	2894266	A	0.7849194407463074	So what local free choice means here is exactly what we said earlier, right?
2894288	2899210	A	0.8721190690994263	That you get to choose the spin axis at the boundary qubits.
2907090	2913790	A	0.920028567314148	There were some nice questions relating mark of blankets to the scattering picture.
2915410	2918340	A	0.6300209760665894	So this one, for instance, is also worth a look.
2919910	2926222	A	0.8775181770324707	So somebody brought up this very good point about the scattering matrix.
2926366	2934662	A	0.7298648357391357	Scattering matrix is by the way, let's not think about it mathematically, let's think about the picture, right?
2934796	2940806	A	0.723322331905365	You imagine two particles that are interacting and far away they are free, right?
2940828	2944330	A	0.8355416655540466	They are specially separated and interacting free particles.
2944990	2948074	A	0.8468756079673767	And somehow at some point they come to interact, right?
2948192	2955600	A	0.8004864454269409	And then you have to write all the finite diagrams for all the exchange of bosons or whatever the interaction is.
2956530	2960462	A	0.8751950263977051	And that's how you would compute the amplitudes for the scattering process, right?
2960516	2967940	A	0.8894643783569336	How those two particles that were separated came to interact and then they go off to infinity again.
2968870	2979540	A	0.6280965805053711	Chris here brings up the point that in a sense, how you define a Markov blanket is in the opposite direction, right?
2980150	2984578	A	0.8718703985214233	Marko blanket in at least in the graph theory sense, you start with a node.
2984674	2994298	A	0.8687321543693542	The marker blanket is just the set of nodes that separate in terms of conditional probability, that node from everyone else.
2994464	3004214	A	0.8734832406044006	And then you can have edges which are going to be directly coastal network, so acyclic, no cycles directed edges.
3004342	3005760	A	0.8325014710426331	That's how the graph looks.
3007170	3012766	A	0.576010525226593	And you build up essentially you're taking the opposite picture, right?
3012788	3024526	A	0.8515447974205017	You start with a node, which in this case would be the interaction, and then you build up to infinity as opposed to in the scattering picture, which is like you start with particles not interacting at infinity.
3024718	3029960	A	0.880035936832428	You see how they go off to infinity again and then the interaction is in the middle.
3031610	3037640	A	0.6093190908432007	So obviously the answer is a bit more precise, but it's worth taking a look at.
3038410	3046326	A	0.9045182466506958	And this is an interesting one too, of a symmetrical input output bandwidth.
3046358	3055722	A	0.7502231597900391	So again, if you think of it as a graph, nothing is constraining you to say that you're going to have more incoming arrows than outcoming arrows into the boundary.
3055786	3056400	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3057250	3058430	A	0.6695422530174255	That's just the way it is.
3058500	3063066	A	0.7744412422180176	If you think of it, a graph, there is no symmetry imposed.
3063258	3066750	A	0.7963391542434692	The only natural sense of symmetry would be energy conservation.
3066830	3084678	A	0.5248910784721375	And that's exactly what Chris says here, right, which is that, and I'm not sure myself how you relate it to a conservation of not quite information, but I wouldn't know how to phrase it myself.
3084844	3087206	A	0.8620066046714783	I would just take a look at the question.
3087308	3095590	A	0.733054518699646	But basically, no, there is a priority nothing that necessitates symmetry input output in mark of blankets.
3096090	3116350	A	0.8369873762130737	But if you are to talk about any sort of symmetry, the natural language would not be in terms of incoming versus outcome in arrows, but rather energy conservation, which we saw is a close casting of information transfer, right, because of the minimal requirements for action to rewrite a qubit.
3117650	3138950	A	0.5064195394515991	And the last question that I would like to bring your guys'attention to, I mean, all of them are great, but we have finite resources and finite times on internet would be would be this one.
3139020	3139350	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
3139420	3141480	A	0.7255308032035828	And I'm not going to go into too much detail.
3142590	3149340	A	0.7780933380126953	But this is again about the local wait 1 second.
3161450	3162806	A	0.814380943775177	Turn on my camera, by the way.
3162828	3165180	C	0.4913307726383209	Dino, go for it.
3169880	3176004	C	0.825232744216919	And also people can see all the questions on the website, right?
3176042	3177750	C	0.8376956582069397	And submit their own as well.
3178200	3179750	A	0.5923560261726379	Yes, for sure.
3180520	3185370	A	0.5401459336280823	So now I lost track of the question that I wanted to show you guys.
3186140	3187752	A	0.8368098735809326	I think it's this one over here.
3187806	3189720	A	0.5172197222709656	Yes, exactly.
3189790	3190520	A	0.6188669800758362	This one.
3190670	3196572	A	0.8904277682304382	By the way, all of them are good, even this one, the Holographic principle, does it make it easier to compute any physics problems?
3196706	3199564	A	0.859446108341217	Well, please take a look at Chris's answer.
3199602	3210770	A	0.7038633227348328	But all I can say is that these ideas of holography, I'm not an expert, I'm not a condensed matter physicist, but they're used all over physics nowadays, not necessarily just in high energy.
3211700	3214884	A	0.7795088291168213	I know that condensed matter theorists use them all the time.
3214922	3222532	A	0.5848250985145569	So the answer to this is an emphatic yes, the Holographic, at least Ada Saft is used all over.
3222666	3230890	A	0.608097493648529	But again, I'm not a physicist myself, so this is the last question I wanted to bring your attention to.
3231980	3264000	A	0.8699594140052795	And here Chris, this may be the one worth taking a look at in terms of in order to answer all the earlier speculations that we had about time internal clock, here somebody asks about synchrony and just the perception of time with respect to external clocks, I suppose.
3264340	3278064	A	0.8873814940452576	And Chris here answers that at the end of the day, even if you're using an external clock, everything that you perceive outside at the end of the day has to be in terms of an internal clock.
3278192	3285572	A	0.8035083413124084	Any information incoming, you're going to have to make causal sense of it, you're going to have to write it into a memory.
3285716	3300492	A	0.5649822354316711	In terms of an internal clock, you're never going to be able to, so to speak, increase your precision of the passage of time by taking that external clock, even if you think it's more precise than anything you have inside.
3300626	3302928	A	0.7839231491088867	I think that's basically what his answer amounts to.
3303014	3321990	A	0.6681556105613708	And this is morally related to all this frame halting problem stuff where because as a system, you're never going to give an infinitely precise I'm speaking very loosely here an infinitely precise description of yourself.
3322760	3327336	A	0.8340941071510315	You're never going to morally speaking again, that's what it amounts to.
3327358	3346780	A	0.5741124749183655	You're never going to be able to outdo your internal clock by trying to leverage something external like an atomic clock, that even if you think it's more precise, at the end of the day, your own subjective perception of information will depend on internal clocks.
3353290	3355382	A	0.5191062092781067	So we can open up things.
3355436	3361770	A	0.9557508230209351	Any concluding remarks and any other Alexey or Dean or anyone else who may have joined?
3362510	3365100	A	0.5664990544319153	I don't have anything else to say at this point.
3367470	3371358	C	0.8348683714866638	I mean, where or when are we?
3371524	3379390	C	0.6802127957344055	We had session one with a real big historical overview.
3381110	3404706	C	0.7801731824874878	Section two, we focused on the Measurability question, which is answered with a question, and we talked about some of the constraints of question asking, namely that it takes time, it takes energy, you have to ask it to somebody or something on an interface, and it has to have a semantic quantum reference frame.
3404898	3417370	C	0.8592828512191772	And this is dovetailing with a free energy principle, of course, because the free energy principle, as it says in the syllables, to what does the free energy principle apply?
3417520	3418662	C	0.6730009317398071	And Chris says everything.
3418736	3419630	C	0.604302167892456	Measurable.
3419970	3428206	C	0.8210088014602661	That's why it's a theory of everything that we choose to measure and model, not ontological statements about what is.
3428388	3433460	C	0.924196183681488	And then where are we heading into in session three?
3435110	3439410	C	0.7915734648704529	Have you looked ahead, Andre, or do you want me to read what's in the syllabus?
3439830	3440530	A	0.5934496521949768	Please do.
3440600	3451094	A	0.8171257972717285	Yeah, I think basically my short answer to that, and possibly my full answer also, is that it's just going to take care of the loose ends in this lecture two.
3451212	3464538	A	0.7631458640098572	So this lecture two is a warm up to the real thing, which we need to talk more seriously about reference frames in order to get the precise picture of this quantum measurement process.
3464624	3474954	C	0.8839682936668396	Yeah, it says that session three will introduce the idea of quantum reference frames and the representation using Hierarchies of binary classifiers.
3475082	3481986	C	0.8490936756134033	These formal structures provide a semantics for measurement and hence provide the basis for a theory of meaning for interacting agents.
3482168	3493070	C	0.611613929271698	The language of QRFs allows a particularly straightforward and intuitive definition of variational free energy, and so allows a fully general quantum formulation of the FEP.
3493230	3501030	C	0.8656343221664429	We will see that the FEP is a classical limit on the principle of unitarity, the fundamental principle of quantum theory.
3503610	3509750	A	0.837691068649292	By the way, Danielle, I'm not sure if you're busy, but I just got an email from Chris.
3509830	3514220	A	0.5456531643867493	I think he may be watching us and I think he's just confused about the link.
3515630	3520334	A	0.7735527157783508	Chris, I don't know if you're there still, but do you think it's worth it?
3520372	3523694	A	0.787139356136322	We send him the link real quick if he can come for a few minutes.
3523812	3524480	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3526370	3530640	C	0.8695015907287598	I'll send Chris the zoom link now.
3531010	3535620	C	0.7848638296127319	Yeah, hold on to your qubit, Chris, we're coming.
3536230	3540738	A	0.7685298919677734	Yeah, so let's give him a few minutes.
3540824	3545506	A	0.4623401463031769	Maybe he's still watching and he'll answer the questions better than I could.
3545608	3550070	B	0.8211529850959778	Well, Daniel is sending him a lifeline.
3551130	3570938	B	0.8297043442726135	Just from the rookie perspective on this session one seemed like there was a big time window, like the historical piece over using an external clock and a timeline.
3571114	3591838	B	0.8526418209075928	This one felt like the parabola and the upper down and the entanglement was almost instantaneous in terms of that plank length that we were really holding up as comparative to that timeline, that chronological timeline.
3592014	3601526	B	0.7374422550201416	And so I'm guessing that now that we've established those two as different, where does that go?
3601628	3605880	B	0.6532986164093018	But again, that's just the rookies view of things.
3611310	3612278	C	0.7477753162384033	Hey, Chris.
3612374	3613020	C	0.7317204475402832	Welcome.
3613790	3614682	E	0.6332176923751831	Yeah, hi.
3614736	3627760	E	0.9712651371955872	This is a very interesting discussion and it's given me some pointers as to what to emphasize at the beginning of session three.
3628690	3644980	E	0.8744548559188843	But I can say in response to Dean's question that the time when Alice isn't looking is the time during which Bob is making his measurement and then his next preparation step.
3645910	3663050	E	0.8931440114974976	So if you consider again that slide that shows sort of the feynman representation of what's happening as this unitary flow, that's what Bob is doing.
3663120	3676160	E	0.6806620359420776	And I think Andrew said that from Alice's point of view, bob is just some quantum system and she's banged on that system by asking a question.
3677010	3690722	E	0.6835742592811584	And now that system is doing something or other that she can't see until Bob bangs on his side of the screen and she gets some information.
3690856	3700440	E	0.5916575789451599	By making a measurement, she may be not looking for a very short period of time.
3701930	3702630	E	0.5664745569229126	Right.
3702780	3705350	E	0.8074571490287781	According to her internal clock.
3705690	3711660	E	0.6403371691703796	She's not looking for just the time it takes for one of her internal ticks to take place.
3713150	3722486	E	0.7773308157920837	But in general, we're not saying anything about how long that time is, right?
3722528	3749800	E	0.8082985281944275	If you think of this in a scattering theory way, then we're talking about the time between two protons leaving the rings on the Large Hadron Collider to the time that all the stuff that comes out of their collision is measured by the detectors, which is a nanosecond or something like that, some very short period of time.
3752890	3769370	E	0.8705200552940369	So just think of that interval as the measure of the intrinsic time dependence, external time dependence of the interaction.
3769710	3772974	E	0.7609555125236511	Someone has to do something and then someone else has to do something.
3773012	3780030	E	0.557124674320221	And there's a gap between what the first person does and what they see in response.
3781890	3794290	E	0.8697690963745117	Let's see what's the other question the other central question that came up today was the question of why observing something requires action.
3794870	3800280	E	0.7503807544708252	And of course, in the classical picture, observing something doesn't require any action at all.
3802250	3803960	E	0.7506803274154663	The event just happens.
3804890	3819660	E	0.8586556315422058	And this is the fundamental, if you will, distinction between classical and quantum theory is that making an observation in quantum theory is taking an action on the world.
3820590	3837330	E	0.8415607213973999	And there's a lovely metaphor that's not correct in detail but it's very useful, I think, conceptually which heisenberg came up with to try to explain his uncertainty principle to his classical colleagues.
3837990	3845010	E	0.858184278011322	He said, look, suppose I'm trying to see a very small particle and measure its motion.
3847030	3853362	E	0.850930392742157	I have to have a microscope to see this particle and to measure its motion.
3853426	3854966	E	0.6213513612747192	I need to light it up.
3854988	3856646	E	0.6807092428207397	I need to shine some light on it.
3856748	3862780	E	0.8455735445022583	And those photons of light are actually impacting the thing I'm trying to see.
3863790	3871020	E	0.7614251971244812	So the act of observation itself requires banging something into an object.
3872610	3882320	E	0.6933141946792603	And when we're just looking out at the world, it's the sun that's banging the light into the object, not us.
3882690	3892340	E	0.767789363861084	But we can sort of merge those two systems together because it's the sun that's taking the action that lets us get some information.
3893110	3899160	E	0.5014904737472534	But the sun is perturbing the things that we're looking at by banging photons into them.
3901210	3918874	E	0.8237199783325195	And I think that picture of Heisenberg's is what he used to actually derive the uncertainty principle in terms of momentum and position, because banging something into something is transferring momentum to it.
3918912	3931674	E	0.8130151033401489	Photons transfers the momentum to the tiny particle in the microscope, and that perturbs its position on the microscope stage, which is precisely what heisenberg is trying to measure.
3931802	3935970	E	0.8131101727485657	So that's his point in that analogy.
3936550	3940238	E	0.7730628252029419	Observation itself always takes action.
3940334	3948514	E	0.8334342837333679	And that's why observation and preparation are duals in quantum theory, because they each require a minimum one unit of action.
3948642	3956120	E	0.5515364408493042	And I think, Andrew, you said the duality can be thought of in terms of time invariance, and that's exactly correct.
3956890	3961346	E	0.6092169284820557	Preparation is just measurement run backwards and vice versa.
3961458	3983390	A	0.7384674549102783	And if you let me say a few words, I think this also answers my own confusion and the one that Alexey the question that Alexi posed earlier, which is this duality between preparation and measurement in your picture that you're bringing up Chris with heisenberg by shining photons on particle that I'm trying to observe.
3985030	3990882	A	0.8126046657562256	These pictures of preparation and measurement are dual because in doing so, I'm constraining the system.
3990936	3993220	A	0.7931637763977051	In trying to measure it, I'm constraining it.
3995030	3999126	A	0.8267136216163635	In me trying to gather information by shining photons on it.
3999228	4001862	A	0.8090705275535583	What I'm really doing is I'm constraining it.
4001916	4008438	A	0.7373136878013611	I'm just saying you can only take this moment or position.
4008604	4009720	A	0.8802610635757446	Would that be correct?
4012270	4012778	E	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4012864	4023790	E	0.7526291012763977	In fact, in the microscope example, it's particularly clear you're bouncing a photon off of the object, and then it's that photon that you're detecting.
4025410	4026160	E	0.5664745569229126	Right.
4026930	4031646	E	0.6429530382156372	There was one other question that can be answered quickly.
4031748	4045186	E	0.9000020027160645	It was the question about what's the reference frame that Alice is using when she's measuring up or down, measuring her spin up or down.
4045368	4056262	E	0.5725098848342896	And of course, there are several reference frames involved here, so let's work inwards in a real system.
4056396	4057574	E	0.8619001507759094	Alice is sitting here.
4057612	4070070	E	0.8920880556106567	She's got a Stern Girlock apparatus, which is a vertical magnet apparatus, and she's measuring the spin of an electron that's traveling through this Stern Girlock device.
4070230	4084590	E	0.786818265914917	And what the Stern Girlock device does is orient the spin with a magnetic field that's not homogeneous, so it ends up pointing physically up as it comes through the apparatus.
4085590	4089614	E	0.7764148116111755	So how is that apparatus oriented?
4089662	4093250	E	0.8393703103065491	I mean, what defines the up direction for that apparatus?
4093590	4101880	E	0.869520902633667	Well, in the practical setting, what defines that apparatus orientation is the Earth's gravitational field.
4102330	4103080	E	0.5664745569229126	Right.
4103530	4109078	E	0.8385091423988342	We're here in the laboratory, and the Earth's gravitational field tells us what direction is down.
4109164	4119974	E	0.6994479298591614	It's toward the center of the Earth, and so up is away from the center of the Earth, and that's what defines the axis for the apparatus, which is a great big piece of metal.
4120022	4123680	E	0.633540689945221	So it's very responsive to the gravitational field.
4124610	4127242	E	0.8867398500442505	So now we can ask about Alice.
4127306	4127534	E	0.5664745569229126	Right.
4127572	4135890	E	0.8063311576843262	Alice is also embedded in this gravitational field, and she also can detect the gravitational field.
4135960	4143406	E	0.8816009163856506	She can tell which way is down toward the center of the Earth by the force acting on her feet.
4143598	4148230	E	0.8603273630142212	And that measurement is taking place in Alice's brain.
4148570	4160810	E	0.8889120817184448	So in Alice's brain, there's a representation of which way is up, and that's the internal reference frame of Alice that lets her do the experiment.
4161630	4175054	E	0.7717450857162476	If she was freely floating in space, but the apparatus was anchored to the gravitational field, she wouldn't be able to tell that it was anchored to the gravitational field.
4175172	4187650	E	0.7694008350372314	That's Einstein's point that Einstein makes in all of those experiments where he has observers flying around in spacecraft that they have to have their own reference frame.
4189510	4194500	E	0.6415343880653381	What Einstein didn't emphasize was that reference frame is in their head.
4194870	4197220	E	0.6780193448066711	It's encoded by their nervous system.
4198550	4217740	E	0.7601710557937622	So I think it was Daniel who said this exactly correctly, that the physical object in her head, the the actual neural network that tells her which way the gravitational field is, is itself a semantic object.
4218670	4224750	E	0.7225234508514404	That's what gives the word up and down meaning for Alice.
4225490	4227914	E	0.6554887294769287	What do I mean when I say the word meaning?
4228042	4230510	E	0.775732159614563	I mean, it lets her take some action.
4232850	4239086	E	0.8402793407440186	Semantics boils down to actionability if it gives things significance.
4239278	4259160	E	0.7088689804077148	And this was the point that Bateson was making when he said, differences that make a difference for an organism, something is meaningful if it actually makes a difference for what I can do in this world that I'm trying to survive in.
4260730	4262806	E	0.7172985076904297	So I'll leave it at that.
4262908	4268550	E	0.9393317103385925	But this is very useful for leading off the next session.
4268630	4271850	E	0.9786539673805237	So thank you very much for all that discussion.
4272830	4273578	C	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
4273744	4274326	C	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
4274368	4281790	A	0.7899260520935059	I guess if I could say one thing here is that let me scroll back up to the three points early in the slides.
4282530	4289982	A	0.8025519251823425	Differences that make a difference would tell you that you require action to perturb a system and measure.
4290126	4299650	A	0.850443959236145	And then the semantics or the contextuality that may be encoded in the nervous system would tell you what is the difference that is being made.
4299800	4301026	A	0.8802610635757446	Would that be correct?
4301208	4301986	E	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4302168	4302994	E	0.5664745569229126	Right.
4303192	4305540	E	0.8196168541908264	What tells you that there's a difference there?
4305910	4309846	E	0.84791100025177	It's what you're able to detect and represent internally.
4309918	4315542	C	0.6850284934043884	It's almost like step one, do differently.
4315686	4319018	C	0.806311309337616	Step two, you have to ask it to a different thing.
4319184	4328960	C	0.7303928136825562	And then three, you need the semantic frame that makes A and B different differences all the way down.
4330850	4337774	C	0.7582607269287109	Well, we will transcribe this and fix the few patchy moments ender.
4337822	4350820	C	0.7409608960151672	We'll work together on updating the transcript so that everybody who wants to be well prepared for the measurement of the third lecture will be absolutely in place.
4353910	4355166	C	0.9787036776542664	Thank you, Chris, for joining.
4355198	4359150	C	0.8124996423721313	That's a fun cap to this discussion.
4359310	4361338	E	0.8753083944320679	So, all right, thank you.
4361424	4362490	C	0.5591034889221191	See you all next time.
4362560	4362790	A	0.5137446522712708	Bye.
