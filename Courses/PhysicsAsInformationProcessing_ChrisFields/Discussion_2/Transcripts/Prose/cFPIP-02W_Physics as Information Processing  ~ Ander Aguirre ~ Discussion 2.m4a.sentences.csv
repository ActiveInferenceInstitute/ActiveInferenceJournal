6480	7230	2	Daniel	0.80855	Hello.
7600	10524	3	Daniel	0.55743	It's July 1, 2023.
10642	14840	4	Daniel	0.67148	We're in “Physics as Information Processing” in the second discussion.
15000	18732	5	Daniel	0.98706	So thanks all for joining, and we'll see who else comes in.
18786	25288	6	Daniel	0.99917	If you're watching Live, feel free to write questions in the Live chat and I'll relay them onwards.
25464	26584	7	Daniel	0.99871	So Ander,
26712	27244	8	Daniel	0.99995	thanks,
27362	33750	9	Daniel	1	nd it would be awesome to begin with a little bit of some overview and some points that you wanted to get to.
34840	35204	10	Ander	0.99675	Yeah.
35242	36340	11	Ander	0.9999	Thank you, Daniel.
37000	38420	12	Ander	0.98346	So, good morning, everyone.
38570	47290	13	Ander	0.72681	So if you would start what Chris spoke about last time.
49180	51610	14	Ander	0.52	I have a few slides that I singled out.
52940	66620	15	Ander	0.83095	So now we're getting to reformulation of quantum theory in terms of reformulation of opposed to dynamical theory.
67540	76720	16	Ander	1	And as we've talked in previous sessions, we need to think a little bit philosophically about what the ontology of measurement entails.
77940	82580	17	Ander	0.9989	So Chris last lecture started with these three basic ingredients.
84920	91524	18	Ander	0.55028	So an action that's, number one, a thing to ask about.
91722	98410	19	Ander	0.99997	This is the qubit, the physical degrees of freedom that we need to perturb in some way to ask a question.
98780	106380	20	Ander	1	And then finally, a semantics, a language that makes sense, a context that makes sense of that information that we gather.
108960	118928	21	Ander	0.56845	So I should say, number one, I came up in the first question when I can't exactly remember.
119014	122210	22	Ander	0.99999	But at some point, we talked about what is information?
122820	129956	23	Ander	0.99	And we came up with or we brought up a definition that goes something like this.
129978	130784	24	Ander	0.96136	It's a nice adage.
130832	133828	25	Ander	0.99702	It's “a differences that make a difference.”
133914	144136	26	Ander	0.47647	This is… Chris told me… I can't remember who first coined this adage, but I think it's quite old, at least early 70s.
144238	148616	27	Ander	0.99998	Anyway, so number one, basically perturb that part, right?
148718	152596	28	Ander	0.99994	If I want to gather some information, I need to perturb a system somehow.
152628	153844	29	Ander	0.99997	So I need to act.
153982	157580	30	Ander	0.68	And this is literally in units of actions, right?
157650	159916	31	Ander	0.99993	So units of energy times time.
160018	169260	32	Ander	0.6	And he provided the example of rhodopsin, which is apparently near optimal from a quantum perspective.
169340	173936	33	Ander	0.99967	This is mechanically what goes on in your eyes as light comes in.
174118	177920	34	Ander	1	And this is clearly the difference that makes a difference in your brain.
180360	182992	35	Ander	1	The second part were the physical degrees of freedom.
183056	188836	36	Ander	0.9999	So recall that we had a boundary, okay?
188938	219310	37	Ander	0.99975	So this theory of quantum mechanics as measurement necessarily breaks down the system into a bipartite system with a boundary, which […] are a lot smaller than the degrees of freedom of A and B, at least in terms of the dimension of the Hilbert space and media change.
220580	222560	38	Daniel	0.99693	Sorry, can you repeat, Ander?
223540	224304	39	Ander	0.9779	Repeat what?
224342	226400	40	Daniel	0.7532	Sorry, just last 30 seconds.
226900	227456	41	Ander	0.99898	Yeah.
227558	248010	42	Ander	0.9818	So the second ingredient is the physical medium in which this information exchange occurs, where the physical degrees of freedom, the qubits, are arranged, and these are physically perturbed in order to mediate that difference that makes a difference.
248940	253880	43	Ander	0.99995	So we can think of this dually as either preparing those qubits or decoding those qubits.
255040	261820	44	Ander	0.91	And then finally, there was the notion of the reference frame.
262320	270524	45	Ander	0.89406	Okay, so the theory necessitates a free choice of the agent of a reference frame.
270572	280096	46	Ander	0.94	And physically what this amounts to is a free choice of a measurement axis for those qubits.
280128	285408	47	Ander	0.99924	So we can think of measuring z spin in those qubits on the boundary.
285504	290500	48	Ander	0.97442	So that requires a free choice of that axis.
291500	298228	49	Ander	0.99	And this amounts to your reference frame, the context in which those measurements are performed.
298404	308140	50	Ander	0.79628	On one extreme case, we have that if those references are perfectly aligned, then the exchange of information is noiseless.
308640	308956	51	Ander	0.91209	There.
308978	310524	52	Ander	0.56451	Was it somewhere over here?
310562	313240	53	Ander	0.99	I think I can't quite recall.
313320	319344	54	Ander	0.52519	But generically, these two reference frames of Alice and Bob, A and B are not exactly the same.
319462	321772	55	Ander	0.91936	They get to choose the reference frames.
321836	324848	56	Ander	0.75	I think it's all the way on the bottom, actually.
325014	326988	57	Ander	0.97022	Right, so they can be aligned.
327004	330164	58	Ander	0.9996	If they're aligned, they are exchanging noiseless information.
330282	330708	59	Ander	0.93877	Right.
330794	338900	60	Ander	0.99997	There is no randomness if they are not superposition onto.
339720	343684	61	Ander	0.89	And that's when you're going to get probabilities in the outcomes.
343812	345240	62	Ander	0.99249	Trivial probabilities.
346140	347450	63	Ander	0.94695	So far, so good.
349260	349864	64	Ander	0.66298	Yes.
349982	356108	65	Ander	0.998	Okay, so I have a few more comments of the main things.
356274	357084	66	Ander	0.79355	Okay.
357282	360780	67	Ander	0.49912	It'll take me a few minutes and then we can chat back and forth.
361520	368768	68	Ander	0.73109	Perhaps this slide is interesting, important.
368854	377584	69	Ander	0.53	I remember this is where I asked the question myself, because it's not easy to wrap your head around what's going on here.
377782	382020	70	Ander	0.99769	So we said that measurement and preparation are completely dual pictures.
383080	387056	71	Ander	0.99987	So this is going to be expanded on in the next lecture.
387248	402920	72	Ander	0.61144	But a jerk corollary of that is that if you prepare Chris said it in similar terms, if you prepare something in a certain state and then you measure it right away, you should expect that it's still in that state, right?
403070	413310	73	Ander	0.98226	So, intuitively speaking, this induces a cycle, right, where you have preparation and measurement and you're back to square one, so to speak.
414560	424990	74	Ander	0.64	And in generating that cycle, obviously there has to be some notion of time, right?
426160	435156	75	Ander	0.99797	So that's where we're going to have to make sense of the distinction between internal and external time.
435258	444936	76	Ander	0.99999	If we take this measurement operator and here perform some operations, we can write it as a unitary propagator from quantum mechanics, which again preserves information.
445038	446970	77	Ander	0.92147	It just leaves the state as it is.
448460	456392	78	Ander	0.58351	But with this little trick of the week rotation, you can write it as e to the measurement up to a constant.
456536	469490	79	Ander	0.52	And that precisely encodes, at least morally speaking, what we just said, right, that this preparation measurement thing is a cycle, and more importantly, it gets rid of this t external time.
470820	478572	80	Ander	1	And presumably in here it's going to be replaced by some notion of internal time.
478726	487380	81	Ander	0.99885	We're going to have an internal time QRF, that is the true local time, as the observer perceives.
488520	501770	82	Ander	0.95418	I'm not entirely certain of the details, but now, looking at it, here the beta, which presumably there's beta and inverse temperature here.
502220	506364	83	Ander	0.64	I think this is going to be intimately related to notions of thermal time.
506482	519710	84	Ander	0.99956	This has been explored in papers by [Carlo] Rovelli called Internal Time Reversal[?] [[Rovelli (1993) Statistical mechanics of gravity and the thermodynamical origin of time]]. And Thermal Time is the way in which the observer observes the passage of time.
521120	524432	85	Ander	0.90617	Those papers of Rovelli are linked in the Q and A by the way.
524486	527010	86	Ander	0.99985	So I can also provide links later.
530020	531696	87	Ander	0.58	I think there might have been a question.
531798	532796	88	Ander	0.64412	Should I stop?
532838	533664	89	Daniel	0.89301	Yeah, Dean.
533712	534710	90	Daniel	0.99996	Go for it.
535800	552200	91	Dean	1	I was curious about this because what I heard Chris start this session with was that he was going to try to help us understand when we are looking at something through a mechanical lens.
552540	576524	92	Dean	0.98584	So quantum mechanics and to me this slide was the way of addressing, as he said his words were characterized information transfer in a quantum theoretic way that the translation from H to M took the mechanics aspect out of the change or timepiece.
576572	589860	93	Dean	0.99998	It was the purification, the most theoretical form of transfer of information as opposed to holding up just the one ordered or sequenced or mechanical lens.
591160	599704	94	Dean	1	I heard you ask the question and I kind of smiled because I thought to myself no, I understand why Anders is asking this question.
599902	611196	95	Dean	0.50223	It's can something be both gripper in the conceptual meaning sense ontologically and gripped a physical object.
611298	614712	96	Dean	1	And I think what I thought maybe I was misinterpreting.
614776	618128	97	Dean	0.50543	I'd like what your perspective on this is.
618294	626940	98	Dean	0.99995	That ability to go from H to M is what allows us to have both the mechanical and the theoretical.
627020	634532	99	Dean	1	The transference in its purest sense is that being able to have both can be true.
634666	637300	100	Dean	0.66848	Is that what it is?
637370	638710	101	Ander	0.99986	Yes, for sure.
641900	642650	102	Ander	0.97173	Yeah.
647120	649950	103	Ander	0.99434	Much else to say here.
652320	661068	104	Ander	0.99994	It is true that you can think of the information transfer picture as an enlargement or an addition to the mechanical picture.
661244	666770	105	Ander	0.99	And that I don't think that the mechanical picture has to be just thrown out completely.
667380	675232	106	Ander	1	I think it's interesting to keep it to see how it can be recovered from the information processing picture.
675376	681904	107	Ander	0.99996	This reminds me actually there is an Italian physicist, I think his name is Kiribella.
681952	692512	108	Ander	0.97	And Dean, if you want, I can link you the papers later who is very fond of the information theoretical approach to quantum mechanics and deducing quantum mechanics from first principles.
692676	718500	109	Ander	1	And he has a paper, I think the title is Physics without Physics or something like that, where he treats this whole thing as a big seller automaton and by taking appropriate scaling limits he derives QFT non interacting QFT.
718920	727700	110	Ander	0.59197	So he says, okay, let me start with some axioms how information should be information processing.
729880	731928	111	Ander	0.56	I mean, I'm very loose here.
732014	741130	112	Ander	0.99962	Then get a cellular automaton out of this and then take scaling and recover QFT, non interacting QFT at least.
741660	748190	113	Ander	0.99965	So start with a few axioms about information processing, recover mechanics from that.
749440	751630	114	Ander	0.99968	Does that add to your question a little bit?
752080	752830	115	Dean	0.99725	Yeah.
754720	759104	116	Dean	0.99996	All I'm trying to do is tie this back into some of the live streams that we've done in the past.
759142	761500	117	Dean	0.99	And I know I use different language.
761660	769092	118	Dean	0.82	I am not a scientist and I've not studied quantum other than sort of in passing ways.
769146	787064	119	Dean	0.78945	But I do think that what this spoke to me about was something that I've always tried to include, which is that there's the figure it out piece, which to me is the conceptual and the meaning part that Chris talked about very clearly here.
787182	789320	120	Dean	1	And then there's the outing of the figure.
789390	807264	121	Dean	0.99962	There's this sort of physical edge and boundary that if you don't have an awareness of both things happening concurrently the preparation and the measure are a unitary of sort of minimum of two state then all bets are off.
807302	820404	122	Dean	0.9984	In terms of being able to think of these propagators and operators and all of the ways that we're trying to explain the situation they're off.
820522	822710	123	Dean	0.90622	So we have to have both.
823240	830332	124	Dean	0.99945	We have to have that sense that there is a transfer and there is the mechanics.
830496	833160	125	Dean	0.99981	We have to keep both juggling all the time.
833310	843272	126	Dean	0.89152	So that's where this one particular slide was really quite both bias-confirming for me.
843406	848856	127	Dean	0.99997	But I think it also, as you say, is going to open up a lot that July.
849048	850108	128	Ander	0.81072	Yeah, I agree.
850194	855260	129	Ander	0.99	I think this might be the most important or mysterious situation slide.
856020	856336	130	Dean	0.96215	Yeah.
856358	866492	131	Dean	0.84	And it turns the pyramid, the conventional approach here's a pyramid into a top that can be spun [Laughs] essentially with a Wick rotation.
866636	874032	132	Dean	1	And it validates how information transfer probably gets short shrift in most of this quantum conversation.
874096	880808	133	Dean	0.66051	But it's probably at least an equal to the mechanical part.
880974	884250	134	Dean	0.99996	What order are we delivering this information in?
885580	886344	135	Dean	0.99	At that point
886382	887000	136	Dean	0.81556	I'll stop.
887070	887690	137	Daniel	0.99988	Thanks.
891820	893000	138	Daniel	0.56634	Alexey.
894400	895884	139	Alexey	0.52164	Hi, can you hear me?
896002	896670	140	Daniel	0.74268	Yes.
901200	905376	141	Alexey	0.99999	My mathematics teacher in high school used to say this is beautiful, but I don't quite understand it.
905398	910544	142	Alexey	0.57567	So I wanted to maybe I have two questions, but I'll start with this simpler one.
910582	920160	143	Alexey	0.99829	So when Chris talked about the reference frame and said common language, I think in Shannon common language is the alphabet.
920240	923716	144	Alexey	0.99205	There's a receiver and Sandra and the alphabet that they share.
923898	930156	145	Alexey	1	And then Chris said this reference frame is a physical thing like neurons or hands or mouth.
930208	942960	146	Alexey	0.69	And then I got lost because if when I encode I modify something on the hard drive, then the physical components of the hard drive is the reference frame.
943060	946300	147	Alexey	0.99605	But this is not the shared language.
946720	948812	148	Alexey	0.71645	So that's my first question.
948866	950190	149	Alexey	0.99999	Maybe I'll stop here.
951120	961440	150	Alexey	1	I understand we're dealing in metaphors, but I want to understand that the reference frame up or down, if Bob and Alice understand it similarly, then is that really physical?
961780	968064	151	Ander	0.98	I think answer is that Chris would
968102	969884	152	Ander	0.95498	probably give a better answer…
969884	969932	152	Daniel	0.7576	Start from the beginning, Ander. Go.
969932	975952	153	Ander	0.7576	… is that both are true at the same time.
976006	978448	154	Ander	1	I think Chris would give you a better answer.
978534	991220	155	Ander	0.59766	But the semantics or sorry, the sherling, which a reference frame has to have physical embodiment and that's a piece of hardware.
991300	992810	156	Ander	0.99991	It's a neuron or something.
993660	1001096	157	Ander	0.71399	In this case, it's your free choice of the spin axis, and that's your reference frame.
1001128	1005272	158	Ander	0.77741	But at the same time, it's it's a physical it's a physical piece of hardware.
1005336	1010640	159	Ander	0.99997	So reference frames are both the piece of hardware but also a piece of semantics.
1012420	1016284	160	Alexey	0.99846	So if I take it from the language I don't quite understand to computer science.
1016332	1026036	161	Alexey	0.99974	So if Alice and Bob communicate through a piece of memory, whether it's Random Access Memory hard drive, then Alice encodes something on that hard drive and Bob reads from the hard drive.
1026138	1032164	162	Alexey	0.99998	So in that sense, they understand how to encode and decode, but they use the same physical piece that's the reference frame.
1032212	1033370	163	Alexey	0.99913	Would that be correct?
1035980	1037930	164	Daniel	0.55	I might just add one again.
1038460	1047740	165	Daniel	0.97191	Continuing with the computer science and the Shannon alphabet, let's just say that these are plain text character encodings.
1048080	1059600	166	Daniel	1	And so they share the same set of character, A through Z encodings that is reflected somewhere physically.
1060180	1070304	167	Daniel	1	And so if a message were sent from another letter, it wouldn't render properly.
1070352	1080230	168	Daniel	0.99724	It's like outside, they couldn't differentiate Omega from zeta because they only have the A through Z software pack.
1080940	1094060	169	Daniel	1	And so there's an informational distinguishment that's facilitated by the information that's classically inscribed on the screen, the memory.
1094960	1103870	170	Daniel	1	And there is an embodied physical as well as a semantic aspect to that situation.
1107100	1109364	171	Alexey	0.95149	All right, I think I'm getting closer to understanding.
1109412	1117052	172	Alexey	0.99991	So, to move away from computer science, if Ellis is a painter, she took a brush, dipped it in red paint and painted on the canvas red.
1117186	1120844	173	Alexey	0.66	And Bob has the same understanding of red as Ellis.
1120892	1122464	174	Alexey	1	And then he looked at the canvas and red.
1122502	1122704	175	Alexey	0.72517	Red.
1122742	1128592	176	Alexey	0.9224	Then it is both the physical mark on the canvas and the symbol of red.
1128726	1129410	177	Alexey	0.99922	Right?
1130500	1131104	178	Ander	0.59549	Yes.
1131222	1146888	179	Daniel	1	And if somebody had red green colorblindness that physical apparatus was not able to informationally distinguish, then they couldn't make this wick rotation into the quantum cognitive space.
1146974	1153160	180	Daniel	0.65225	They wouldn't be able to detect that there was a red figure painted on a green background.
1157420	1161108	181	Ander	0.96	A key component here is that the reference frame is inside of the agent.
1161294	1171410	182	Ander	0.99999	If you are colorblind, there is something physical inside of your head or your eyes or whatever, that does not allow you to see the difference.
1173860	1180320	183	Ander	0.97991	So your semantics are affected ultimately by a physical piece of hardware.
1181380	1187700	184	Alexey	0.98788	Yeah, maybe I use the bad example, because color actually is computed in the brain and colorblindness is not necessarily physical.
1188200	1188708	185	Alexey	0.99039	Okay.
1188794	1190656	186	Alexey	0.99992	But I think I get it closer.
1190688	1199560	187	Alexey	1	But if I may ask another question, I get lost with a saying that preparation and measurement are they have to happen both.
1199630	1204308	188	Alexey	0.82	And that when you prepare or when you read, you modify.
1204484	1208004	189	Alexey	0.99909	So I am okay with the act of writing, the act of encoding.
1208052	1216844	190	Alexey	0.99948	So when I encode something such as I mark red on the canvas or I write to the hard drive A, I modify the hard drive.
1216962	1224476	191	Alexey	1	That is true, but if I am asking a question right, I am not modifying anything on the canvas.
1224588	1229772	192	Alexey	0.71515	So in what way the act of asking the question or preparation is modifying the qubit.
1229836	1231200	193	Alexey	0.99999	This is where I'm lost.
1232580	1233744	194	Alexey	0.99996	Does that make sense?
1233862	1241444	195	Ander	0.99982	Yeah, I think this is exactly a question I asked to Chris in in the stream, so I can't quite remember his answer.
1241482	1244260	196	Ander	0.99999	But I think it was basically that they're completely dual pictures.
1245580	1259180	197	Ander	0.50549	Duality in the sense of they're both two ways of looking at the same thing, evolving towards the future, or you have time symmetry.
1259840	1260990	198	Ander	1	You can do either.
1262480	1262892	199	Ander	0.92491	Yeah.
1262946	1277772	200	Ander	0.69232	So I myself am slightly confused by the very but I think the answer is that they are painting at the same the picture of or am I preparing?
1277836	1279440	201	Ander	0.99902	Are just completely dual.
1281880	1283648	202	Ander	0.99347	Do you remember that, Daniel?
1283824	1284308	203	Ander	0.99978	Yeah.
1284394	1284596	204	Ander	0.99855	Okay.
1284618	1289430	205	Daniel	0.91157	I'll give a different angle than the formal duality relationship.
1289800	1298436	206	Daniel	0.9586	So let's think about our measuring device is going to be a carpet, and we're interested in whether somebody has walked on the carpet.
1298548	1305460	207	Daniel	0.9998	So to prepare the carpet, we comb it very nicely in one direction.
1305620	1311740	208	Daniel	1	And I'm sure there's analogies there with the preparation of qubits in a quantum computer.
1311890	1321288	209	Daniel	0.99999	But we're going to comb the carpet as an act of preparation, and then something is going to happen.
1321394	1330450	210	Daniel	0.99999	Maybe it's a split second later, and so we're very confident that it should be still nicely combed, or maybe it's going to be a whole working day later.
1330820	1345480	211	Daniel	0.99996	But now we're going to take that probe, the tip, whatever it may be, and we're going to run it along the carpet, and we're going to measure the state of the direction of the fibers of the carpet.
1346860	1358460	212	Daniel	0.96214	So if we didn't prepare the measurements, we wouldn't have a calibrated reference point to know how things had even changed.
1360000	1385568	213	Daniel	0.61	And so there's a cycle of preparing the apparatus through something like a calibration or at least like an emptying of memory, to be able to then make an observation and to have that observation have the kind of meaning that we would have expected, like purge the photo detector, make the measurement.
1385664	1386964	214	Daniel	0.99999	Now you have to purge it again.
1387002	1388048	215	Daniel	0.76608	That's the preparation.
1388144	1389620	216	Daniel	0.99999	What do you think, Alexey?
1390520	1399332	217	Alexey	0.99912	That is a beautiful metaphor, and I dig that, except I think I heard Chris say that when you prepare, you may qubit into up or down.
1399386	1402936	218	Alexey	0.85	And this is what I'm lost, because when you comb the carpet, you don't do that.
1403038	1404744	219	Alexey	1	You don't put the footstep on it.
1404782	1406484	220	Alexey	0.56677	In fact, there may not be any footstep.
1406532	1406936	221	Dean	0.99998	Right.
1407038	1410972	222	Alexey	0.63	And this is where I'm missing, I think, in quantum physics as well.
1411026	1422912	223	Alexey	0.99828	If you measure the cause and effect, relationships are broken here for me, if in my act of preparation, I'm opening my canvas to read the message, but I do not know what the message will be, I'm game.
1423046	1432020	224	Alexey	0.99989	But if he's saying that when I prepare, I modify the carpet such that it becomes either up or down, actually not blank, but up or down.
1432090	1433220	225	Alexey	0.60311	Then I'm lost.
1433720	1436852	226	Daniel	1	You have to comb the carpet up or down.
1436986	1438976	227	Daniel	0.9995	There's no blank carpet.
1439088	1443376	228	Daniel	0.94844	So you have an Etch A Sketch.
1443488	1465980	229	Daniel	1	You could either make all the pixels white and then you'd be able to measure a message in the dark or you can make all the message dark or the slate dark, and then you could be able to measure something that was light, but you pick a direction of polarization in your preparation or calibration step so that deviations from that can be the measurement.
1468480	1470700	230	Alexey	0.99989	So you're saying carpet is binary?
1470780	1472160	231	Alexey	0.99939	Carpet doesn't have multiple states.
1472230	1473680	232	Alexey	0.99955	Carpet can only have two states.
1473750	1478304	233	Alexey	0.99998	So if I prepare it, I effectively put it in one of those states.
1478502	1484320	234	Daniel	0.78112	Well, let's say we had the carpet at a 45 degree angle.
1484480	1500410	235	Daniel	0.30865	Mathematically we could describe that as a mixed state, and it may not be the most effective for measuring the movement of people across the carpet, but yeah, you could define it or comb it that way.
1501260	1509130	236	Daniel	0.99908	If it were only a binary, it wouldn't be a qubit then it would be a classical bit, actually.
1510060	1511372	237	Daniel	0.52645	Yeah, under.
1511426	1512350	238	Daniel	0.72014	Go for it.
1513680	1514430	239	Ander	0.76203	Yeah.
1516080	1526850	240	Ander	0.28903	If I recall lecture a couple of slides more, we briefly talked about it like ten minutes ago.
1527380	1534480	241	Ander	0.99991	By preparing, you are choosing an axis and whatever you up or down in that axis.
1534560	1538390	242	Ander	0.57619	Now, that doesn't mean that the environment gets to do its own thing, right?
1541160	1549672	243	Ander	0.42	And superposition of outcomes, but at least you're measuring in that axis, right?
1549726	1554600	244	Ander	0.99858	So it's going to be either up or down in that two pictures.
1557040	1566110	245	Ander	1	I just want to see a few words on screens, on the fine line diagrams and maybe clarify question a little more.
1570440	1571300	246	Daniel	0.93611	Dean.
1573480	1573976	247	Dean	0.69596	On this.
1573998	1575128	248	Dean	0.87149	Really interesting.
1575294	1591032	249	Dean	1	I don't know how metaphorically you could explain the carpet as a wave, but I think once you get away from the it's up or down, that possibility enters the conversation.
1591176	1607292	250	Dean	1	And the only reason I wonder whether or not metaphorically, the wave aspect of that can be included in how you're describing the carpet is that Chris spent quite a bit of time on the all possible paths argument.
1607356	1614588	251	Dean	0.86	And in particular, and I love this, when Alice isn't looking right.
1614694	1620790	252	Dean	0.81087	Well, in that wave equation, how could Alice not be looking?
1624390	1625554	253	Dean	0.47873	That's what gets real.
1625592	1634826	254	Dean	0.99	I mean, Alice could not be looking if it's binary, if it's or up or down, but if it's wave, it's on.
1634888	1637862	255	Dean	0.9092	It's a unitary propagator.
1637926	1648702	256	Dean	0.99962	I'm not sure how she takes her eyes off of this preparation measure thing that's going off all the time.
1648836	1671570	257	Dean	0.53514	So this is actually what I consider to be a feature or an opportunity or an opening in the sense that from a strictly information transfer piece not a mechanical piece now, not a physical thing from an information transfer piece, maybe the carpet can be metaphorically understood as a wave.
1672810	1677842	258	Dean	0.98338	That the eyes of Alice or whoever's doing the preparing and the measuring.
1677906	1678594	259	Dean	0.99991	Bob, Alice.
1678642	1679414	260	Dean	1	I don't care.
1679532	1690170	261	Dean	0.99674	Peaches that there is actually a difference, then between something that is exchanged and something that is informationally transferred.
1690750	1695820	262	Dean	1	And again, I don't think that the four of us here sitting right now are going to resolve that.
1696270	1718098	263	Dean	0.70907	But I wonder if part of the difficulty in this is finding the physical metaphor that explains the theoretical transfer in such a way that both breaks the symmetry and holds it.
1718184	1720094	264	Dean	0.99973	Because again, we're back to gripper and grip.
1720142	1726438	265	Dean	0.99967	We're back to figuring it out and outing the physical figures in the state that we're in.
1726524	1729542	266	Dean	1	And we have to do both at once.
1729676	1733542	267	Dean	0.7286	So again, Daniel, you're the creative guy.
1733596	1737770	268	Dean	1	How do you turn your carpet metaphor into a wave equation?
1738830	1746230	269	Daniel	0.99999	Maybe there's a subwoofer in the room or maybe somebody is waving the carpet.
1746390	1760350	270	Daniel	0.99406	But what you said about what is exchanged and what is transferred, maybe the transfer is the classical component.
1761890	1767038	271	Daniel	0.96	I don't know which one will be exchange or transferred, but one of them is the classical inscription.
1767134	1771362	272	Daniel	0.89664	That's how many gigabytes were written or read to the hard drive.
1771496	1776630	273	Daniel	1	But what's exchanged, let's just say, are the semantics of meaning.
1776970	1792122	274	Daniel	0.5	And given an appropriate Copeparation, maybe only one bit needs to be transferred for the exchange of a message that was already triggered to be set off.
1792256	1802574	275	Daniel	1	And then also, this entire discussion, it kind of strikes me as like the Cartesian duality of our time.
1802772	1813890	276	Daniel	1	But rather than mind and body, it's the physicality of information syntax and the metaphysicality of information semantics.
1814390	1823480	277	Daniel	1	And that's these kind of two worlds with their own physics and metaphysics that we're trying to connect.
1824090	1831670	278	Daniel	0.62	And it's like, similarly well, how does the information world cause something physical?
1832170	1835070	279	Daniel	0.99996	How does the physical cause somethingal?
1835170	1849710	280	Daniel	1	And I think that the entire journey that the course and everyone is on is physics as information processing, those as a qualified and distinguished but minimum of two set.
1849860	1850990	281	Daniel	0.57379	Alexey?
1852130	1852686	282	Alexey	0.74053	Yeah.
1852788	1853806	283	Alexey	0.99993	Thank you so much.
1853908	1854718	284	Alexey	1	Can you hear me?
1854804	1855440	285	Ander	0.78605	Yeah.
1857090	1858106	286	Alexey	0.83492	Thinking out loud?
1858138	1858334	287	Ander	0.99997	Maybe.
1858372	1865058	288	Alexey	0.88304	But I think the way to get closer to understanding in my head is to let go of the metaphor of asking a question, right?
1865144	1870594	289	Alexey	0.97586	So if Alexi is talking to Daniel through zoom and I pose even a closed question, up or down.
1870792	1876886	290	Alexey	0.99985	So I formulated the question and released it into zoom space.
1876988	1880294	291	Alexey	0.93	And then I'm silent and I opened my listening to your answer.
1880412	1884040	292	Alexey	0.75885	But you, Daniel, have agency to say up or down.
1884490	1888138	293	Alexey	1	I do not have any effect on whether you will say up or down.
1888224	1888906	294	Alexey	0.99879	Right?
1889088	1889930	295	Alexey	0.99981	That's the difference.
1890000	1894410	296	Alexey	0.99979	So me asking you a question does not modify the answer.
1894560	1895398	297	Alexey	1	You decide.
1895494	1896566	298	Alexey	0.89427	Alice talking to Bob.
1896598	1900106	299	Alexey	0.99961	Bob has the agency to answer the question, not Alice.
1900298	1902346	300	Alexey	1	And that's where I'm stuck.
1902378	1905950	301	Alexey	0.99996	So I don't know if asking a question continues to be a good metaphor.
1906290	1910000	302	Alexey	0.99746	Preparing the instrument for measurement is maybe better.
1911030	1913550	303	Alexey	0.99135	But actually, Ellis is not asking Bob.
1913630	1915726	304	Alexey	0.98462	Ellis is acting on a qubit.
1915918	1916658	305	Alexey	0.87638	Right.
1916824	1923762	306	Alexey	1	And qubit is is a simple thing that, you know, can can literally physically be up or down, I guess.
1923896	1927890	307	Alexey	0.86	And so that's that's maybe, maybe that's the answer that Ellis is not asking.
1927960	1935690	308	Alexey	0.99916	Bob Ellis does something to the qubit and because qubit can be up or down, then that's no longer asking a question.
1935760	1940460	309	Alexey	0.99914	Asking a question implies your correspondent can tell you anything.
1942270	1960154	310	Daniel	1	When we're dealing with the very sophisticated process of natural language question asking, I think we're dealing with something that's orders of composition above the kind of binary ask.
1960292	1962340	311	Daniel	0.98607	So I agree with that.
1963030	1977302	312	Daniel	0.95434	It's almost like Alice prepares the photoreceptor so its slate is refreshed and then it's the photon or the light emitting object that has the agency to send the photon or not.
1977436	1988262	313	Daniel	0.95	I mean, maybe the preparation occurs and then no one comes back to check whether or not agency was even exerted.
1988406	2012946	314	Daniel	1	And I think when we really focus on the nanoprobe like atomic force microscopy, really tracing with a super fine tip over the surface of something, or scattering X rays, when we really think about the moment of information transfer, we realize like, nothing comes for free.
2013048	2024982	315	Daniel	0.64	And I think that this question asking framework, other than really conveniently rederriving quantum mechanics in 1 hour incredibly helps us understand that we don't get to ask it for free in terms of time.
2025116	2026134	316	Daniel	0.99997	We don't get to ask.
2026172	2027958	317	Daniel	0.99998	It for free in terms of energy.
2028124	2039318	318	Daniel	1	And we don't get to ask free floating questions where the question and or agentic responder are not involved already in a semantics.
2039494	2049310	319	Daniel	0.99985	So I think it's calling attention to the components of an experiment or a question or an opening.
2049970	2062260	320	Daniel	1	But agree that it's not always as simple as a binary question, but in the special simple basal case, it does start there.
2066470	2075010	321	Daniel	0.67731	Do you want to look at any of the participant submitted questions, if there was any that struck your let me finish real quick.
2075080	2078360	322	Ander	0.99	I had like maybe five minutes to wrap this up.
2079370	2083986	323	Ander	0.84	And this, I think, is going to, at least in part, answer one of Dean's concerns.
2084098	2090822	324	Ander	0.99906	So the next thing we should very briefly cover, let's talk a little bit about Holographic screens.
2090966	2097254	325	Ander	1	And also this is the paper on the physical meaning of Holographic principle.
2097302	2101440	326	Ander	0.99466	So let's take a look at also this picture from that paper.
2102130	2120722	327	Ander	0.99995	This is the Holographic boundary and Landauer's principle and all these thermodynamic constraints on information processing necessitate the breakdown of this boundary in terms of free energy extraction sectors, memory sectors and so on.
2120856	2131480	328	Ander	0.78	And by the way, if you read the paragraphs around this picture, there's more details on how the time QRF is induced, but we'll leave that as it is for now.
2133770	2143130	329	Ander	0.86079	Dean, what I meant by this answering your concern, was that you don't see how Alice can take off her eyes from the picture.
2144190	2146634	330	Ander	0.99994	But that's precisely what's going on here, right?
2146752	2157866	331	Ander	0.75917	There's a sector that's being observed, which is a subset of these qubits that are being observed, but presumably she has the freedom to say, hey, this sector.
2157978	2167490	332	Ander	0.99994	Now I declare as my observation sector, this I declare as my memory sector, this I declare as my thermal free energy extraction sector.
2167910	2186046	333	Ander	0.70598	So it is because of these fundamental limits on the amount of information processing, it is not true that she can she doesn't have an idealized Laplacian, if you wish, access to all the degrees of freedom.
2186098	2191722	334	Ander	0.99753	She can only observe, finally, a finite amount of stuff.
2191856	2197870	335	Ander	0.91533	So she is forced to take her eyes off at least part of the system, at least for a while, right?
2197940	2206400	336	Ander	0.99938	Because otherwise all those energy and time constraints that Daniel was just mentioning, they're not you have to abide by those.
2209490	2227720	337	Ander	1	A few things that Chris mentioned in the last lecture when it came to this holographic screen is, well, number one, that all the information exchange is mediated by bits here at the qubits, at this holographic screen.
2228170	2235746	338	Ander	0.99997	This in turn enforces a finiteness in the information transfer, if you wish.
2235778	2240138	339	Ander	0.94322	There is not an infinite amount of information in finite space.
2240224	2264130	340	Ander	1	Even if you were to pack it at Plankian density, which is presumably the limit that black holes achieve, it's still a finite amount of information in a finite amount of so if you have finite ones, you are taking the other is the following.
2265350	2272930	341	Ander	0.63	And again, Chris will deal with this at greater detail in perhaps lecture five, I think maybe four.
2273080	2277554	342	Ander	1	But it's the notion of emergent spacetime, which is that A and B separately.
2277602	2293878	343	Ander	0.99996	So you think of these are presumably the internal degrees of freedom, what's going on inside of a alice, at an abstract level, there may not be a notion of space, but notion of space emerges at the boundary.
2294054	2303040	344	Ander	0.99	And that's not easy to explain, I think, presumably has to do with and stuff like that.
2303730	2317970	345	Ander	0.98	And I don't know the full details myself, but for now, that's one of the key things that Chris mentioned, which is that an agent may not have space, but it may emerge boundary.
2322630	2328486	346	Ander	1	The last thing, and I'm glad that to see that this was mentioned already, so it saves us time.
2328508	2329750	347	Ander	0.55	I don't have to say it again.
2329900	2331110	348	Ander	0.99482	Take us a minute.
2334810	2336938	349	Ander	0.66	And this again answers your can you.
2336944	2340090	350	Daniel	0.55176	Just turn off your video under just so you don't have lag?
2340750	2341354	351	Ander	0.97298	Yeah.
2341472	2341818	352	Ander	0.69005	Thank you.
2341824	2342620	353	Ander	0.84	1 second.
2347070	2347674	354	Ander	0.7042	Yes.
2347792	2349162	355	Ander	0.78839	Can you yeah me.
2349296	2350300	356	Ander	0.95455	Go for it.
2351170	2355054	357	Ander	0.99965	This notion of Feyman diagrams, right?
2355252	2361150	358	Ander	0.99972	So what is this whole thing about unitary evolution or preparation?
2362550	2381218	359	Ander	0.53	The scattering picture as Alice preparing as her of her boundary and writing it into her memory and then measuring it at some point in the future requires that you consider the possible that happened to that preparation.
2381394	2381734	360	Ander	0.77984	Okay.
2381772	2393226	361	Ander	0.99935	So if there's some amount of time passes, you prepared your state at time T, you look at it again at time T plus DT, you have to take into account all.
2393248	2399402	362	Ander	0.85	The possible histories, clearly, of the system, or at least that part of the system.
2399456	2407610	363	Ander	0.79785	Writing it's, just saying, I prepared it here, now it's up to b what happens until the next time I look at it, up to the environment.
2407690	2412766	364	Ander	0.51481	So in that unitary evolution, I consider all the possibilities.
2412878	2422434	365	Ander	0.98921	Right, and that's exactly so.
2422472	2424530	366	Ander	0.65436	Let's just look at the conclusion.
2425990	2428758	367	Ander	0.60183	We will leave it there for now.
2428844	2430630	368	Ander	0.7834	We can open up the discussion.
2431290	2435480	369	Ander	0.99812	So there's two things that are now, where was this?
2439710	2440474	370	Ander	0.99979	Go ahead.
2440592	2444138	371	Dean	0.88907	Yeah, I understand.
2444224	2445660	372	Dean	0.93768	Or I think I understand.
2446590	2454320	373	Dean	0.7	I think I understand that if I'm looking at on or if I'm attending to on, I'm not looking at off.
2455010	2468238	374	Dean	0.9999	What I saw in that wave thing with Federman was I could also be looking at the switch where the two different places of on and off exist.
2468414	2482710	375	Dean	1	And when I'm looking at the entire switch, I'm not looking at one or the other, I'm looking at that basil, as Daniel described, that Basil opportunity of both.
2482860	2495450	376	Dean	0.71	And I think that on that I don't know how that ties in with reference frames, but on that level that says, I'm now looking at all possible in that moment.
2495520	2506570	377	Dean	0.98	I don't think, at least from that perspective, that reference frame I'm zooming into an on or off binary choice decision branch.
2506730	2512420	378	Dean	0.64678	I'm still at that place where the preparation allows for both.
2512950	2517650	379	Dean	0.99962	I'm literally not taking my eyes off at that place.
2517720	2532342	380	Dean	0.99805	So, again, I'm not arguing with you because what you described and the image that you brought up, all that is is bringing it down to a granular level and saying if I'm paying attention to this, I can't be paying attention to that.
2532476	2545820	381	Dean	0.9999	But if I physically, from a transfer perspective, back up so that I can see both possibilities at once, I don't know that I'm taking my eye off of either.
2546270	2548634	382	Dean	0.62465	That's the only thing that I was bringing up.
2548672	2557342	383	Dean	0.99988	Now, of course, Chris will probably hear this and go, dean, you got to go and rethink this whole thing through, which is great because I'm here to learn.
2557476	2575126	384	Dean	0.99964	But again, if I misspoke about what I was trying to say, it wasn't because I don't see those moments when I'm directing my preparation over here.
2575228	2587062	385	Dean	0.76	And that's going to give me one kind of measurement versus if I'm taking in a larger time frame or larger spatial frame or larger holographic screen.
2587116	2591322	386	Dean	0.91139	Like I don't even know how to describe it because I just don't have the words for it yet.
2591376	2593194	387	Dean	0.99962	But there you go.
2593232	2596598	388	Dean	0.66	I just want to be clear that I'm not I don't think I'm confused.
2596694	2605098	389	Dean	0.92	I just want to know the difference between when I'm looking at on or off and when I'm looking at the entire switch.
2605194	2606160	390	Dean	0.65095	That's all.
2607970	2611570	391	Daniel	0.85624	I'll add one point on this slide.
2611990	2620530	392	Daniel	0.53464	It goes back to some of the earliest points that Chris made about the ontological primacy of communication.
2620950	2624440	393	Daniel	0.79058	Space and time arise from communicating agents.
2624970	2631750	394	Daniel	0.6454	Communicating agents are not something that we have to squeeze into an a priori spatial temple framework.
2632170	2638486	395	Daniel	0.99999	So quantum mechanics saying here on the slide is about measurement, not mechanical motion.
2638678	2649680	396	Daniel	0.99998	So we don't need to wait around or speculate as to how from the quote mechanical or physical hard drive measurement arises or happens.
2650130	2663780	397	Daniel	0.58457	We start with the measurement occurring and then different kinds of sophisticated agents can conceptualize of movement through spaces and times.
2664470	2674130	398	Daniel	1	And this also relates to Bayesian mechanics as a mechanics and a physics of movement on information geometric spaces.
2674650	2689910	399	Daniel	0.94	And so the physics can be projected by appropriately prepared agents, but we don't necessarily need to wonder about how that agent fits within a mechanical setting.
2690070	2704640	400	Daniel	1	And I guess this is where humans are with the I am a strange loop girdle escher Bach gripper and gripped mystery of being able to see it multiple ways.
2711730	2714880	401	Daniel	0.75668	Ander, do you want to go to the questions?
2715410	2718818	402	Ander	0.5603	Yeah, let me just say closing remarks here.
2718984	2748726	403	Ander	0.78	I think what Chris is punching line of the paper free energy principle for quantum systems, which is morally speaking, it's similar to relaxation to thermodynamical equilibrium, which is that if you have an isolated bipartite quantum system, a and B are going to turn are going to tend towards reference frame alignment and therefore entanglement.
2748918	2755370	404	Ander	1	And these two things are basically very intimately related.
2755950	2761470	405	Ander	0.99863	By aligning the reference frame culia amb will be driven towards maximal entanglement.
2764290	2770754	406	Ander	0.99883	So should I take a look at the questions and open this?
2770792	2788774	407	Ander	0.50412	Yeah, so so if you guys have access to the Q and A, there's been more questions in the last bringing you guys'attention to a few of them.
2788972	2835894	408	Ander	0.99985	This is where Chris links to the papers of Robelli, which I mentioned earlier in passing when we were talking about the preparation, measurement cycle and the notion of formal time or subjective time, if you wish, as somebody brought up this remark that performance and calculations here you can relate t time to a change in a change in the volume of face space, or more precisely, the amount of available states in the state space, with a log and whatever with respect to the energy.
2836012	2836680	409	Ander	0.998	Right?
2840810	2846794	410	Ander	0.60417	So this restates the idea that we're talking about earlier, right?
2846832	2858270	411	Ander	0.98216	Like your intrinsic subjective time being this DS the eitherative thermal time basically speaking, that is observer dependent.
2859010	2863840	412	Ander	0.60468	So that's a good question to take a look at.
2868150	2869442	413	Ander	0.56396	There's another one.
2869576	2871730	414	Ander	0.99952	What is meant by local free of choice?
2872470	2873842	415	Ander	0.98999	This is a very good answer too.
2873896	2876882	416	Ander	0.99997	Local here means a Sam boundary, right?
2877016	2883090	417	Ander	0.85096	Isolated systems are idealized by definition.
2883170	2886434	418	Ander	0.99969	There's always going to be an observer interacting with an environment.
2886482	2889874	419	Ander	0.99412	So an ISO purely isolated system is an idealization.
2890002	2894266	420	Ander	0.56873	So what local free choice means here is exactly what we said earlier, right?
2894288	2899210	421	Ander	0.99284	That you get to choose the spin axis at the boundary qubits.
2907090	2913790	422	Ander	0.99813	There were some nice questions relating mark of blankets to the scattering picture.
2915410	2918340	423	Ander	0.67619	So this one, for instance, is also worth a look.
2919910	2926222	424	Ander	0.85521	So somebody brought up this very good point about the scattering matrix.
2926366	2934662	425	Ander	0.97323	Scattering matrix is by the way, let's not think about it mathematically, let's think about the picture, right?
2934796	2940806	426	Ander	0.78	You imagine two particles that are interacting and far away they are free, right?
2940828	2944330	427	Ander	0.99946	They are specially separated and interacting free particles.
2944990	2948074	428	Ander	0.55	And somehow at some point they come to interact, right?
2948192	2955600	429	Ander	0.63	And then you have to write all the finite diagrams for all the exchange of bosons or whatever the interaction is.
2956530	2960462	430	Ander	1	And that's how you would compute the amplitudes for the scattering process, right?
2960516	2967940	431	Ander	0.99996	How those two particles that were separated came to interact and then they go off to infinity again.
2968870	2979540	432	Ander	0.66468	Chris here brings up the point that in a sense, how you define a Markov blanket is in the opposite direction, right?
2980150	2984578	433	Ander	0.3535	Marko blanket in at least in the graph theory sense, you start with a node.
2984674	2994298	434	Ander	0.3	The marker blanket is just the set of nodes that separate in terms of conditional probability, that node from everyone else.
2994464	3004214	435	Ander	1	And then you can have edges which are going to be directly coastal network, so acyclic, no cycles directed edges.
3004342	3005760	436	Ander	0.99948	That's how the graph looks.
3007170	3012766	437	Ander	0.83	And you build up essentially you're taking the opposite picture, right?
3012788	3024526	438	Ander	1	You start with a node, which in this case would be the interaction, and then you build up to infinity as opposed to in the scattering picture, which is like you start with particles not interacting at infinity.
3024718	3029960	439	Ander	0.97	You see how they go off to infinity again and then the interaction is in the middle.
3031610	3037640	440	Ander	0.99252	So obviously the answer is a bit more precise, but it's worth taking a look at.
3038410	3046326	441	Ander	0.99	And this is an interesting one too, of a symmetrical input output bandwidth.
3046358	3055722	442	Ander	0.9999	So again, if you think of it as a graph, nothing is constraining you to say that you're going to have more incoming arrows than outcoming arrows into the boundary.
3055786	3056400	443	Ander	0.96379	Right?
3057250	3058430	444	Ander	0.81224	That's just the way it is.
3058500	3063066	445	Ander	0.99818	If you think of it, a graph, there is no symmetry imposed.
3063258	3066750	446	Ander	1	The only natural sense of symmetry would be energy conservation.
3066830	3084678	447	Ander	1	And that's exactly what Chris says here, right, which is that, and I'm not sure myself how you relate it to a conservation of not quite information, but I wouldn't know how to phrase it myself.
3084844	3087206	448	Ander	0.56	I would just take a look at the question.
3087308	3095590	449	Ander	0.85654	But basically, no, there is a priority nothing that necessitates symmetry input output in mark of blankets.
3096090	3116350	450	Ander	0.99996	But if you are to talk about any sort of symmetry, the natural language would not be in terms of incoming versus outcome in arrows, but rather energy conservation, which we saw is a close casting of information transfer, right, because of the minimal requirements for action to rewrite a qubit.
3117650	3138950	451	Ander	0.94	And the last question that I would like to bring your guys'attention to, I mean, all of them are great, but we have finite resources and finite times on internet would be would be this one.
3139020	3139350	452	Ander	0.92694	Okay.
3139420	3141480	453	Ander	1	And I'm not going to go into too much detail.
3142590	3149340	454	Ander	0.99936	But this is again about the local wait 1 second.
3161450	3162806	455	Ander	0.99624	Turn on my camera, by the way.
3162828	3165180	456	Daniel	0.43137	Dino, go for it.
3169880	3176004	457	Daniel	1	And also people can see all the questions on the website, right?
3176042	3177750	458	Daniel	1	And submit their own as well.
3178200	3179750	459	Ander	0.99994	Yes, for sure.
3180520	3185370	460	Ander	0.57152	So now I lost track of the question that I wanted to show you guys.
3186140	3187752	461	Ander	0.96	I think it's this one over here.
3187806	3189720	462	Ander	0.99622	Yes, exactly.
3189790	3190520	463	Ander	0.99792	This one.
3190670	3196572	464	Ander	0.99998	By the way, all of them are good, even this one, the Holographic principle, does it make it easier to compute any physics problems?
3196706	3199564	465	Ander	0.99996	Well, please take a look at Chris's answer.
3199602	3210770	466	Ander	0.99999	But all I can say is that these ideas of holography, I'm not an expert, I'm not a condensed matter physicist, but they're used all over physics nowadays, not necessarily just in high energy.
3211700	3214884	467	Ander	1	I know that condensed matter theorists use them all the time.
3214922	3222532	468	Ander	0.99995	So the answer to this is an emphatic yes, the Holographic, at least Ada Saft is used all over.
3222666	3230890	469	Ander	1	But again, I'm not a physicist myself, so this is the last question I wanted to bring your attention to.
3231980	3264000	470	Ander	0.8	And here Chris, this may be the one worth taking a look at in terms of in order to answer all the earlier speculations that we had about time internal clock, here somebody asks about synchrony and just the perception of time with respect to external clocks, I suppose.
3264340	3278064	471	Ander	0.93	And Chris here answers that at the end of the day, even if you're using an external clock, everything that you perceive outside at the end of the day has to be in terms of an internal clock.
3278192	3285572	472	Ander	0.81933	Any information incoming, you're going to have to make causal sense of it, you're going to have to write it into a memory.
3285716	3300492	473	Ander	0.99988	In terms of an internal clock, you're never going to be able to, so to speak, increase your precision of the passage of time by taking that external clock, even if you think it's more precise than anything you have inside.
3300626	3302928	474	Ander	1	I think that's basically what his answer amounts to.
3303014	3321990	475	Ander	1	And this is morally related to all this frame halting problem stuff where because as a system, you're never going to give an infinitely precise I'm speaking very loosely here an infinitely precise description of yourself.
3322760	3327336	476	Ander	0.92347	You're never going to morally speaking again, that's what it amounts to.
3327358	3346780	477	Ander	0.99996	You're never going to be able to outdo your internal clock by trying to leverage something external like an atomic clock, that even if you think it's more precise, at the end of the day, your own subjective perception of information will depend on internal clocks.
3353290	3355382	478	Ander	0.99625	So we can open up things.
3355436	3361770	479	Ander	0.75807	Any concluding remarks and any other Alexey or Dean or anyone else who may have joined?
3362510	3365100	480	Ander	1	I don't have anything else to say at this point.
3367470	3371358	481	Daniel	0.93	I mean, where or when are we?
3371524	3379390	482	Daniel	0.9994	We had session one with a real big historical overview.
3381110	3404706	483	Daniel	0.99533	Section two, we focused on the Measurability question, which is answered with a question, and we talked about some of the constraints of question asking, namely that it takes time, it takes energy, you have to ask it to somebody or something on an interface, and it has to have a semantic quantum reference frame.
3404898	3417370	484	Daniel	1	And this is dovetailing with a free energy principle, of course, because the free energy principle, as it says in the syllables, to what does the free energy principle apply?
3417520	3418662	485	Daniel	1	And Chris says everything.
3418736	3419630	486	Daniel	0.57585	Measurable.
3419970	3428206	487	Daniel	0.99993	That's why it's a theory of everything that we choose to measure and model, not ontological statements about what is.
3428388	3433460	488	Daniel	1	And then where are we heading into in session three?
3435110	3439410	489	Daniel	0.99999	Have you looked ahead, Ander, or do you want me to read what's in the syllabus?
3439830	3440530	490	Ander	0.99998	Please do.
3440600	3451094	491	Ander	0.92393	Yeah, I think basically my short answer to that, and possibly my full answer also, is that it's just going to take care of the loose ends in this lecture two.
3451212	3464538	492	Ander	0.99996	So this lecture two is a warm up to the real thing, which we need to talk more seriously about reference frames in order to get the precise picture of this quantum measurement process.
3464624	3474954	493	Daniel	0.58444	Yeah, it says that session three will introduce the idea of quantum reference frames and the representation using Hierarchies of binary classifiers.
3475082	3481986	494	Daniel	0.99997	These formal structures provide a semantics for measurement and hence provide the basis for a theory of meaning for interacting agents.
3482168	3493070	495	Daniel	1	The language of QRFs allows a particularly straightforward and intuitive definition of variational free energy, and so allows a fully general quantum formulation of the FEP.
3493230	3501030	496	Daniel	0.99999	We will see that the FEP is a classical limit on the principle of unitarity, the fundamental principle of quantum theory.
3503610	3509750	497	Ander	0.99985	By the way, Danielle, I'm not sure if you're busy, but I just got an email from Chris.
3509830	3514220	498	Ander	1	I think he may be watching us and I think he's just confused about the link.
3515630	3520334	499	Ander	0.98911	Chris, I don't know if you're there still, but do you think it's worth it?
3520372	3523694	500	Ander	0.62654	We send him the link real quick if he can come for a few minutes.
3523812	3524480	501	Ander	0.94212	Yeah.
3526370	3530640	502	Daniel	0.99675	I'll send Chris the zoom link now.
3531010	3535620	503	Daniel	0.79427	Yeah, hold on to your qubit, Chris, we're coming.
3536230	3540738	504	Ander	0.97234	Yeah, so let's give him a few minutes.
3540824	3545506	505	Ander	0.9338	Maybe he's still watching and he'll answer the questions better than I could.
3545608	3550070	506	Dean	0.54468	Well, Daniel is sending him a lifeline.
3551130	3570938	507	Dean	0.99374	Just from the rookie perspective on this session one seemed like there was a big time window, like the historical piece over using an external clock and a timeline.
3571114	3591838	508	Dean	0.99999	This one felt like the parabola and the upper down and the entanglement was almost instantaneous in terms of that plank length that we were really holding up as comparative to that timeline, that chronological timeline.
3592014	3601526	509	Dean	1	And so I'm guessing that now that we've established those two as different, where does that go?
3601628	3605880	510	Dean	0.99618	But again, that's just the rookies view of things.
3611310	3612278	511	Daniel	0.99185	Hey, Chris.
3612374	3613020	512	Daniel	0.99773	Welcome.
3613790	3614682	513	Chris	0.82409	Yeah, hi.
3614736	3627760	514	Chris	0.99989	This is a very interesting discussion and it's given me some pointers as to what to emphasize at the beginning of session three.
3628690	3644980	515	Chris	0.99999	But I can say in response to Dean's question that the time when Alice isn't looking is the time during which Bob is making his measurement and then his next preparation step.
3645910	3663050	516	Chris	0.51022	So if you consider again that slide that shows sort of the Feynman representation of what's happening as this unitary flow, that's what Bob is doing.
3663120	3676160	517	Chris	0.83	And I think Ander said that from Alice's point of view, bob is just some quantum system and she's banged on that system by asking a question.
3677010	3690722	518	Chris	1	And now that system is doing something or other that she can't see until Bob bangs on his side of the screen and she gets some information.
3690856	3700440	519	Chris	1	By making a measurement, she may be not looking for a very short period of time.
3701930	3702630	520	Chris	0.73195	Right.
3702780	3705350	521	Chris	0.99799	According to her internal clock.
3705690	3711660	522	Chris	0.99992	She's not looking for just the time it takes for one of her internal ticks to take place.
3713150	3722486	523	Chris	0.99993	But in general, we're not saying anything about how long that time is, right?
3722528	3749800	524	Chris	0.99871	If you think of this in a scattering theory way, then we're talking about the time between two protons leaving the rings on the Large Hadron Collider to the time that all the stuff that comes out of their collision is measured by the detectors, which is a nanosecond or something like that, some very short period of time.
3752890	3769370	525	Chris	0.94723	So just think of that interval as the measure of the intrinsic time dependence, external time dependence of the interaction.
3769710	3772974	526	Chris	0.93774	Someone has to do something and then someone else has to do something.
3773012	3780030	527	Chris	0.97	And there's a gap between what the first person does and what they see in response.
3781890	3794290	528	Chris	0.86362	Let's see what's the other question the other central question that came up today was the question of why observing something requires action.
3794870	3800280	529	Chris	1	And of course, in the classical picture, observing something doesn't require any action at all.
3802250	3803960	530	Chris	1	The event just happens.
3804890	3819660	531	Chris	1	And this is the fundamental, if you will, distinction between classical and quantum theory is that making an observation in quantum theory is taking an action on the world.
3820590	3837330	532	Chris	1	And there's a lovely metaphor that's not correct in detail but it's very useful, I think, conceptually which heisenberg came up with to try to explain his uncertainty principle to his classical colleagues.
3837990	3845010	533	Chris	0.7423	He said, look, suppose I'm trying to see a very small particle and measure its motion.
3847030	3853362	534	Chris	1	I have to have a microscope to see this particle and to measure its motion.
3853426	3854966	535	Chris	0.99	I need to light it up.
3854988	3856646	536	Chris	0.71	I need to shine some light on it.
3856748	3862780	537	Chris	0.5	And those photons of light are actually impacting the thing I'm trying to see.
3863790	3871020	538	Chris	0.50938	So the act of observation itself requires banging something into an object.
3872610	3882320	539	Chris	0.59	And when we're just looking out at the world, it's the sun that's banging the light into the object, not us.
3882690	3892340	540	Chris	0.99963	But we can sort of merge those two systems together because it's the sun that's taking the action that lets us get some information.
3893110	3899160	541	Chris	0.99478	But the sun is perturbing the things that we're looking at by banging photons into them.
3901210	3918874	542	Chris	0.65	And I think that picture of Heisenberg's is what he used to actually derive the uncertainty principle in terms of momentum and position, because banging something into something is transferring momentum to it.
3918912	3931674	543	Chris	0.94902	Photons transfers the momentum to the tiny particle in the microscope, and that perturbs its position on the microscope stage, which is precisely what heisenberg is trying to measure.
3931802	3935970	544	Chris	0.99881	So that's his point in that analogy.
3936550	3940238	545	Chris	0.52301	Observation itself always takes action.
3940334	3948514	546	Chris	1	And that's why observation and preparation are duals in quantum theory, because they each require a minimum one unit of action.
3948642	3956120	547	Chris	0.98	And I think, Ander, you said the duality can be thought of in terms of time invariance, and that's exactly correct.
3956890	3961346	548	Chris	0.83805	Preparation is just measurement run backwards and vice versa.
3961458	3983390	549	Ander	0.75	And if you let me say a few words, I think this also answers my own confusion and the one that Alexey the question that Alexi posed earlier, which is this duality between preparation and measurement in your picture that you're bringing up Chris with heisenberg by shining photons on particle that I'm trying to observe.
3985030	3990882	550	Ander	0.99701	These pictures of preparation and measurement are dual because in doing so, I'm constraining the system.
3990936	3993220	551	Ander	0.99178	In trying to measure it, I'm constraining it.
3995030	3999126	552	Ander	0.99737	In me trying to gather information by shining photons on it.
3999228	4001862	553	Ander	0.99996	What I'm really doing is I'm constraining it.
4001916	4008438	554	Ander	0.88771	I'm just saying you can only take this moment or position.
4008604	4009720	555	Ander	0.99976	Would that be correct?
4012270	4012778	556	Chris	0.78781	Yeah.
4012864	4023790	557	Chris	0.9995	In fact, in the microscope example, it's particularly clear you're bouncing a photon off of the object, and then it's that photon that you're detecting.
4025410	4026160	558	Chris	0.69136	Right.
4026930	4031646	559	Chris	0.99999	There was one other question that can be answered quickly.
4031748	4045186	560	Chris	0.99997	It was the question about what's the reference frame that Alice is using when she's measuring up or down, measuring her spin up or down.
4045368	4056262	561	Chris	1	And of course, there are several reference frames involved here, so let's work inwards in a real system.
4056396	4057574	562	Chris	0.98841	Alice is sitting here.
4057612	4070070	563	Chris	0.99857	She's got a Stern Girlock apparatus, which is a vertical magnet apparatus, and she's measuring the spin of an electron that's traveling through this Stern Girlock device.
4070230	4084590	564	Chris	0.86	And what the Stern Girlock device does is orient the spin with a magnetic field that's not homogeneous, so it ends up pointing physically up as it comes through the apparatus.
4085590	4089614	565	Chris	0.99966	So how is that apparatus oriented?
4089662	4093250	566	Chris	0.99	I mean, what defines the up direction for that apparatus?
4093590	4101880	567	Chris	0.58698	Well, in the practical setting, what defines that apparatus orientation is the Earth's gravitational field.
4102330	4103080	568	Chris	0.63652	Right.
4103530	4109078	569	Chris	0.99978	We're here in the laboratory, and the Earth's gravitational field tells us what direction is down.
4109164	4119974	570	Chris	0.88866	It's toward the center of the Earth, and so up is away from the center of the Earth, and that's what defines the axis for the apparatus, which is a great big piece of metal.
4120022	4123680	571	Chris	0.99999	So it's very responsive to the gravitational field.
4124610	4127242	572	Chris	0.87494	So now we can ask about Alice.
4127306	4127534	573	Chris	0.99229	Right.
4127572	4135890	574	Chris	0.85874	Alice is also embedded in this gravitational field, and she also can detect the gravitational field.
4135960	4143406	575	Chris	0.99999	She can tell which way is down toward the center of the Earth by the force acting on her feet.
4143598	4148230	576	Chris	0.71	And that measurement is taking place in Alice's brain.
4148570	4160810	577	Chris	0.99907	So in Alice's brain, there's a representation of which way is up, and that's the internal reference frame of Alice that lets her do the experiment.
4161630	4175054	578	Chris	0.96086	If she was freely floating in space, but the apparatus was anchored to the gravitational field, she wouldn't be able to tell that it was anchored to the gravitational field.
4175172	4187650	579	Chris	0.98058	That's Einstein's point that Einstein makes in all of those experiments where he has observers flying around in spacecraft that they have to have their own reference frame.
4189510	4194500	580	Chris	0.97319	What Einstein didn't emphasize was that reference frame is in their head.
4194870	4197220	581	Chris	0.44333	It's encoded by their nervous system.
4198550	4217740	582	Chris	0.66252	So I think it was Daniel who said this exactly correctly, that the physical object in her head, the the actual neural network that tells her which way the gravitational field is, is itself a semantic object.
4218670	4224750	583	Chris	0.98146	That's what gives the word up and down meaning for Alice.
4225490	4227914	584	Chris	0.99999	What do I mean when I say the word meaning?
4228042	4230510	585	Chris	0.56	I mean, it lets her take some action.
4232850	4239086	586	Chris	0.94711	Semantics boils down to actionability if it gives things significance.
4239278	4259160	587	Chris	0.75	And this was the point that Bateson was making when he said, differences that make a difference for an organism, something is meaningful if it actually makes a difference for what I can do in this world that I'm trying to survive in.
4260730	4262806	588	Chris	0.99708	So I'll leave it at that.
4262908	4268550	589	Chris	0.99836	But this is very useful for leading off the next session.
4268630	4271850	590	Chris	0.99996	So thank you very much for all that discussion.
4272830	4273578	591	Daniel	0.99977	Awesome.
4273744	4274326	592	Daniel	0.99993	Thank you.
4274368	4281790	593	Ander	1	I guess if I could say one thing here is that let me scroll back up to the three points early in the slides.
4282530	4289982	594	Ander	0.99345	Differences that make a difference would tell you that you require action to perturb a system and measure.
4290126	4299650	595	Ander	1	And then the semantics or the contextuality that may be encoded in the nervous system would tell you what is the difference that is being made.
4299800	4301026	596	Ander	0.99513	Would that be correct?
4301208	4301986	597	Chris	0.99707	Yeah.
4302168	4302994	598	Chris	0.52461	Right.
4303192	4305540	599	Chris	0.99972	What tells you that there's a difference there?
4305910	4309846	600	Chris	0.99877	It's what you're able to detect and represent internally.
4309918	4315542	601	Daniel	0.65604	It's almost like step one, do differently.
4315686	4319018	602	Daniel	0.99996	Step two, you have to ask it to a different thing.
4319184	4328960	603	Daniel	1	And then three, you need the semantic frame that makes A and B different differences all the way down.
4330850	4337774	604	Daniel	0.99981	Well, we will transcribe this and fix the few patchy moments ender.
4337822	4350820	605	Daniel	0.68855	We'll work together on updating the transcript so that everybody who wants to be well prepared for the measurement of the third lecture will be absolutely in place.
4353910	4355166	606	Daniel	0.99976	Thank you, Chris, for joining.
4355198	4359150	607	Daniel	0.9988	That's a fun cap to this discussion.
4359310	4361338	608	Chris	0.99132	So, all right, thank you.
4361424	4362490	609	Daniel	0.88058	See you all next time.
4362560	4362790	610	Ander	0.96312	Bye.
