4410	34600	00:04	You. Hello and welcome everyone. It's July 13, 2023. We're here in physics as information processing with the third lecture by Chris Fields. Check out the course website, Coda Document, where you can submit questions. Register if you want to participate in one of the discussion sections.	This lecture is part of a series covering information processing	Physons as Information Processing 3
36410	221330	00:36	 Physics as Information Processing, session Three, which is about quantum reference frames. What we'll talk about today is what reference frames are in general, how they make observations and actions meaningful. And then we will talk about the free energy principle.

223510	1236802	03:43	The idea that physics involves reference frames goes back to Galileo. In the 90s it was realized that a reference frame actually consists of a physical object. This led to the realization that reference frames as quantum systems are unique. And this has an important consequence for physics.

1236866	1434278	20:36	The boundary is where classical information gets written in this purely quantum theoretic formalism. The rest of its boundary gets devoted to extracting free energy from the environment. Any system has to make a decision about how they're going to use energy. Course grading memory is the solution.

1434444	2163690	23:54	Making measurements costs energy and recording memories costs energy. We have to make decisions about what QRS to use at what time. As soon as one has too many sensory and motor capabilities to run all at the same time, given your energy budget you end up being compartmentalized.

2164350	2357510	36:04	As a system becomes more complex, it has to have more internal states. Putting in extra entropy makes the environment's behavior even harder to predict. The FEP by itself will drive the development of systems with larger and larger complexity. This has enormous implications for evolutionary theory.

2360270	2630720	39:20	How do we manage to largely share a QRF while escaping, becoming entangled? This is a question that's largely been ignored in physics because physicists have tended to ignore language. Next time, we'll focus on how we describe observers that are both interacting with the quantum system and communicating classically in some language.	Language is a complex QRF that we basically share	Quantum entanglement and language
2633330	2987330	43:53	When you have a trivial agent on one side, what exactly does it mean to say that you're interacting thermally? We're only really interested in systems that aren't interacting only purely thermally with their environments. These challenges where noise for one quantum cognitive agent might be signal for another are the challenges that we want to address.	A system that only interacts thermally with its environment is called entanglement	Interacting thermally with a quantum system
2990390	3228374	49:50	Only in the last several years has the quantum free energy principle relationship come into light. The connection was made based on the analogy between a Markov blanket and a Holographic screen. What does it mean to consider physical processes topologically rather than geometrically?

3228422	3427730	53:48	Can a system extract more energy from some bits than it has to use to modify the states of other bits? Can the heat exhaust informationally be useful for another agent somehow? How do we talk about an environment that includes some specified or preferred systems that are treated as other agents?

3430900	3666930	57:10	In classical thermodynamics there's always the assumption that there's a big environment out there the rest of the universe. Any machine has to dissipate entropy as it runs to fill up this kind of arbitrary sink of entropy. Entropy is always defined relative to some observer, some division, some boundary.
