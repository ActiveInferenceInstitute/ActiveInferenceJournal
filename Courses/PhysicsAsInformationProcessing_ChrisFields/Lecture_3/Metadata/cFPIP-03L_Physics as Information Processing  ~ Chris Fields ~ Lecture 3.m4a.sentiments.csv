4410	4960	A	0.546256959438324	You.
6930	8462	B	0.915437638759613	Hello and welcome everyone.
8596	11230	B	0.8703495860099792	It's July 13, 2023.
11380	17818	B	0.8656760454177856	We're here in physics as information processing with the third lecture by Chris Fields.
17914	31474	B	0.8959972262382507	So please check out the course website, Coda Document, where you can submit questions, check out the recordings and descriptions of all sessions, and register if you want to participate in one of the discussion sections.
31602	34600	B	0.97446209192276	So thank you again, Chris, to you.
36410	44330	A	0.9357588291168213	Thank you and welcome to Physics as Information Processing, session Three, which is about quantum reference frames.
45470	67490	A	0.8907759189605713	So in this course, we've talked about quantum information theory, which we characterized as a general theory that describes the exchange of information, exchange of finite information between two finite agents that are separated by some boundary.
67830	77330	A	0.8200309872627258	And we emphasize that this is a topological theory, not a geometric theory, so it makes no assumptions about an embedding spacetime.
79050	110830	A	0.9148679375648499	And last time we showed how to characterize this boundary of script B as an array of N, some finite N quantum bits or qubits, and how to characterize the interaction of the agents A and B with the boundary as an alternating cycle of preparing and measuring the qubits in this array.
111410	120130	A	0.8686581254005432	And we showed that their interaction could be represented as a sum of operators, each of which act on just one of the qubits.
121350	136038	A	0.9157067537307739	And we also talked about the need for each of the agents A and B to choose a reference frame for their interaction with the qubits that defined which way was up.
136204	162590	A	0.8800551295280457	So what the orientations of the qubits meant and emphasized that the two observers A and B could choose different reference frames, so different ways of measuring and preparing their qubits that use different meanings for the idea of up for each qubit.
163570	179490	A	0.7175959944725037	And we ended the last session with a pointer forward toward the quantum formulation of the free energy principle, which can be stated as the claim that interacting systems behave in a way that aligns their reference frames.
180490	199014	A	0.8783422708511353	And pointed out at that time that what this means is that the two agents A and B approach entanglement asymptotically, and that therefore the FEP is a classical limit of the principle of unitarity, which is the core principle of quantum theory.
199062	202540	A	0.8686743378639221	So we'll see in this session why this is true.
204130	221330	A	0.8347188234329224	So what we'll talk about today is what reference frames are in general, how they make observations and actions meaningful, so how they give physics a semantics, and then we'll talk about the free energy principle.
223510	225650	A	0.8371698260307312	So what is a reference frame?
226550	241160	A	0.7926898002624512	The idea that physics involves reference frames goes back at least to Galileo, but was probably familiar well before that, just not formalized in the way that Galileo formalized it.
242270	247050	A	0.7901925444602966	So the key idea can be thought of in terms of motion.
247550	259738	A	0.7479774355888367	And you're all familiar, for example, with riding a bicycle or driving a car and seeing the world as if it's passing by you at some velocity, with some velocity.
259914	264830	A	0.8047678470611572	And of course, with respect to the world you're passing by it with some velocity.
265810	280802	A	0.8821911811828613	And this idea that velocity is not absolute but that's relative to some observer who measures it in some reference frame is the foundation for theories of relativity.
280866	298410	A	0.8800764679908752	So Galileo developed his theory of relativity which basically was just a way of converting from classical velocities measured by one observer to classical velocities measured by another observer that was moving with respect to the first one.
298560	317490	A	0.817996084690094	And this provided the foundation for Einstein's theories of relativity which modified Galileo's by adding the concept that the observers have to change exchange information and can only exchange it at the speed of light which is finite.
319990	324660	A	0.8609105944633484	So this idea in physics has a long history.
325110	332040	A	0.8654059767723083	Of course, the core idea is that measurements are always with respect to something or other.
332490	338870	A	0.8427419066429138	And the something or other is a reference frame and different agents can choose different reference frames.
339290	341494	A	0.7438150644302368	And this idea is very old.
341612	350170	A	0.8813639879226685	Here we have a picture of anubis choosing a feather as the reference frame with which to measure the heart of the pharaoh.
350590	354906	A	0.8581677675247192	So this goes back to well before the common era.
354938	357950	A	0.8860137462615967	This is about 2000 BCE.
358370	387750	A	0.7948760390281677	So this is a very old idea that's been elaborated over the centuries as science has developed and in the fairly big change in how this idea was thought about occurred in classical physics reference frames were always thought of as mathematical abstractions and an observer and a reference frame were more or less identified by Galileo.
388250	403210	A	0.8361873626708984	And that identification is carried forward into Einstein who thinks about observers, for example, sitting on photons and observers in spaceships and observers riding on railroad trains and this sort of thing.
403280	408720	A	0.8258439302444458	And always that just means think of a reference frame that's doing something or other.
409570	433350	A	0.8144078850746155	So a reference frame in classical physics is essentially just a coordinate system and these abstract coordinate systems can be employed in thought experiments and so they are a way to illustrate classical intuitions about motion.
434490	447002	A	0.8529178500175476	And in the 90s, as quantum information theory developed it was realized that a reference frame actually consists of a physical object.
447136	454250	A	0.795581579208374	I mean, even in the picture from the Egyptian tomb the reference frame is a physical feather.
455490	462554	A	0.8564040660858154	And that means that the reference frame itself is described by quantum theory.
462602	464560	A	0.7905672788619995	It's some quantum system.
465810	486950	A	0.8427473902702332	And if you think about reference frames that are familiar for example, meter sticks for measuring distance or clocks for measuring time or gyroscopes or batteries or even the Earth's gravitational fields which typically defines up for us those are all physical objects that can be described by quantum theory.
487770	500490	A	0.8749243021011353	Well, this was an important insight because it led to the realization that reference frames as quantum systems are unique.
501550	505200	A	0.6386488676071167	And uniqueness in quantum theory is very strong.
506610	514080	A	0.6317923665046692	There's the no Cloning theorem which states that you can't reproduce exactly reproduce any unknown quantum state.
515730	523074	A	0.8626779317855835	And that applies to reference frames because they encode what Bartlett et al.
523112	533270	A	0.6111237406730652	In that paper called non fungible information which just means information that can't be completely represented in any finite bit string.
534010	538520	A	0.5864607691764832	So unless you know the state of a reference frame, you can't clone it.
539290	555946	A	0.8262442946434021	Since these reference frames encode more than any bit string's worth of information in their quantum phases, they're unique and their states are unknown.
556138	567726	A	0.6763387322425842	And the consequence of this is that if Alice wants Bob to use her reference frame to make a measurement, she can't just send him a description.
567918	571410	A	0.83748859167099	She has to actually send the reference frame.
572390	591350	A	0.6577670574188232	And this has an important consequence for physics because it makes all replicate measurements approximate because observers obviously aren't using exactly the same physical objects as their reference frames.
591790	605630	A	0.7967946529388428	But there's a deeper implication of this, which is that Alice's ultimate rock bottom reference frame is actually implemented by her body, by her brain.
606690	618426	A	0.666969358921051	And using any external reference frame requires having this internal reference frame that makes the external reference frame meaningful and usable.
618538	623902	A	0.76270592212677	So, for example, this thing is a piece of a meter stick, a third of a meter stick.
624046	630790	A	0.8719006180763245	But for me to use it to make measurements, I have to actually have some concept of distance.
631130	635400	A	0.7936004400253296	And that concept of distance is implemented by my nervous system.
636170	641990	A	0.8659453988075256	And that implementation is my reference frame for length.
642830	648598	A	0.8201403617858887	And it's what gives meaning to any external measurement of length.
648774	659600	A	0.7052419185638428	It's what makes my measurements of length actionable by me using my effectors or action capabilities, whatever they are.
660210	667730	A	0.7859259843826294	So my internal reference frames are what make information I get from the world actionable.
668230	675694	A	0.8438018560409546	And in Bates and sense of differences that make a difference, actionability is the core of semantics.
675822	679720	A	0.5975803136825562	Something is meaningful if I can do something about it.
680090	693990	A	0.8663848042488098	So this idea that we all contain embodied reference frames gives physics a semantics by giving observers a semantics.
694150	695580	A	0.7164117097854614	And this is new.
696590	706030	A	0.6781773567199707	This is an idea that never really appeared in physics before that measurements automatically had to have some kind of semantics.
706610	711550	A	0.8041384220123291	But reference frames give semantics to measurements.
713730	717410	A	0.8689715266227722	So here's an example of an embodied reference frame.
717990	723266	A	0.8832995891571045	This is the reference frame that bacteria use for chemotaxis I.
723288	723522	A	0.547865092754364	E.
723576	733830	A	0.7959219813346863	To move toward molecules in the environment that they like, like sugars and to move away from molecules that they don't like, like acids.
734250	739142	A	0.6870874166488647	And it's been worked out in great detail over decades of experimental work.
739196	741190	A	0.5133370161056519	And this is a rough schematic.
742350	745130	A	0.7351328134536743	The reference frame has three parts.
746590	753530	A	0.7423083186149597	There's the measurement part, which is conveniently located in the front of the bacterium.
754050	757950	A	0.8629039525985718	And it consists of a bunch of receptors that probe the environment.
758450	764346	A	0.8676435947418213	And they can bind molecules, which are called ligands, out in the environment.
764538	770250	A	0.8818992376327515	And when they bind them, they send a signal into the back of the bacterium.
770330	783830	A	0.8154959678649902	And it turns out that there's a little miniature reference frame attached directly to these ligands which is this r and B system which control the ligands, not the ligands, the receptor sensitivity.
784890	800170	A	0.8744522333145142	Then the back of the reference frame is the action component and it consists of a set of molecules that control a motor, a molecular motor, that drives the flagella on the bacteria.
800830	807390	A	0.845600426197052	And the flagellum allows it to swim forwards or turn in some other direction.
808050	816640	A	0.8411731123924255	And depending on how it spins, the creature either goes in the direction of something it likes or it stops and turns around.
817430	832760	A	0.8780620694160461	And the stuff in the middle is a little molecular feedback loop that represents the amount of ligand in the environment that the bacterium expects to see.
833130	842410	A	0.8983357548713684	So this is the middle of the reference frame and it defines the default value for what the bacterium is observing in its environment.
843150	859760	A	0.8227157592773438	And if you're thinking in terms of the free energy principle or Bayesian inference, then you'll immediately see the concentration of this molecule is encoding a prior probability, the bacterium's prior probability for what its environment is like.
860450	871300	A	0.5017979741096497	And the zero point, the default value of that encoding, is the ligand concentration in which the bacterium does nothing.
872310	890710	A	0.8535881638526917	So a QRF in general can be characterized as an expected value, which is here the concentration of this molecule p y phosphorylated plus a bunch of computation, which is all the rest of the things in this diagram.
891950	897130	A	0.5145061612129211	So this is a very simple QRF that's embodied by a bacteria.
897470	908670	A	0.8231829404830933	Here's a more complicated QRF that's embodied by eukaryotic cells, or more complicated cells like our cells.
909170	917070	A	0.7156597375869751	And this is the reference frame that makes decisions about whether cells are going to divide.
918150	932790	A	0.8661662340164185	So on the top you see the cell's membrane, and there are all sorts of receptors sticking out of it that detect hormones and neurotransmitters and growth factors and this, that, and the other thing, many of which are produced by other cells.
933610	955710	A	0.8673509359359741	And those receptors communicate via a lot of chemistry with the nucleus, which is contained in another membrane and so serves as, in a sense, the outside upon which the reference frame is acting.
956130	963770	A	0.8798182606697083	And what this reference frame does is control the transcription of large numbers of molecules from DNA.
963850	967586	A	0.845273494720459	So it basically controls what proteins the cell is making.
967768	974530	A	0.8461014032363892	And those proteins end up doing something like restructuring the cytoplasm and actually driving cell division.
975190	987030	A	0.9085962772369385	And the stuff in the middle of this reference frame, which I've labeled the integrative center, are three molecules called RAF, mech and ERC.
987450	993450	A	0.6869219541549683	And they're connected by positive by bi directional feedback loops.
993950	1004300	A	0.5948923826217651	And they basically negotiate the default value of the environment at which the cell does nothing.
1005330	1014970	A	0.9038179516792297	So they're the middle of the reference frame that represents the cell's expectation values about what's going on in its environment.
1015130	1020754	A	0.7931762337684631	So you can imagine now what reference frames encoded by our nervous system look like.
1020792	1035350	A	0.5820026397705078	They're extremely complicated and exist at multiple scales, from the scale of molecules in cells to the scale of large scale connections between parts of our brains.
1037370	1039960	A	0.5010545253753662	So how do we represent all this stuff?
1041050	1047020	A	0.5063703656196594	There are many ways to do this, but this is a particularly simple way.
1048350	1068370	A	0.8731712698936462	It assumes that whatever's in the middle, which is here called C prime is the most general thing that the inputs can give information to and the most general thing that can give information to the outputs.
1069030	1086070	A	0.6826030015945435	And most general here has a category theoretic definition so it can be stated in a way that's equivalent across many different specific mathematical forms.
1086570	1095158	A	0.7925193905830383	But if you're familiar with neural networks, this will look to you a lot like the skeleton of a variational auto encoder.
1095334	1097660	A	0.580887496471405	And that's basically what it is.
1098910	1121620	A	0.541757345199585	And I don't want to deal with this formalism except to say that it exists and is very convenient, except to say that we can attach this kind of formal diagram as a representation of a QRF to our representation of the boundary between two interacting agents.
1122550	1134070	A	0.8624737858772278	And we can use these formal structures to drive the measurement operators that actually implement physical changes on this boundary.
1135530	1146646	A	0.8885678052902222	And I'll represent this whole business with just a triangle labeled Q for some QRF that's attached to the boundary.
1146838	1160830	A	0.8553165197372437	And we can use this simple notation then to investigate what sorts of structures one gets when one starts to think about systems as implementing specific QRFs.
1162290	1169970	A	0.6309550404548645	And here's the structure of the minimal system that we can really think of as an interesting observer.
1170870	1201078	A	0.8750880360603333	And this is a system that has some QRF that I've called E that looks at its environment, the part of its environment that it can actually observe and act on, and it defines a sector of the boundary which mathematically is just the image of this Qrfe that the system can manipulate.
1201174	1208560	A	0.8260276913642883	So this is the part of the environment or the part of the boundary that the system actually sees and can do something about.
1209890	1227380	A	0.8160248398780823	And for this observer to be interesting, it needs to be able to detect the difference between what it sees now and what it saw just then so that it can decide whether to take some action or other.
1227750	1236802	A	0.891692578792572	So it needs a memory and that requires another QRF that has some allocated piece of the boundary recall.
1236866	1244570	A	0.8624427318572998	The boundary is where classical information gets written in this purely quantum theoretic formalism.
1245870	1250620	A	0.8766712546348572	So it needs a memory sector that that QRF can act on.
1251470	1266000	A	0.8511690497398376	And then in order to do this computation and specifically in order to write information to the boundary, in order to actually flip bits on the boundary, it needs free energy.
1266630	1279890	A	0.5246575474739075	So the rest of its boundary gets devoted to extracting free energy from the environment and exhausting free energy, waste heat, in other words, into the environment.
1280050	1284600	A	0.4997626543045044	And so it has this nice little thermodynamic cycle that drives everything else.
1285770	1304800	A	0.837212324142456	And finally, in order to tell now from just a second ago the information in memory, it needs a clock that marks the information in memory as not current, so as past information.
1305730	1318900	A	0.8223043084144592	And if it can store multiple memory records, it needs to be able to count and say this piece of remembered information is actually more recent than that piece over there.
1319510	1327490	A	0.8899703621864319	So it has to implement a little internal clock, and that clock is its internal time QRF.
1327830	1331058	A	0.6892464756965637	And we've seen that QRFs act on boundaries.
1331154	1335320	A	0.6394526362419128	This clock acts on a boundary, but it doesn't act on B.
1335690	1353050	A	0.8933839201927185	It acts on an internal boundary that's essentially the boundary between it the clock and the points at the ends of these QRFs that actually encode information that's either read from the environment or written to the environment.
1354050	1372130	A	0.823489785194397	So already this minimal observer has a little bit of hierarchical structure, which is that its clock has to, in some sense, be higher up in the hierarchy than the parts, the QRFs that interact directly with the environment.
1373590	1384950	A	0.6269136667251587	So if you have a structure like this, you face a metabolic trade off for a fixed amount of energy that you can extract from the environment.
1385290	1393740	A	0.7208734154701233	You can allocate it either into learning more about the environment or remembering more about what you learned before.
1396510	1402170	A	0.7788900136947632	So any system has to make this decision about how they're going to use energy.
1402240	1405758	A	0.8577181696891785	Are they going to devote it to learning more or remembering more.
1405924	1409050	A	0.7308788299560547	And your laptop makes that decision.
1409210	1411390	A	0.5479262471199036	Memory is cheap for your laptop.
1412050	1413770	A	0.7484930157661438	Your brain makes that decision.
1413850	1416390	A	0.8430100679397583	Memory is much more expensive for your brain.
1416570	1419102	A	0.7746701836585999	And all cells have to make that decision.
1419246	1426142	A	0.7438868284225464	And the universal solution to this trade off is course grading memory.
1426286	1426882	A	0.5757660269737244	I e.
1426936	1430878	A	0.6276913285255432	Remembering things in less detail than you saw them in the beginning.
1431054	1432710	A	0.832531213760376	Aguirre you have a comment?
1433530	1434278	C	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
1434444	1437074	C	0.7378162145614624	I wanted to ask a question now before it gets too late.
1437122	1452630	C	0.879382848739624	So two or three slides ago, when we were looking at the diagram of the coconut diagrams, I was wondering if the classifiers identified with measurement and preparation.
1452710	1466602	C	0.9089637398719788	Those correspond to sensory and action degrees of freedom in the earlier picture with the bacteria and the classifier in the middle in that picture, would it correspond to the default chemical concentration?
1466746	1468480	A	0.5558730363845825	That yes, exactly.
1469010	1470586	C	0.8497673273086548	Okay, perfect.
1470708	1471380	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1474150	1478770	A	0.8361035585403442	That crossing point in the middle is specifically where the default is encoded.
1479930	1482360	A	0.8563271164894104	Thank you for pointing that out.
1485230	1491020	A	0.8083128929138184	Okay, so let's follow the consequences of this metabolic issue.
1493150	1508586	A	0.504243791103363	If you have a system that's a little bit smarter than our minimal system that can actually detect and measure the states of objects, it has to do even more work because it has to encode even more QRFs.
1508778	1514686	A	0.8878206610679626	So think of measuring the state of some object like a volt meter in a laboratory.
1514878	1522710	A	0.6833329796791077	If I tell you to go into the lab and tell me what the voltmeter is reading, then the first thing you have to do is find the voltmeter.
1523050	1532170	A	0.8645954728126526	And your process of finding the voltmeter is independent of your process of reading what it's actually saying on its dial.
1533150	1545840	A	0.8775062561035156	So in order to measure the state of an object, you have to have two QRFs one that lets you find the object, and then the other that lets you measure the state of interest of the object.
1546370	1562820	A	0.8793864250183105	And we call these the R sector for reference that lets you find the object and the P sector for pointer because old instruments used to have pointers on dials that read analog numbers.
1566830	1596898	A	0.8414924740791321	But what thinking about object identification tells you is that every object that you can identify leads to having to sector both the informative part of your boundary and the memory part of your boundary into two new sectors one to store information about object identification and one to store information about the states of those objects.
1597074	1600310	A	0.5403078198432922	So this requires much more metabolism.
1601210	1605234	A	0.5273352265357971	And again, the solution is coarse grain.
1605362	1610970	A	0.8565475940704346	Typically, what we coarse grain is our memory of the object that we've identified.
1612750	1616250	A	0.8098009824752808	So what does this do to systems?
1619070	1628240	A	0.5266060829162598	Because making measurements costs energy and recording memories costs energy.
1629330	1635586	A	0.8332988619804382	We have to make decisions about what QRS to use at what time.
1635688	1645250	A	0.7273104786872864	Given our finite energy budgets, we can't look at the world with all of our measurement capabilities at the same time because it's too expensive.
1646410	1675546	A	0.7114413380622864	And now we see the effect of a theorem in quantum information theory which is that if two QRFs can't be deployed simultaneously for whatever reason that corresponds to them not commuting as operators and if they don't commute as operators, they have to be implemented by compartments that are separable.
1675658	1678990	A	0.4979833960533142	So compartments that only communicate classically.
1680690	1702098	A	0.6269436478614807	The consequence of this theorem is that as soon as one has too many sensory and motor capabilities to run all at the same time, given your energy budget you end up being compartmentalized into compartments that only communicate classically.
1702194	1718250	A	0.5044227838516235	So you end up looking like this diagram where there are a bunch of components that do sensory motor, loops or memory, one or the other and they can only communicate classically.
1718670	1731280	A	0.8832901120185852	And they're controlled by some sort of attention system that selects which ones to activate depending on the amount of free energy that's available.
1732390	1738500	A	0.7857031226158142	And clearly, this clock function becomes part of this control system.
1739350	1765980	A	0.7988520264625549	So the physics alone of any system that's acting as that executes a fairly complicated interaction with its environment gives us this hierarchical compartmentalized structure without having to add any biological or cognitive science type assumptions at all.
1767710	1770300	A	0.8055601716041565	So we can go in three directions from this.
1771390	1775150	A	0.610863208770752	We can go deeper into the biology which we're going to do in October.
1775490	1787220	A	0.7686861157417297	We can go deeper into the physics which we're going to do in August and September and we can go deeper into this issue of alignment which is what we're going to do today.
1788630	1790430	A	0.8063023686408997	So there are four possibilities.
1790590	1800870	A	0.7695854902267456	If you think about two agents that have QRFs that are interacting across this boundary and the first one is trivial.
1801450	1814934	A	0.6177930235862732	If the B agent, the agent on the right side, doesn't actually employ any QRFs if it just interacts with the boundary thermally, then there is no alignment.
1814982	1820380	A	0.5447923541069031	You're in a trivial situation where A can measure something about B, but not in return.
1822370	1839860	A	0.6276453137397766	If the B agent deploys a QRF that's much broader in scope than the A agent what we show here in panel B, then the A agent can learn something about the B agent but misses most of what the B agent is doing.
1841750	1850962	A	0.7418570518493652	In panel C, we have agents with QRFs of the same size on the boundary, but they're not lined up correctly.
1851026	1854440	A	0.5612676739692688	So each one misses part of what the other is doing.
1855210	1863162	A	0.7703078389167786	And finally, indeed, we have the optimal situation where they have QRFs of the same size and they're actually lined up.
1863296	1868890	A	0.8680164217948914	So each sees what the other is doing, at least on this sector of the boundary.
1869230	1881370	A	0.5237460732460022	And since the agents have to allocate some of the boundary to free energy supply and can't look at that part, then they can't tell what's happening across their entire boundaries.
1881450	1887730	A	0.7703184485435486	They can only tell what's happening in this sector where they can actually deploy a QRF.
1888790	1899160	A	0.5557194948196411	But let's now look at this interesting situation, situation D, where the QRFs are allied between A and B.
1900890	1904600	A	0.49640169739723206	As I said, that's the optimal channel for A and B.
1905770	1935506	A	0.8372420072555542	And if we think about this, we can write the variational free energy or the uncertainty or the prediction error for A for the Qrfx as the action that it sees I E B's action, the difference between that and what it expects B to do.
1935688	1938930	A	0.8683324456214905	So what it can predict about B's action.
1939350	1971920	A	0.8411109447479248	And this is just the notion of free energy from the free energy principle, except translated into this situation where we have two QRFs and A can measure what B has done, but it can also use its QRF to predict, because it's predicting the very state that it's going to observe next of the same sector that B is using.
1973410	1991140	A	0.6544289588928223	Now, if we look at this diagram, we can see easily that the way to minimize the variational free energy and therefore maximize predictive capability is for these two QRFs to actually be the same.
1992150	2008700	A	0.8043307065963745	So if A is doing the same thing to the boundary that B is a can predict B's next action perfectly because B is going to do whatever A is doing.
2011310	2029070	A	0.8876248598098755	So what the free energy principle tells us in this case is that A and B, as they minimize their variational free energies, will approach having identical QRFs.
2030210	2040210	A	0.8242529630661011	Well, again, we have a theorem that tells us that if these QRFs are shared, a and B are not separable but entangled.
2041110	2047190	A	0.6985814571380615	And this is also fairly easy to see because it depends on this notion of non fungibility.
2048570	2055480	A	0.8674350380897522	If XA and XB both encode non fungible information, which is quantum systems, they do.
2056730	2066540	A	0.6275730133056641	Their states aren't clonable, so they can't be copies of each other because one can't clone an unknown system.
2067630	2072430	A	0.6977202296257019	So they can only be identical if they're actually identical systems.
2072930	2084850	A	0.8448333740234375	This is exactly the same point made earlier about Alice having to actually send her QRF to Bob if she wants Bob to use her QRF.
2086550	2094050	A	0.8243085145950317	So minimizing VFE for quantum systems is becoming entangled.
2095050	2103538	A	0.849666178226471	So the classical free energy principle, which tells us to minimize VFE actually drives quantum systems toward entanglement.
2103714	2115450	A	0.7619405388832092	And that's why it's a special case of the principle of unitarity which just says that any isolated joint system is going to asymptotically approach entanglement.
2117150	2127360	A	0.5526846051216125	So this raises an obvious question, which is why all of us aren't entangled with our environments all the time and entangled with each other?
2128530	2135170	A	0.7324516177177429	And the answer is that entanglement is really hard for complex systems.
2135990	2144500	A	0.8769134879112244	And this illustrates the sense in which the FEP is moving systems in two different directions at once.
2145370	2154790	A	0.8699047565460205	The FEP is driving systems to maintain their separability but it's also driving systems toward entanglement.
2155450	2163690	A	0.7391515970230103	And as the system becomes more and more complex the difference between those two outcomes becomes larger and larger.
2164350	2177390	A	0.8375011086463928	So recall from last time that the condition for separability is that the two systems have dimensions that are much larger than the dimension of their boundary.
2178370	2186770	A	0.7407763004302979	And this is the condition that allows them to have internal states, to have them have states that aren't located on their boundaries.
2187350	2193540	A	0.8317444920539856	And clearly, to formulate the free energy principle you have to have internal states.
2194810	2205510	A	0.8057429790496826	So if you do a complex QRF that's in a lot of computation then you need a lot of internal degrees of freedom to implement that computation.
2205850	2208362	A	0.7656424045562744	So you need a lot of internal state.
2208496	2211130	A	0.7905577421188354	So you have to have large dimensions.
2212030	2216090	A	0.7197233438491821	So complexity favors separability.
2216430	2221710	A	0.7822499871253967	As a system becomes more complex, it has to have more internal states.
2221860	2226720	A	0.8514049053192139	So it has to be, in a sense, more separable from whatever it's interacting with.
2227730	2230110	A	0.7940898537635803	Now, think about this classically.
2230850	2255350	A	0.4840551018714905	If you have a complex system that's doing a lot of computation then it requires a lot of free energy and it has to dissipate a lot of entropy in the form of heat, typically but something, some form of energy transfer that its environment is going to see as noise, as not informative.
2256650	2263340	A	0.6007077097892761	So a complex system is working very hard to predict its environment's next state.
2264110	2269286	A	0.627839982509613	But by working very hard it's dumping a lot of entropy into its environment.
2269478	2276730	A	0.7559884786605835	And putting in that extra entropy makes the environment's behavior even harder to predict.
2276890	2286690	A	0.5521209836006165	So the more you work at predicting what the environment is going to do the more you yourself make the environment's behavior less predictable.
2287110	2292670	A	0.6149174571037292	And this is the paradox of the FEP, which is not really a paradox.
2292750	2294980	A	0.7628417611122131	It's just what the physics does.
2296650	2325310	A	0.6252850890159607	So we can think of the FEP by driving systems to increase their distinctness from their environments or to self evidence, as Karl Friston calls it, as driving this increased complexity that both makes predictions better and makes predictions harder by transferring entropy into the environment.
2326050	2337086	A	0.6549774408340454	So what this tells us is that the FEP by itself will drive the development of systems with larger and larger complexity.
2337278	2345830	A	0.6163551807403564	And this clearly has enormous implications for evolutionary theory which we'll talk about in October.
2348170	2351554	A	0.8156009912490845	But I want to emphasize here that this is just the physics.
2351682	2357510	A	0.636023759841919	It's just what the FEP does when it's forced to maintain a boundary.
2360270	2371710	A	0.841958224773407	And before stopping here, I want to consider one aspect of this in particular, which is language.
2372210	2382800	A	0.8101629614830017	For example, human language, but any kind of language connecting any systems that are communicating with QRFs that are fairly close.
2383430	2389650	A	0.8427373170852661	And language is a complex QRF that we basically share.
2389800	2397670	A	0.5750129818916321	Otherwise, things like this interaction would be impossible, but we also remain distinct systems.
2398090	2401862	A	0.6240746378898621	So the question arises, how do we manage to do this?
2401996	2409530	A	0.8207220435142517	How do we manage to largely share a QRF while escaping, becoming entangled?
2410750	2424458	A	0.6349610090255737	And this is a question that's largely been ignored in physics because physicists have tended to ignore language and just assume that observers can communicate classically.
2424554	2440180	A	0.7330771088600159	So, for example, in talking about a Belly PR experiment, which is a canonical experiment for measuring entanglement, the observers have to be able to share their results, or they can't observe entanglement, right?
2441110	2454898	A	0.4855325520038605	The observed result is a bunch of observational statistics that violate Bell's inequality, and those statistics can only be computed given the results that both of the observers obtain.
2454994	2459290	A	0.845081627368927	So the observers have to share language to encode these results.
2460430	2464410	A	0.6509453654289246	So how come the observers aren't entangled?
2465310	2467850	A	0.5728902816772461	How come they are still separable?
2469310	2476026	A	0.8338128924369812	What we end up appealing to is some sort of common cause in the past to explain why they share a language.
2476218	2481760	A	0.7870490550994873	They both learned it from their culture, so their culture is some sort of common cause.
2482630	2486610	A	0.6911513805389404	But all such assumptions are fine tuning assumptions.
2487110	2504120	A	0.7683163285255432	So they all have basically the status of the value of something like the fine structure constant, without which we wouldn't have atoms and so we wouldn't have us.
2504970	2513210	A	0.8424476981163025	This value has to be within very small limits of the value we actually observe.
2513550	2517206	A	0.8042603731155396	And that's a case of fine tuning.
2517318	2521950	A	0.7818529605865479	The universe seems fine tuned in a way that allows us to exist.
2522450	2528560	A	0.5296432375907898	And if it wasn't fine tuned in that way, we wouldn't exist, and so we wouldn't observe anything.
2529170	2532218	A	0.7779293060302734	But fine tuning assumptions are a problem.
2532404	2535220	A	0.6797462105751038	They're a pointer to something we don't understand.
2536310	2546070	A	0.7154873609542847	And so I just want to leave you with the point that we have to be very careful when talking about interacting observers.
2546810	2569740	A	0.7411770820617676	So in talking about two components of some system that jointly interact with some environment but also communicate classically, and if you think back a few slides, that's exactly the structure that we've shown that the physics forces any complicated system to have.
2570610	2587970	A	0.8516961336135864	So next time, what we're going to focus on is this very question of how we describe observers that are both interacting with the quantum system and communicating classically in some language.
2588950	2591970	A	0.9097324013710022	So that session will be in August.
2592550	2604680	A	0.5722521543502808	At the end of this month, there's a discussion of this session with Aguirre, and I encourage you all to use the interactive Q and A to ask questions.
2605130	2610620	A	0.9359114766120911	You've been asking very good questions that I hope I've been managing to answer.
2611550	2613418	A	0.9706712365150452	So thank you very much.
2613504	2614422	A	0.7878167629241943	And Daniel.
2614486	2615500	A	0.6446645259857178	Over to you.
2617150	2617562	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
2617616	2617882	A	0.6177208423614502	Well.
2617936	2630720	B	0.8350643515586853	We have a few minutes for some questions maybe and or if you want to bring up any questions first, then go for it.
2633330	2642718	C	0.8971970677375793	I was curious if you could say any words on the slide where you had all the possible alignments of QRFs and what you meant more by interacting thermally.
2642814	2649350	C	0.7724593877792358	So when you have a trivial agent on one side, what exactly does it mean to say that you're interacting thermally?
2654080	2677830	A	0.7995685338973999	If you think about a system that is only interacting thermally with its environment, you end up thinking classically about, for example, an ideal gas that's in some sort of container and some of the molecules are very near the surface and their motions depend on the motions of all the other molecules that are inside.
2678600	2694040	A	0.8325013518333435	So there's a set of internal states that interact randomly with the external states that are near the boundary and so those external states interact randomly with the boundary.
2694700	2708750	A	0.7293306589126587	But notice in thinking in this way, you've imposed a spacetime embedding, so you've actually used space as a way of separating the internal states from the boundary states.
2710500	2729700	A	0.562323808670044	And a system that if you drop this assumption of a spatial boundary, then a system that's only interacting thermally with its environment is going to look like a system that doesn't have any real internal states.
2729850	2733030	A	0.777725338935852	It's going to look like a system that just has boundary states.
2733660	2738200	A	0.5943701267242432	And so a pure thermal interaction is going to start to look like entanglement.
2739180	2747384	A	0.6052520275115967	So we're actually only really interested in systems that aren't interacting only purely thermally with their environments.
2747512	2756860	A	0.5119993686676025	We're interested in systems that have enough internal structure that they're using that thermal energy to do something internally.
2757440	2777510	A	0.8604247570037842	So to give their internal dynamics some particular shape, so that their internal dynamics is actually circling around some well defined attractor that requires some energy to maintain itself.
2780200	2782244	C	0.7878034114837646	Yeah, I'm continuing with that question.
2782442	2799420	C	0.7842778563499451	I saw in the paper free energy principle for Quantum Systems that if you're in that situation when both keras are nontrivial, but perhaps B's is larger than a's ace perceives non local hidden variables.
2799760	2808220	C	0.8824267387390137	So I wonder if there is a way to relate those by taking a limit of making a small and recover the thermal interaction.
2808580	2815264	C	0.8571969270706177	Presumably if you let A become small, you should recover that thermal interaction, so to speak.
2815302	2815890	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
2816820	2819984	A	0.9507303833961487	Yeah, that's a very interesting comment actually.
2820102	2838016	A	0.6174694895744324	So if you're a system and all of your environments variables are effectively hidden to you, then you can't do any information processing because you don't have any access to any of your system, your environments variables.
2838208	2841172	A	0.6644033789634705	So yeah, your interaction can only be thermal.
2841236	2842490	A	0.5616849660873413	I think that's correct.
2844460	2845450	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
2852460	2857310	C	0.7154026031494141	Since we're in this, in this topic and we don't have to context switch in that way.
2857920	2860016	C	0.6754303574562073	On the other hand, you have noise, right?
2860118	2865250	C	0.6750866174697876	In one of those other situations, I can't recall which one.
2866340	2868448	C	0.8136849999427795	I guess in the reversed one, right.
2868614	2878880	C	0.8567332625389099	When a's QRF is larger than that of B, so it encompasses more of the boundary degrees of freedom, those that are not overlapping A perceives as noises.
2879040	2879604	C	0.5089255571365356	That's correct.
2879642	2880230	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
2881320	2881780	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2881850	2889412	A	0.9116597771644592	A will be looking at B's thermal sector, b's free energy sector.
2889556	2890200	A	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2890350	2903340	A	0.8620652556419373	So A may be interpreting, in a sense, what it's doing as informative, and A may even be seeing what B is doing as informative.
2906800	2923890	A	0.7927455306053162	So noise for B may be signal for A, depending on how a's QRF is structured, but A is seeing more information than B is trying to send it.
2925860	2930390	A	0.7847725749015808	So it's it's essentially the the reverse of the hidden variable case.
2931400	2942410	A	0.6161150932312012	There are variables in the other system that aren't telling you anything about what the other system is actually doing.
2946070	2955122	B	0.6355546116828918	That's very interesting in terms of reading too much or too little between the lines, connecting too many dots or connecting not enough dots.
2955266	2965098	B	0.6927427649497986	But these challenges where noise for one quantum cognitive agent might be signal for another and vice versa, those are the challenges that we want to address.
2965184	2977950	B	0.6132142543792725	Because to have a physics that doesn't recognize those situations is kind of taking the view from nowhere or not really addressing the complexity of a cognitive engagement.
2979890	2987330	A	0.6173834204673767	Yeah, it's describing interactions between, effectively, systems that don't share the same language.
2990390	2993300	B	0.7575778961181641	I have a question about the free energy principle here.
2994630	3002790	B	0.8111857175827026	Only in the last several years has the quantum free energy principle relationship come into light.
3002940	3011130	B	0.882235586643219	So maybe could you just share a little bit about what incremental or quantum advances enabled that to happen?
3011280	3030400	B	0.9009493589401245	Or what degrees of freedom were preexisting or added to enable work arising from perception and action in neural systems to also so naturally enter this context with the quantum information?
3032450	3047620	A	0.8517123460769653	Well, I think, at least from historical point of view, that connection was made based on the analogy between a Markov blanket and a Holographic screen.
3048570	3061420	A	0.7974063754081726	So these are structures developed in different parts of physics that essentially serve the same function of limiting the information that one system can have about another system.
3063230	3086930	A	0.5813806056976318	So it's that functional analogy between a Markov blanket defined classically and a Holographic screen defined in quantum theory that made it seem obvious that we could translate the free energy principle into a quantum theoretic principle.
3095350	3095954	B	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
3096072	3124650	B	0.8848400115966797	In live stream 40, we talked a lot about this, but I think that remains one of the most remarkable advances inside or outside the free energy principle literature based upon this functional acknowledgment of boundaries and the conditions that they entail, which, again, are the challenges that we want to address lest we ignore boundaries.
3124990	3125642	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3125776	3126774	A	0.6602189540863037	Yeah, precisely.
3126822	3131630	A	0.8368207216262817	I mean, the free energy principle is all about what happens when you have a boundary.
3137410	3139230	B	0.6894181966781616	The waste heat.
3141270	3148210	B	0.6907975077629089	Is this the actual thermal exhaust from our CPU?
3148710	3162338	B	0.7958301305770874	Or how can we think about the heat being released topologically rather than geometrically, like the location where it's released?
3162434	3171740	B	0.8559896945953369	What does it mean to consider physical processes topologically that we might otherwise just use a geometric way of thinking about?
3173870	3194530	A	0.7303721308708191	Well, you basically put your finger on it and that you're not worried about the spatial difference between the geometric spatial difference between where one kind of information flows through the boundary and where another kind of information flows through the boundary.
3195590	3199460	A	0.8560932874679565	And you can think about this in Markov blanket terms.
3201030	3203730	A	0.5987240672111511	And the Markov blanket is just a network.
3204650	3215830	A	0.524915874004364	And some of the causal arrows flowing through that blanket network are effectively transmitting noise.
3219290	3228374	A	0.8642609715461731	And you can think in the same way with respect to a holographic screen if you're doing a certain amount of information processing.
3228422	3240522	A	0.491168737411499	And this this brings up the whole issue of how how efficient is a system in its information processing?
3240586	3243630	A	0.9015746712684631	How close is it to the land hour limit?
3243710	3244340	A	0.6114954352378845	Basically?
3247350	3262950	A	0.8833060264587402	Can it extract more energy from some bits than it has to use to modify the states of other bits?
3264090	3270060	A	0.7747505307197571	That's what this, if you will, metabolic question is all about.
3272190	3287150	A	0.8215509653091431	In the case of an organism, is it can I get more energy from some of the chemistry that I have access to than I need to use to modify the chemistry that I need to modify?
3288290	3291622	A	0.8032427430152893	And if not, then life stops.
3291786	3293650	A	0.8211046457290649	Everything grinds to a halt.
3300810	3310066	B	0.8222252726554871	Now, can the heat exhaust informationally be useful for another agent somehow?
3310178	3316234	B	0.6920948624610901	I mean, can't we recover heat in a steam engine and use it to do useful work?
3316432	3321334	B	0.6372556686401367	Not to the point of a perpetual motion machine, but how can we recover exhaust?
3321462	3324640	B	0.8145368695259094	And then what does the perpetual motion machine look like?
3327010	3340420	A	0.5417102575302124	Well, the environment is the system sitting over on the other side of the boundary that is absorbing whatever waste heat is generated by the system.
3341910	3345620	A	0.668395459651947	Let's call it Alice that we're interested in.
3346310	3366780	A	0.6020480990409851	So that environment may be alice can't tell this, but it may be divided up into lots of different compartments, some of which are basically sucking in Alice's waste heat and doing something with it.
3368190	3386162	A	0.8314578533172607	So this is really a question about how is the environment structured and what operations does the environment execute with the input that it gets?
3386216	3388450	A	0.8412604331970215	How does it interpret that input?
3392200	3393430	B	0.7176825404167175	And what would.
3395800	3413150	A	0.6493222713470459	This gets back to this question about how do we talk about multiple agents that are communicating with each other instead of talking about an environment that we don't characterize at all?
3415200	3427730	A	0.8888894319534302	How do we talk about an environment that includes some specified or preferred systems that are treated as or known to be other agents?
3430900	3434800	A	0.8728428483009338	Let me get back to your question about perpetual motion machine.
3435460	3448580	A	0.7762317657470703	Notice that in classical thermodynamics there's always the assumption that there's a big environment out there the rest of the universe or whatever, the whole environment that's not on Earth.
3449820	3463790	A	0.6214025020599365	That is an arbitrarily large source of or it's not an arbitrarily large source of free energy, but it's a large source of free energy.
3464400	3470216	A	0.5387886166572571	And it's a large sink for entropy, a kind of arbitrarily large sink for entropy.
3470408	3489028	A	0.64934903383255	So the second law of thermodynamics says the entropy of this entire system counting the whole surrounding environment doesn't decrease, so it can increase and still satisfy the second law.
3489114	3495750	A	0.7063183188438416	So this gives you the classical 19th century heat death of the Universe idea.
3497000	3517820	A	0.6439707279205322	And so your proposed machine is sitting somewhere embedded in this gigantic environment that can provide some finite amount of free energy but can exhaust effectively an arbitrary amount of entropy.
3519520	3535116	A	0.6864712238311768	So any machine has to dissipate entropy as it runs to fill up this kind of arbitrary sink of entropy that's the classical rest of the Universe.
3535228	3538180	A	0.8451162576675415	Now, compare that to the picture in Quantum theory.
3538680	3543670	A	0.817930281162262	The picture in Quantum theory is the Universe, by definition, is an isolated system.
3544600	3551480	A	0.739388644695282	So its total information content doesn't change, right?
3551550	3552564	A	0.6833165287971497	It's evolving.
3552612	3560170	A	0.8288732171058655	unitarily unitary operations preserve information, so they're just moving information around.
3562800	3578800	A	0.6996808648109436	So from the point of view of any local system, the local system is getting information from its environment, so it sees its environment losing information, so gaining entropy.
3580900	3592400	A	0.6004465818405151	What this tells us is that entropy is, in fact, not a globally definable quantity.
3592480	3598260	A	0.7355625033378601	Entropy is always defined relative to some observer, some division, some boundary.
3600140	3611850	A	0.7420520782470703	And this is another kind of big change in the last few decades and has led to, for example, entropic definitions of time.
3612400	3622590	A	0.8269075155258179	My local external time arrow is whatever direction I see entropy increasing the most.
3629210	3637110	A	0.8562783598899841	So, again, I would refer to people like Rovelli and Max Taymar, who developed many of these ideas.
3640350	3641100	B	0.918424665927887	Awesome.
3642430	3658222	B	0.9402954578399658	All right, thank you, Chris, and Aguirre looking forward to seeing everyone's questions submitted and their preparation and participation and measurement in the discussion section.
3658366	3660162	B	0.9191112518310547	So thank you.
3660296	3661026	B	0.6996943354606628	Till next time.
3661048	3661634	A	0.4896697998046875	All right.
3661752	3663102	A	0.8654495477676392	Thanks again, Daniel.
3663246	3663714	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3663752	3665938	A	0.7780313491821289	Aguirre we'll see you later.
3666104	3666930	B	0.5137446522712708	Bye.
