6930	8462	2	B	0.99	Hello and welcome everyone.
8596	11230	3	B	0.92914	It's July 13, 2023.
11380	17818	4	B	0.69305	We're here in physics as information processing with the third lecture by Chris Fields.
17914	31474	5	B	0.99935	So please check out the course website, Coda Document, where you can submit questions, check out the recordings and descriptions of all sessions, and register if you want to participate in one of the discussion sections.
31602	34600	6	B	0.99958	So thank you again, Chris, to you.
36410	44330	7	A	0.52837	Thank you and welcome to Physics as Information Processing, session Three, which is about quantum reference frames.
45470	67490	8	A	0.9988	So in this course, we've talked about quantum information theory, which we characterized as a general theory that describes the exchange of information, exchange of finite information between two finite agents that are separated by some boundary.
67830	77330	9	A	0.94	And we emphasize that this is a topological theory, not a geometric theory, so it makes no assumptions about an embedding spacetime.
79050	110830	10	A	0.87	And last time we showed how to characterize this boundary of script B as an array of N, some finite N quantum bits or qubits, and how to characterize the interaction of the agents A and B with the boundary as an alternating cycle of preparing and measuring the qubits in this array.
111410	120130	11	A	0.55	And we showed that their interaction could be represented as a sum of operators, each of which act on just one of the qubits.
121350	136038	12	A	0.69	And we also talked about the need for each of the agents A and B to choose a reference frame for their interaction with the qubits that defined which way was up.
136204	162590	13	A	0.99938	So what the orientations of the qubits meant and emphasized that the two observers A and B could choose different reference frames, so different ways of measuring and preparing their qubits that use different meanings for the idea of up for each qubit.
163570	179490	14	A	1	And we ended the last session with a pointer forward toward the quantum formulation of the free energy principle, which can be stated as the claim that interacting systems behave in a way that aligns their reference frames.
180490	199014	15	A	0.8	And pointed out at that time that what this means is that the two agents A and B approach entanglement asymptotically, and that therefore the FEP is a classical limit of the principle of unitarity, which is the core principle of quantum theory.
199062	202540	16	A	0.76284	So we'll see in this session why this is true.
204130	221330	17	A	0.99855	So what we'll talk about today is what reference frames are in general, how they make observations and actions meaningful, so how they give physics a semantics, and then we'll talk about the free energy principle.
223510	225650	18	A	0.97724	So what is a reference frame?
226550	241160	19	A	1	The idea that physics involves reference frames goes back at least to Galileo, but was probably familiar well before that, just not formalized in the way that Galileo formalized it.
242270	247050	20	A	0.88241	So the key idea can be thought of in terms of motion.
247550	259738	21	A	0.93	And you're all familiar, for example, with riding a bicycle or driving a car and seeing the world as if it's passing by you at some velocity, with some velocity.
259914	264830	22	A	1	And of course, with respect to the world you're passing by it with some velocity.
265810	280802	23	A	0.88	And this idea that velocity is not absolute but that's relative to some observer who measures it in some reference frame is the foundation for theories of relativity.
280866	298410	24	A	0.95213	So Galileo developed his theory of relativity which basically was just a way of converting from classical velocities measured by one observer to classical velocities measured by another observer that was moving with respect to the first one.
298560	317490	25	A	0.85	And this provided the foundation for Einstein's theories of relativity which modified Galileo's by adding the concept that the observers have to change exchange information and can only exchange it at the speed of light which is finite.
319990	324660	26	A	0.99756	So this idea in physics has a long history.
325110	332040	27	A	0.89	Of course, the core idea is that measurements are always with respect to something or other.
332490	338870	28	A	1	And the something or other is a reference frame and different agents can choose different reference frames.
339290	341494	29	A	0.79	And this idea is very old.
341612	350170	30	A	0.99996	Here we have a picture of anubis choosing a feather as the reference frame with which to measure the heart of the pharaoh.
350590	354906	31	A	0.87892	So this goes back to well before the common era.
354938	357950	32	A	0.99194	This is about 2000 BCE.
358370	387750	33	A	0.71359	So this is a very old idea that's been elaborated over the centuries as science has developed and in the fairly big change in how this idea was thought about occurred in classical physics reference frames were always thought of as mathematical abstractions and an observer and a reference frame were more or less identified by Galileo.
388250	403210	34	A	1	And that identification is carried forward into Einstein who thinks about observers, for example, sitting on photons and observers in spaceships and observers riding on railroad trains and this sort of thing.
403280	408720	35	A	0.96	And always that just means think of a reference frame that's doing something or other.
409570	433350	36	A	0.84431	So a reference frame in classical physics is essentially just a coordinate system and these abstract coordinate systems can be employed in thought experiments and so they are a way to illustrate classical intuitions about motion.
434490	447002	37	A	0.96	And in the 90s, as quantum information theory developed it was realized that a reference frame actually consists of a physical object.
447136	454250	38	A	0.65	I mean, even in the picture from the Egyptian tomb the reference frame is a physical feather.
455490	462554	39	A	1	And that means that the reference frame itself is described by quantum theory.
462602	464560	40	A	0.98319	It's some quantum system.
465810	486950	41	A	1	And if you think about reference frames that are familiar for example, meter sticks for measuring distance or clocks for measuring time or gyroscopes or batteries or even the Earth's gravitational fields which typically defines up for us those are all physical objects that can be described by quantum theory.
487770	500490	42	A	0.99927	Well, this was an important insight because it led to the realization that reference frames as quantum systems are unique.
501550	505200	43	A	1	And uniqueness in quantum theory is very strong.
506610	514080	44	A	0.98975	There's the no Cloning theorem which states that you can't reproduce exactly reproduce any unknown quantum state.
515730	523074	45	A	1	And that applies to reference frames because they encode what Bartlett et al.
523112	533270	46	A	0.99851	In that paper called non fungible information which just means information that can't be completely represented in any finite bit string.
534010	538520	47	A	0.68266	So unless you know the state of a reference frame, you can't clone it.
539290	555946	48	A	0.98986	Since these reference frames encode more than any bit string's worth of information in their quantum phases, they're unique and their states are unknown.
556138	567726	49	A	1	And the consequence of this is that if Alice wants Bob to use her reference frame to make a measurement, she can't just send him a description.
567918	571410	50	A	0.99927	She has to actually send the reference frame.
572390	591350	51	A	0.54	And this has an important consequence for physics because it makes all replicate measurements approximate because observers obviously aren't using exactly the same physical objects as their reference frames.
591790	605630	52	A	0.99954	But there's a deeper implication of this, which is that Alice's ultimate rock bottom reference frame is actually implemented by her body, by her brain.
606690	618426	53	A	0.56	And using any external reference frame requires having this internal reference frame that makes the external reference frame meaningful and usable.
618538	623902	54	A	0.99995	So, for example, this thing is a piece of a meter stick, a third of a meter stick.
624046	630790	55	A	0.99966	But for me to use it to make measurements, I have to actually have some concept of distance.
631130	635400	56	A	1	And that concept of distance is implemented by my nervous system.
636170	641990	57	A	1	And that implementation is my reference frame for length.
642830	648598	58	A	1	And it's what gives meaning to any external measurement of length.
648774	659600	59	A	0.99941	It's what makes my measurements of length actionable by me using my effectors or action capabilities, whatever they are.
660210	667730	60	A	0.9999	So my internal reference frames are what make information I get from the world actionable.
668230	675694	61	A	0.82	And in Bates and sense of differences that make a difference, actionability is the core of semantics.
675822	679720	62	A	0.99999	Something is meaningful if I can do something about it.
680090	693990	63	A	0.9999	So this idea that we all contain embodied reference frames gives physics a semantics by giving observers a semantics.
694150	695580	64	A	1	And this is new.
696590	706030	65	A	0.99965	This is an idea that never really appeared in physics before that measurements automatically had to have some kind of semantics.
706610	711550	66	A	0.58195	But reference frames give semantics to measurements.
713730	717410	67	A	0.63577	So here's an example of an embodied reference frame.
717990	723266	68	A	0.99993	This is the reference frame that bacteria use for chemotaxis I.
723288	723522	69	A	0.71	E.
723576	733830	70	A	1	To move toward molecules in the environment that they like, like sugars and to move away from molecules that they don't like, like acids.
734250	739142	71	A	1	And it's been worked out in great detail over decades of experimental work.
739196	741190	72	A	1	And this is a rough schematic.
742350	745130	73	A	1	The reference frame has three parts.
746590	753530	74	A	0.78369	There's the measurement part, which is conveniently located in the front of the bacterium.
754050	757950	75	A	0.99	And it consists of a bunch of receptors that probe the environment.
758450	764346	76	A	1	And they can bind molecules, which are called ligands, out in the environment.
764538	770250	77	A	0.52	And when they bind them, they send a signal into the back of the bacterium.
770330	783830	78	A	0.95	And it turns out that there's a little miniature reference frame attached directly to these ligands which is this r and B system which control the ligands, not the ligands, the receptor sensitivity.
784890	800170	79	A	0.9982	Then the back of the reference frame is the action component and it consists of a set of molecules that control a motor, a molecular motor, that drives the flagella on the bacteria.
800830	807390	80	A	0.89	And the flagellum allows it to swim forwards or turn in some other direction.
808050	816640	81	A	0.7	And depending on how it spins, the creature either goes in the direction of something it likes or it stops and turns around.
817430	832760	82	A	1	And the stuff in the middle is a little molecular feedback loop that represents the amount of ligand in the environment that the bacterium expects to see.
833130	842410	83	A	0.99992	So this is the middle of the reference frame and it defines the default value for what the bacterium is observing in its environment.
843150	859760	84	A	1	And if you're thinking in terms of the free energy principle or Bayesian inference, then you'll immediately see the concentration of this molecule is encoding a prior probability, the bacterium's prior probability for what its environment is like.
860450	871300	85	A	1	And the zero point, the default value of that encoding, is the ligand concentration in which the bacterium does nothing.
872310	890710	86	A	0.99926	So a QRF in general can be characterized as an expected value, which is here the concentration of this molecule p y phosphorylated plus a bunch of computation, which is all the rest of the things in this diagram.
891950	897130	87	A	0.99998	So this is a very simple QRF that's embodied by a bacteria.
897470	908670	88	A	0.56691	Here's a more complicated QRF that's embodied by eukaryotic cells, or more complicated cells like our cells.
909170	917070	89	A	1	And this is the reference frame that makes decisions about whether cells are going to divide.
918150	932790	90	A	0.99796	So on the top you see the cell's membrane, and there are all sorts of receptors sticking out of it that detect hormones and neurotransmitters and growth factors and this, that, and the other thing, many of which are produced by other cells.
933610	955710	91	A	1	And those receptors communicate via a lot of chemistry with the nucleus, which is contained in another membrane and so serves as, in a sense, the outside upon which the reference frame is acting.
956130	963770	92	A	1	And what this reference frame does is control the transcription of large numbers of molecules from DNA.
963850	967586	93	A	1	So it basically controls what proteins the cell is making.
967768	974530	94	A	1	And those proteins end up doing something like restructuring the cytoplasm and actually driving cell division.
975190	987030	95	A	1	And the stuff in the middle of this reference frame, which I've labeled the integrative center, are three molecules called RAF, mech and ERC.
987450	993450	96	A	1	And they're connected by positive by bi directional feedback loops.
993950	1004300	97	A	1	And they basically negotiate the default value of the environment at which the cell does nothing.
1005330	1014970	98	A	0.99967	So they're the middle of the reference frame that represents the cell's expectation values about what's going on in its environment.
1015130	1020754	99	A	0.82821	So you can imagine now what reference frames encoded by our nervous system look like.
1020792	1035350	100	A	0.51652	They're extremely complicated and exist at multiple scales, from the scale of molecules in cells to the scale of large scale connections between parts of our brains.
1037370	1039960	101	A	0.99984	So how do we represent all this stuff?
1041050	1047020	102	A	0.99491	There are many ways to do this, but this is a particularly simple way.
1048350	1068370	103	A	0.99999	It assumes that whatever's in the middle, which is here called C prime is the most general thing that the inputs can give information to and the most general thing that can give information to the outputs.
1069030	1086070	104	A	1	And most general here has a category theoretic definition so it can be stated in a way that's equivalent across many different specific mathematical forms.
1086570	1095158	105	A	0.99995	But if you're familiar with neural networks, this will look to you a lot like the skeleton of a variational auto encoder.
1095334	1097660	106	A	0.89	And that's basically what it is.
1098910	1121620	107	A	0.84	And I don't want to deal with this formalism except to say that it exists and is very convenient, except to say that we can attach this kind of formal diagram as a representation of a QRF to our representation of the boundary between two interacting agents.
1122550	1134070	108	A	0.78	And we can use these formal structures to drive the measurement operators that actually implement physical changes on this boundary.
1135530	1146646	109	A	0.82	And I'll represent this whole business with just a triangle labeled Q for some QRF that's attached to the boundary.
1146838	1160830	110	A	1	And we can use this simple notation then to investigate what sorts of structures one gets when one starts to think about systems as implementing specific QRFs.
1162290	1169970	111	A	0.54	And here's the structure of the minimal system that we can really think of as an interesting observer.
1170870	1201078	112	A	1	And this is a system that has some QRF that I've called E that looks at its environment, the part of its environment that it can actually observe and act on, and it defines a sector of the boundary which mathematically is just the image of this Qrfe that the system can manipulate.
1201174	1208560	113	A	0.99999	So this is the part of the environment or the part of the boundary that the system actually sees and can do something about.
1209890	1227380	114	A	1	And for this observer to be interesting, it needs to be able to detect the difference between what it sees now and what it saw just then so that it can decide whether to take some action or other.
1227750	1236802	115	A	0.99999	So it needs a memory and that requires another QRF that has some allocated piece of the boundary recall.
1236866	1244570	116	A	1	The boundary is where classical information gets written in this purely quantum theoretic formalism.
1245870	1250620	117	A	0.99972	So it needs a memory sector that that QRF can act on.
1251470	1266000	118	A	0.73	And then in order to do this computation and specifically in order to write information to the boundary, in order to actually flip bits on the boundary, it needs free energy.
1266630	1279890	119	A	0.99981	So the rest of its boundary gets devoted to extracting free energy from the environment and exhausting free energy, waste heat, in other words, into the environment.
1280050	1284600	120	A	1	And so it has this nice little thermodynamic cycle that drives everything else.
1285770	1304800	121	A	1	And finally, in order to tell now from just a second ago the information in memory, it needs a clock that marks the information in memory as not current, so as past information.
1305730	1318900	122	A	0.99	And if it can store multiple memory records, it needs to be able to count and say this piece of remembered information is actually more recent than that piece over there.
1319510	1327490	123	A	0.99994	So it has to implement a little internal clock, and that clock is its internal time QRF.
1327830	1331058	124	A	0.98	And we've seen that QRFs act on boundaries.
1331154	1335320	125	A	0.99995	This clock acts on a boundary, but it doesn't act on B.
1335690	1353050	126	A	0.9996	It acts on an internal boundary that's essentially the boundary between it the clock and the points at the ends of these QRFs that actually encode information that's either read from the environment or written to the environment.
1354050	1372130	127	A	0.99522	So already this minimal observer has a little bit of hierarchical structure, which is that its clock has to, in some sense, be higher up in the hierarchy than the parts, the QRFs that interact directly with the environment.
1373590	1384950	128	A	0.99978	So if you have a structure like this, you face a metabolic trade off for a fixed amount of energy that you can extract from the environment.
1385290	1393740	129	A	0.99998	You can allocate it either into learning more about the environment or remembering more about what you learned before.
1396510	1402170	130	A	0.43935	So any system has to make this decision about how they're going to use energy.
1402240	1405758	131	A	0.92647	Are they going to devote it to learning more or remembering more.
1405924	1409050	132	A	1	And your laptop makes that decision.
1409210	1411390	133	A	0.99989	Memory is cheap for your laptop.
1412050	1413770	134	A	0.99999	Your brain makes that decision.
1413850	1416390	135	A	0.85891	Memory is much more expensive for your brain.
1416570	1419102	136	A	0.98	And all cells have to make that decision.
1419246	1426142	137	A	1	And the universal solution to this trade off is course grading memory.
1426286	1426882	138	A	0.67	I e.
1426936	1430878	139	A	0.99958	Remembering things in less detail than you saw them in the beginning.
1431054	1432710	140	A	0.53289	Ander, you have a comment?
1433530	1434278	141	C	0.66198	Yes.
1434444	1437074	142	C	0.59	I wanted to ask a question now before it gets too late.
1437122	1452630	143	C	0.99568	So two or three slides ago, when we were looking at the diagram of the coconut diagrams, I was wondering if the classifiers identified with measurement and preparation.
1452710	1466602	144	C	0.53757	Those correspond to sensory and action degrees of freedom in the earlier picture with the bacteria and the classifier in the middle in that picture, would it correspond to the default chemical concentration?
1466746	1468480	145	A	0.57115	That yes, exactly.
1469010	1470586	146	C	0.9889	Okay, perfect.
1470708	1471380	147	A	0.97941	Yeah.
1474150	1478770	148	A	0.99977	That crossing point in the middle is specifically where the default is encoded.
1479930	1482360	149	A	0.99915	Thank you for pointing that out.
1485230	1491020	150	A	0.98499	Okay, so let's follow the consequences of this metabolic issue.
1493150	1508586	151	A	0.99998	If you have a system that's a little bit smarter than our minimal system that can actually detect and measure the states of objects, it has to do even more work because it has to encode even more QRFs.
1508778	1514686	152	A	0.64766	So think of measuring the state of some object like a volt meter in a laboratory.
1514878	1522710	153	A	0.99118	If I tell you to go into the lab and tell me what the voltmeter is reading, then the first thing you have to do is find the voltmeter.
1523050	1532170	154	A	1	And your process of finding the voltmeter is independent of your process of reading what it's actually saying on its dial.
1533150	1545840	155	A	0.9998	So in order to measure the state of an object, you have to have two QRFs one that lets you find the object, and then the other that lets you measure the state of interest of the object.
1546370	1562820	156	A	1	And we call these the R sector for reference that lets you find the object and the P sector for pointer because old instruments used to have pointers on dials that read analog numbers.
1566830	1596898	157	A	0.99998	But what thinking about object identification tells you is that every object that you can identify leads to having to sector both the informative part of your boundary and the memory part of your boundary into two new sectors one to store information about object identification and one to store information about the states of those objects.
1597074	1600310	158	A	0.99709	So this requires much more metabolism.
1601210	1605234	159	A	1	And again, the solution is coarse grain.
1605362	1610970	160	A	0.96072	Typically, what we coarse grain is our memory of the object that we've identified.
1612750	1616250	161	A	0.90803	So what does this do to systems?
1619070	1628240	162	A	0.99996	Because making measurements costs energy and recording memories costs energy.
1629330	1635586	163	A	0.99999	We have to make decisions about what QRS to use at what time.
1635688	1645250	164	A	0.99983	Given our finite energy budgets, we can't look at the world with all of our measurement capabilities at the same time because it's too expensive.
1646410	1675546	165	A	1	And now we see the effect of a theorem in quantum information theory which is that if two QRFs can't be deployed simultaneously for whatever reason that corresponds to them not commuting as operators and if they don't commute as operators, they have to be implemented by compartments that are separable.
1675658	1678990	166	A	0.99997	So compartments that only communicate classically.
1680690	1702098	167	A	0.79	The consequence of this theorem is that as soon as one has too many sensory and motor capabilities to run all at the same time, given your energy budget you end up being compartmentalized into compartments that only communicate classically.
1702194	1718250	168	A	0.77675	So you end up looking like this diagram where there are a bunch of components that do sensory motor, loops or memory, one or the other and they can only communicate classically.
1718670	1731280	169	A	1	And they're controlled by some sort of attention system that selects which ones to activate depending on the amount of free energy that's available.
1732390	1738500	170	A	0.97	And clearly, this clock function becomes part of this control system.
1739350	1765980	171	A	0.99996	So the physics alone of any system that's acting as that executes a fairly complicated interaction with its environment gives us this hierarchical compartmentalized structure without having to add any biological or cognitive science type assumptions at all.
1767710	1770300	172	A	0.74207	So we can go in three directions from this.
1771390	1775150	173	A	0.95613	We can go deeper into the biology which we're going to do in October.
1775490	1787220	174	A	0.99933	We can go deeper into the physics which we're going to do in August and September and we can go deeper into this issue of alignment which is what we're going to do today.
1788630	1790430	175	A	0.99996	So there are four possibilities.
1790590	1800870	176	A	0.99999	If you think about two agents that have QRFs that are interacting across this boundary and the first one is trivial.
1801450	1814934	177	A	0.99998	If the B agent, the agent on the right side, doesn't actually employ any QRFs if it just interacts with the boundary thermally, then there is no alignment.
1814982	1820380	178	A	0.99107	You're in a trivial situation where A can measure something about B, but not in return.
1822370	1839860	179	A	1	If the B agent deploys a QRF that's much broader in scope than the A agent what we show here in panel B, then the A agent can learn something about the B agent but misses most of what the B agent is doing.
1841750	1850962	180	A	0.9999	In panel C, we have agents with QRFs of the same size on the boundary, but they're not lined up correctly.
1851026	1854440	181	A	1	So each one misses part of what the other is doing.
1855210	1863162	182	A	1	And finally, indeed, we have the optimal situation where they have QRFs of the same size and they're actually lined up.
1863296	1868890	183	A	0.99999	So each sees what the other is doing, at least on this sector of the boundary.
1869230	1881370	184	A	0.64	And since the agents have to allocate some of the boundary to free energy supply and can't look at that part, then they can't tell what's happening across their entire boundaries.
1881450	1887730	185	A	1	They can only tell what's happening in this sector where they can actually deploy a QRF.
1888790	1899160	186	A	0.62655	But let's now look at this interesting situation, situation D, where the QRFs are allied between A and B.
1900890	1904600	187	A	1	As I said, that's the optimal channel for A and B.
1905770	1935506	188	A	0.89	And if we think about this, we can write the variational free energy or the uncertainty or the prediction error for A for the Qrfx as the action that it sees I E B's action, the difference between that and what it expects B to do.
1935688	1938930	189	A	0.99958	So what it can predict about B's action.
1939350	1971920	190	A	1	And this is just the notion of free energy from the free energy principle, except translated into this situation where we have two QRFs and A can measure what B has done, but it can also use its QRF to predict, because it's predicting the very state that it's going to observe next of the same sector that B is using.
1973410	1991140	191	A	1	Now, if we look at this diagram, we can see easily that the way to minimize the variational free energy and therefore maximize predictive capability is for these two QRFs to actually be the same.
1992150	2008700	192	A	0.99221	So if A is doing the same thing to the boundary that B is a can predict B's next action perfectly because B is going to do whatever A is doing.
2011310	2029070	193	A	0.99726	So what the free energy principle tells us in this case is that A and B, as they minimize their variational free energies, will approach having identical QRFs.
2030210	2040210	194	A	0.99989	Well, again, we have a theorem that tells us that if these QRFs are shared, a and B are not separable but entangled.
2041110	2047190	195	A	1	And this is also fairly easy to see because it depends on this notion of non fungibility.
2048570	2055480	196	A	0.58515	If XA and XB both encode non fungible information, which is quantum systems, they do.
2056730	2066540	197	A	0.99985	Their states aren't clonable, so they can't be copies of each other because one can't clone an unknown system.
2067630	2072430	198	A	0.60638	So they can only be identical if they're actually identical systems.
2072930	2084850	199	A	0.99999	This is exactly the same point made earlier about Alice having to actually send her QRF to Bob if she wants Bob to use her QRF.
2086550	2094050	200	A	0.99959	So minimizing VFE for quantum systems is becoming entangled.
2095050	2103538	201	A	0.99929	So the classical free energy principle, which tells us to minimize VFE actually drives quantum systems toward entanglement.
2103714	2115450	202	A	1	And that's why it's a special case of the principle of unitarity which just says that any isolated joint system is going to asymptotically approach entanglement.
2117150	2127360	203	A	0.99985	So this raises an obvious question, which is why all of us aren't entangled with our environments all the time and entangled with each other?
2128530	2135170	204	A	0.79	And the answer is that entanglement is really hard for complex systems.
2135990	2144500	205	A	1	And this illustrates the sense in which the FEP is moving systems in two different directions at once.
2145370	2154790	206	A	1	The FEP is driving systems to maintain their separability but it's also driving systems toward entanglement.
2155450	2163690	207	A	1	And as the system becomes more and more complex the difference between those two outcomes becomes larger and larger.
2164350	2177390	208	A	0.99991	So recall from last time that the condition for separability is that the two systems have dimensions that are much larger than the dimension of their boundary.
2178370	2186770	209	A	1	And this is the condition that allows them to have internal states, to have them have states that aren't located on their boundaries.
2187350	2193540	210	A	1	And clearly, to formulate the free energy principle you have to have internal states.
2194810	2205510	211	A	0.66943	So if you do a complex QRF that's in a lot of computation then you need a lot of internal degrees of freedom to implement that computation.
2205850	2208362	212	A	0.99983	So you need a lot of internal state.
2208496	2211130	213	A	0.99987	So you have to have large dimensions.
2212030	2216090	214	A	0.99923	So complexity favors separability.
2216430	2221710	215	A	0.8865	As a system becomes more complex, it has to have more internal states.
2221860	2226720	216	A	0.99999	So it has to be, in a sense, more separable from whatever it's interacting with.
2227730	2230110	217	A	0.99	Now, think about this classically.
2230850	2255350	218	A	1	If you have a complex system that's doing a lot of computation then it requires a lot of free energy and it has to dissipate a lot of entropy in the form of heat, typically but something, some form of energy transfer that its environment is going to see as noise, as not informative.
2256650	2263340	219	A	0.99994	So a complex system is working very hard to predict its environment's next state.
2264110	2269286	220	A	0.9782	But by working very hard it's dumping a lot of entropy into its environment.
2269478	2276730	221	A	0.54	And putting in that extra entropy makes the environment's behavior even harder to predict.
2276890	2286690	222	A	0.99994	So the more you work at predicting what the environment is going to do the more you yourself make the environment's behavior less predictable.
2287110	2292670	223	A	0.99	And this is the paradox of the FEP, which is not really a paradox.
2292750	2294980	224	A	0.99855	It's just what the physics does.
2296650	2325310	225	A	0.99989	So we can think of the FEP by driving systems to increase their distinctness from their environments or to self evidence, as Karl Friston calls it, as driving this increased complexity that both makes predictions better and makes predictions harder by transferring entropy into the environment.
2326050	2337086	226	A	0.99976	So what this tells us is that the FEP by itself will drive the development of systems with larger and larger complexity.
2337278	2345830	227	A	1	And this clearly has enormous implications for evolutionary theory which we'll talk about in October.
2348170	2351554	228	A	0.99974	But I want to emphasize here that this is just the physics.
2351682	2357510	229	A	0.41511	It's just what the FEP does when it's forced to maintain a boundary.
2360270	2371710	230	A	0.79	And before stopping here, I want to consider one aspect of this in particular, which is language.
2372210	2382800	231	A	1	For example, human language, but any kind of language connecting any systems that are communicating with QRFs that are fairly close.
2383430	2389650	232	A	0.61	And language is a complex QRF that we basically share.
2389800	2397670	233	A	0.80868	Otherwise, things like this interaction would be impossible, but we also remain distinct systems.
2398090	2401862	234	A	0.99995	So the question arises, how do we manage to do this?
2401996	2409530	235	A	1	How do we manage to largely share a QRF while escaping, becoming entangled?
2410750	2424458	236	A	1	And this is a question that's largely been ignored in physics because physicists have tended to ignore language and just assume that observers can communicate classically.
2424554	2440180	237	A	0.99994	So, for example, in talking about a Belly PR experiment, which is a canonical experiment for measuring entanglement, the observers have to be able to share their results, or they can't observe entanglement, right?
2441110	2454898	238	A	0.88	The observed result is a bunch of observational statistics that violate Bell's inequality, and those statistics can only be computed given the results that both of the observers obtain.
2454994	2459290	239	A	0.99998	So the observers have to share language to encode these results.
2460430	2464410	240	A	0.59398	So how come the observers aren't entangled?
2465310	2467850	241	A	0.99999	How come they are still separable?
2469310	2476026	242	A	0.99999	What we end up appealing to is some sort of common cause in the past to explain why they share a language.
2476218	2481760	243	A	0.99999	They both learned it from their culture, so their culture is some sort of common cause.
2482630	2486610	244	A	0.99796	But all such assumptions are fine tuning assumptions.
2487110	2504120	245	A	0.72177	So they all have basically the status of the value of something like the fine structure constant, without which we wouldn't have atoms and so we wouldn't have us.
2504970	2513210	246	A	0.99985	This value has to be within very small limits of the value we actually observe.
2513550	2517206	247	A	1	And that's a case of fine tuning.
2517318	2521950	248	A	1	The universe seems fine tuned in a way that allows us to exist.
2522450	2528560	249	A	0.59	And if it wasn't fine tuned in that way, we wouldn't exist, and so we wouldn't observe anything.
2529170	2532218	250	A	0.59779	But fine tuning assumptions are a problem.
2532404	2535220	251	A	0.54697	They're a pointer to something we don't understand.
2536310	2546070	252	A	0.55	And so I just want to leave you with the point that we have to be very careful when talking about interacting observers.
2546810	2569740	253	A	0.99977	So in talking about two components of some system that jointly interact with some environment but also communicate classically, and if you think back a few slides, that's exactly the structure that we've shown that the physics forces any complicated system to have.
2570610	2587970	254	A	0.76414	So next time, what we're going to focus on is this very question of how we describe observers that are both interacting with the quantum system and communicating classically in some language.
2588950	2591970	255	A	0.99948	So that session will be in August.
2592550	2604680	256	A	0.53	At the end of this month, there's a discussion of this session with Ander, and I encourage you all to use the interactive Q and A to ask questions.
2605130	2610620	257	A	0.77709	You've been asking very good questions that I hope I've been managing to answer.
2611550	2613418	258	A	0.98134	So thank you very much.
2613504	2614422	259	A	0.77	And Daniel.
2614486	2615500	260	A	0.99986	Over to you.
2617150	2617562	261	A	0.96205	Cool.
2617616	2617882	262	A	0.99919	Well.
2617936	2630720	263	B	0.99987	We have a few minutes for some questions maybe and or if you want to bring up any questions first, then go for it.
2633330	2642718	264	C	0.97	I was curious if you could say any words on the slide where you had all the possible alignments of QRFs and what you meant more by interacting thermally.
2642814	2649350	265	C	0.99683	So when you have a trivial agent on one side, what exactly does it mean to say that you're interacting thermally?
2654080	2677830	266	A	1	If you think about a system that is only interacting thermally with its environment, you end up thinking classically about, for example, an ideal gas that's in some sort of container and some of the molecules are very near the surface and their motions depend on the motions of all the other molecules that are inside.
2678600	2694040	267	A	0.98975	So there's a set of internal states that interact randomly with the external states that are near the boundary and so those external states interact randomly with the boundary.
2694700	2708750	268	A	0.99999	But notice in thinking in this way, you've imposed a spacetime embedding, so you've actually used space as a way of separating the internal states from the boundary states.
2710500	2729700	269	A	1	And a system that if you drop this assumption of a spatial boundary, then a system that's only interacting thermally with its environment is going to look like a system that doesn't have any real internal states.
2729850	2733030	270	A	0.87714	It's going to look like a system that just has boundary states.
2733660	2738200	271	A	1	And so a pure thermal interaction is going to start to look like entanglement.
2739180	2747384	272	A	0.99058	So we're actually only really interested in systems that aren't interacting only purely thermally with their environments.
2747512	2756860	273	A	0.38375	We're interested in systems that have enough internal structure that they're using that thermal energy to do something internally.
2757440	2777510	274	A	0.7337	So to give their internal dynamics some particular shape, so that their internal dynamics is actually circling around some well defined attractor that requires some energy to maintain itself.
2780200	2782244	275	C	0.95012	Yeah, I'm continuing with that question.
2782442	2799420	276	C	1	I saw in the paper free energy principle for Quantum Systems that if you're in that situation when both keras are nontrivial, but perhaps B's is larger than a's ace perceives non local hidden variables.
2799760	2808220	277	C	0.99965	So I wonder if there is a way to relate those by taking a limit of making a small and recover the thermal interaction.
2808580	2815264	278	C	0.99972	Presumably if you let A become small, you should recover that thermal interaction, so to speak.
2815302	2815890	279	C	0.99992	Right?
2816820	2819984	280	A	0.77203	Yeah, that's a very interesting comment actually.
2820102	2838016	281	A	0.99886	So if you're a system and all of your environments variables are effectively hidden to you, then you can't do any information processing because you don't have any access to any of your system, your environments variables.
2838208	2841172	282	A	0.99993	So yeah, your interaction can only be thermal.
2841236	2842490	283	A	1	I think that's correct.
2844460	2845450	284	A	0.99996	Thank you.
2852460	2857310	285	C	0.56706	Since we're in this, in this topic and we don't have to context switch in that way.
2857920	2860016	286	C	1	On the other hand, you have noise, right?
2860118	2865250	287	C	0.99985	In one of those other situations, I can't recall which one.
2866340	2868448	288	C	1	I guess in the reversed one, right.
2868614	2878880	289	C	0.99987	When a's QRF is larger than that of B, so it encompasses more of the boundary degrees of freedom, those that are not overlapping A perceives as noises.
2879040	2879604	290	C	0.99874	That's correct.
2879642	2880230	291	C	0.57941	Right?
2881320	2881780	292	A	0.99753	Yeah.
2881850	2889412	293	A	1	A will be looking at B's thermal sector, b's free energy sector.
2889556	2890200	294	A	0.95784	Right.
2890350	2903340	295	A	0.99633	So A may be interpreting, in a sense, what it's doing as informative, and A may even be seeing what B is doing as informative.
2906800	2923890	296	A	0.81107	So noise for B may be signal for A, depending on how a's QRF is structured, but A is seeing more information than B is trying to send it.
2925860	2930390	297	A	0.9997	So it's it's essentially the the reverse of the hidden variable case.
2931400	2942410	298	A	1	There are variables in the other system that aren't telling you anything about what the other system is actually doing.
2946070	2955122	299	B	0.87694	That's very interesting in terms of reading too much or too little between the lines, connecting too many dots or connecting not enough dots.
2955266	2965098	300	B	0.99998	But these challenges where noise for one quantum cognitive agent might be signal for another and vice versa, those are the challenges that we want to address.
2965184	2977950	301	B	0.97841	Because to have a physics that doesn't recognize those situations is kind of taking the view from nowhere or not really addressing the complexity of a cognitive engagement.
2979890	2987330	302	A	0.99858	Yeah, it's describing interactions between, effectively, systems that don't share the same language.
2990390	2993300	303	B	1	I have a question about the free energy principle here.
2994630	3002790	304	B	0.99999	Only in the last several years has the quantum free energy principle relationship come into light.
3002940	3011130	305	B	0.9998	So maybe could you just share a little bit about what incremental or quantum advances enabled that to happen?
3011280	3030400	306	B	0.65942	Or what degrees of freedom were preexisting or added to enable work arising from perception and action in neural systems to also so naturally enter this context with the quantum information?
3032450	3047620	307	A	0.99997	Well, I think, at least from historical point of view, that connection was made based on the analogy between a Markov blanket and a Holographic screen.
3048570	3061420	308	A	0.99997	So these are structures developed in different parts of physics that essentially serve the same function of limiting the information that one system can have about another system.
3063230	3086930	309	A	0.67451	So it's that functional analogy between a Markov blanket defined classically and a Holographic screen defined in quantum theory that made it seem obvious that we could translate the free energy principle into a quantum theoretic principle.
3095350	3095954	310	B	0.99998	Yes.
3096072	3124650	311	B	0.99999	In live stream 40, we talked a lot about this, but I think that remains one of the most remarkable advances inside or outside the free energy principle literature based upon this functional acknowledgment of boundaries and the conditions that they entail, which, again, are the challenges that we want to address lest we ignore boundaries.
3124990	3125642	312	A	0.9946	Right?
3125776	3126774	313	A	0.99622	Yeah, precisely.
3126822	3131630	314	A	0.53	I mean, the free energy principle is all about what happens when you have a boundary.
3137410	3139230	315	B	0.79	The waste heat.
3141270	3148210	316	B	0.97957	Is this the actual thermal exhaust from our CPU?
3148710	3162338	317	B	0.99992	Or how can we think about the heat being released topologically rather than geometrically, like the location where it's released?
3162434	3171740	318	B	0.99811	What does it mean to consider physical processes topologically that we might otherwise just use a geometric way of thinking about?
3173870	3194530	319	A	0.99956	Well, you basically put your finger on it and that you're not worried about the spatial difference between the geometric spatial difference between where one kind of information flows through the boundary and where another kind of information flows through the boundary.
3195590	3199460	320	A	0.59	And you can think about this in Markov blanket terms.
3201030	3203730	321	A	0.47	And the Markov blanket is just a network.
3204650	3215830	322	A	0.93	And some of the causal arrows flowing through that blanket network are effectively transmitting noise.
3219290	3228374	323	A	0.97	And you can think in the same way with respect to a holographic screen if you're doing a certain amount of information processing.
3228422	3240522	324	A	1	And this this brings up the whole issue of how how efficient is a system in its information processing?
3240586	3243630	325	A	1	How close is it to the land hour limit?
3243710	3244340	326	A	0.99999	Basically?
3247350	3262950	327	A	0.99998	Can it extract more energy from some bits than it has to use to modify the states of other bits?
3264090	3270060	328	A	0.99745	That's what this, if you will, metabolic question is all about.
3272190	3287150	329	A	0.99999	In the case of an organism, is it can I get more energy from some of the chemistry that I have access to than I need to use to modify the chemistry that I need to modify?
3288290	3291622	330	A	1	And if not, then life stops.
3291786	3293650	331	A	0.99998	Everything grinds to a halt.
3300810	3310066	332	B	0.98	Now, can the heat exhaust informationally be useful for another agent somehow?
3310178	3316234	333	B	0.87	I mean, can't we recover heat in a steam engine and use it to do useful work?
3316432	3321334	334	B	0.99999	Not to the point of a perpetual motion machine, but how can we recover exhaust?
3321462	3324640	335	B	1	And then what does the perpetual motion machine look like?
3327010	3340420	336	A	0.99993	Well, the environment is the system sitting over on the other side of the boundary that is absorbing whatever waste heat is generated by the system.
3341910	3345620	337	A	0.99992	Let's call it Alice that we're interested in.
3346310	3366780	338	A	0.99838	So that environment may be alice can't tell this, but it may be divided up into lots of different compartments, some of which are basically sucking in Alice's waste heat and doing something with it.
3368190	3386162	339	A	0.99963	So this is really a question about how is the environment structured and what operations does the environment execute with the input that it gets?
3386216	3388450	340	A	0.99998	How does it interpret that input?
3392200	3393430	341	B	0.66	And what would.
3395800	3413150	342	A	0.99085	This gets back to this question about how do we talk about multiple agents that are communicating with each other instead of talking about an environment that we don't characterize at all?
3415200	3427730	343	A	0.9998	How do we talk about an environment that includes some specified or preferred systems that are treated as or known to be other agents?
3430900	3434800	344	A	0.99997	Let me get back to your question about perpetual motion machine.
3435460	3448580	345	A	0.99999	Notice that in classical thermodynamics there's always the assumption that there's a big environment out there the rest of the universe or whatever, the whole environment that's not on Earth.
3449820	3463790	346	A	0.71684	That is an arbitrarily large source of or it's not an arbitrarily large source of free energy, but it's a large source of free energy.
3464400	3470216	347	A	0.86	And it's a large sink for entropy, a kind of arbitrarily large sink for entropy.
3470408	3489028	348	A	0.98978	So the second law of thermodynamics says the entropy of this entire system counting the whole surrounding environment doesn't decrease, so it can increase and still satisfy the second law.
3489114	3495750	349	A	0.99996	So this gives you the classical 19th century heat death of the Universe idea.
3497000	3517820	350	A	0.81	And so your proposed machine is sitting somewhere embedded in this gigantic environment that can provide some finite amount of free energy but can exhaust effectively an arbitrary amount of entropy.
3519520	3535116	351	A	0.99865	So any machine has to dissipate entropy as it runs to fill up this kind of arbitrary sink of entropy that's the classical rest of the Universe.
3535228	3538180	352	A	1	Now, compare that to the picture in Quantum theory.
3538680	3543670	353	A	1	The picture in Quantum theory is the Universe, by definition, is an isolated system.
3544600	3551480	354	A	0.99997	So its total information content doesn't change, right?
3551550	3552564	355	A	0.99856	It's evolving.
3552612	3560170	356	A	0.81044	unitarily unitary operations preserve information, so they're just moving information around.
3562800	3578800	357	A	0.99016	So from the point of view of any local system, the local system is getting information from its environment, so it sees its environment losing information, so gaining entropy.
3580900	3592400	358	A	0.99871	What this tells us is that entropy is, in fact, not a globally definable quantity.
3592480	3598260	359	A	0.88023	Entropy is always defined relative to some observer, some division, some boundary.
3600140	3611850	360	A	1	And this is another kind of big change in the last few decades and has led to, for example, entropic definitions of time.
3612400	3622590	361	A	0.99993	My local external time arrow is whatever direction I see entropy increasing the most.
3629210	3637110	362	A	0.9981	So, again, I would refer to people like Rovelli and Max Taymar, who developed many of these ideas.
3640350	3641100	363	B	0.99996	Awesome.
3642430	3658222	364	B	0.91811	All right, thank you, Chris, and Ander looking forward to seeing everyone's questions submitted and their preparation and participation and measurement in the discussion section.
3658366	3660162	365	B	0.92146	So thank you.
3660296	3661026	366	B	0.85724	Till next time.
3661048	3661634	367	A	0.81832	All right.
3661752	3663102	368	A	0.99972	Thanks again, Daniel.
3663246	3663714	369	A	0.99441	Thank you.
3663752	3665938	370	A	0.22094	Ander, we'll see you later.
3666104	3666930	371	C	0.95594	Bye.
