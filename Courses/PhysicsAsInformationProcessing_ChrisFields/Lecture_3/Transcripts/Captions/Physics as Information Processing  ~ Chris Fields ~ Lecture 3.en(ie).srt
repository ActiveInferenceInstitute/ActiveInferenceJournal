00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,059
sections so thank you again Chris to you

11
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,300
oh thank you and welcome to physics as

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,520
information processing session three

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,540
which is about Quantum reference frames

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,239
so in this course we've talked about

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,760
Quantum information Theory

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,539
which we characterized as a general

17
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,199
theory that describes the exchange of

18
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,539
information in exchange of finite

19
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,699
information

20
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,519
um between two finite agents that are

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,860
separated by some boundary

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,080
and we've emphasize that this is a

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
topological Theory not a geometric

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,360
Theory so it makes no assumptions about

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,020
an embedding space-time

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,159
and last time I'll we showed how to

27
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,020
characterize this boundary of script B

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,619
as an array of in

29
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,700
some finite and Quantum bits or qubits

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,920
and how to characterize the interaction

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,040
of the agents A and B

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,860
with the boundary

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,979
as an alternating cycle of of preparing

34
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,979
and measuring these this the qubits in

35
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,420
this array

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,700
and we showed that their interaction

37
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,979
could be represented as a sum of

38
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,159
operators Each of which act on just one

39
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,380
of the qubits

40
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,320
and we also talked about

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,740
the need for each of the agents A and B

42
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,739
to choose a reference frame for their

43
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,099
interaction with the qubits that defined

44
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,200
uh which way was up

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,099
so what the orientations of the qubits

46
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,660
meant

47
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,560
and emphasize that the two Observers

48
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,620
uh A and B could choose different

49
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,220
reference frames so different ways of

50
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,220
measuring and preparing their qubits

51
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,300
that use different meanings for the idea

52
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,739
of up

53
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,500
uh for each qubit

54
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,640
and we ended the last session with a

55
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,040
pointer forward toward the quantum

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,980
formulation of the free energy principle

57
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,379
which can be stated as the claim that

58
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,780
interacting systems behave in a way that

59
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,480
aligns their reference frames

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,080
and I'll point it out at that time

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,660
that what this means is that the two

62
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,739
agents A and B approach entanglement

63
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,360
asymptotically and that therefore the

64
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,700
fep is a classical limit of the

65
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,680
principle of unitarity

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,780
which is the core principle of quantum

67
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,599
theory so we'll see in this session why

68
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,180
this is true

69
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,940
so what we'll talk about today

70
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,519
is what reference frames are in general

71
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,680
how they make observations and actions

72
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,080
meaningful so how they give physics a

73
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,519
semantics

74
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,260
and then we'll talk about the free

75
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,040
energy principle

76
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,560
so what is a reference frame

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,060
the idea

78
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,819
that physics involves reference frames

79
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,760
goes back at least a Galileo

80
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,340
but was probably familiar well before

81
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,980
that just not formalized in the way that

82
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,099
Galileo formalized it

83
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,879
so the key idea can be thought of uh in

84
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,560
terms of motion

85
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,379
and you're all familiar for example with

86
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,959
riding a bicycle or driving a car

87
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,019
and seeing the world as if it's passing

88
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,779
by you at some velocity with some

89
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,918
velocity

90
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,839
and of course with respect to the world

91
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,800
you're passing by it with some velocity

92
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,000
and this idea that velocity is not

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,120
absolute but that's relative

94
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,780
to some Observer who measures it in some

95
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,220
reference frame

96
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,259
is the foundation for theories of

97
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,020
Relativity so

98
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,160
Galileo developed his theory of

99
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,540
relativity

100
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,240
which basically was just a way of

101
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,460
converting from classical velocities

102
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,440
measured by one Observer to classical

103
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,440
velocities measured by another Observer

104
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,720
uh that was moving with respect to the

105
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,620
first one

106
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,840
and this provided the foundation for

107
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,120
Einstein's theories of relativity

108
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,919
uh which modified Galileo's by adding

109
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,380
the concept that The Observers have to

110
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,139
change exchange information

111
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,660
uh and can only exchange it at the speed

112
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,160
of light which is finite

113
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,360
so

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,620
this idea in physics has a long history

115
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,960
of course the core idea is that

116
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,720
measurements are always with respect to

117
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,460
something or other

118
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,380
and there's something rather is a

119
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,080
reference frame and different agents can

120
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,300
choose different reference frames

121
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,419
and this idea is very old here we have a

122
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,479
picture of Anubis uh choosing a feather

123
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,580
as the reference frame with which to rep

124
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,699
to to measure the heart of the Pharaoh

125
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,360
so this goes back to well before uh the

126
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,180
Common Era this is about

127
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,440
2000 BCE

128
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,020
so this is a very old idea that's been

129
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,460
elaborated

130
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,160
over the centuries as science has

131
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,360
developed

132
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,460
and in the 90s a fairly big change in

133
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,759
how this idea was thought about occurred

134
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,280
In classical physics reference frames

135
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,560
were always thought of as mathematical

136
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,139
abstractions

137
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:24,720
and an observer and a reference frame

138
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,259
were more or less identified by Galileo

139
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,539
and that identification is carried

140
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,500
forward into Einstein who thinks about

141
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,539
observers for example sitting on photons

142
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,960
and observers in spaceships and

143
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,300
observers riding on railroad trains and

144
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,460
this sort of thing and always that just

145
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,160
means think of a reference frame that's

146
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,620
doing something or other

147
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,600
so

148
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,520
I'll

149
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,280
a reference frame in classical physics

150
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,199
is essentially just

151
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,479
a coordinate system

152
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,380
and these abstract coordinate systems

153
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,199
can be employed in thought experiments

154
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,440
and so they are a way to illustrate

155
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,520
classical intuitions about motion

156
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,220
and in the 90s as Quantum information

157
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,020
theory developed

158
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,319
it was realized that

159
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,979
a reference frame actually consists of a

160
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,199
physical object I mean even in the

161
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,160
picture

162
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,220
from the Egyptian tomb the reference

163
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,400
frame is a physical feather

164
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,060
and that means that the reference frame

165
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,620
itself

166
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,319
is described by quantum theory it's some

167
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,780
Quantum system

168
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,780
and if you think about reference frames

169
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,419
that are familiar for example meter

170
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,819
sticks for measuring distance or clocks

171
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,380
for measuring time

172
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,960
or gyroscopes or batteries or even the

173
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,000
Earth's gravitational fields which

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
typically defines up for us

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,220
those are all physical objects that can

176
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,860
be described by quantum theory

177
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,500
well this was an important insight

178
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,940
of because it led to the realization

179
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,259
that reference frames as Quantum systems

180
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,479
are unique

181
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,599
and uniqueness in quantum theory is very

182
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,699
strong

183
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,919
um there's the no cloning theorem which

184
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,500
states that you can't reproduce exactly

185
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,640
reproduce any unknown Quantum state

186
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,419
and that applies to reference frames uh

187
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,200
because they encode what Bartlett at all

188
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,300
in that paper called non-fungible

189
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,680
information

190
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,140
which just means information that can't

191
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,200
be completely represented in any finite

192
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,120
bit strain

193
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,399
so unless you know the state of a

194
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,680
reference frame you can't clone it

195
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,040
uh since these reference frames

196
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,360
um

197
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,300
encode more than any bit strings worth

198
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,980
of information

199
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,140
in their Quantum phases

200
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,000
of

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
their unique and their states are

202
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,200
unknown

203
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,080
and the consequence of this is that if

204
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,740
Alice wants Bob to use her reference

205
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,019
frame to make a measurement

206
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,959
she can't just send him a description

207
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,660
she has to actually send the reference

208
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,399
right

209
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,200
and this has an important uh consequence

210
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,760
for physics

211
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,100
uh because it makes all replicate

212
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,019
measurements approximate

213
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,560
because observers obviously aren't using

214
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,040
exactly the same physical objects as

215
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,839
their reference frames

216
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,000
that there's a deeper implication of

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,860
this

218
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,860
which is that

219
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,899
Alice's ultimate Rock Bottom reference

220
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,839
frame is actually implemented by her

221
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,660
body by her brain

222
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,220
and using any external reference frame

223
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,200
requires having this internal reference

224
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,779
frame that makes the external reference

225
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,140
frame meaningful and usable so for

226
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,160
example

227
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,680
this thing is a piece of a meter stick a

228
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,200
third of a meter stick but for me to use

229
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,000
it to make measurements

230
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,940
I have to actually have some concept of

231
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,080
distance

232
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,420
and that concept of distance is

233
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,120
implemented by my nervous system

234
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,620
and that implementation is my reference

235
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,779
frame for length

236
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:46,560
and it's what gives meaning to any

237
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,740
external measurement of length it's what

238
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,380
makes my measurements of length

239
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,060
actionable by me using my effectors or

240
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,240
action capabilities whatever they are

241
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,500
so my internal reference frames are what

242
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,660
make information I get from the world

243
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,160
actionable

244
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,459
and in in bateson's sense of differences

245
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:14,220
that make a difference actionability is

246
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,620
the core of semantics something is

247
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,839
Meaningful if I can do something about

248
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,040
it

249
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,339
so this idea that we all

250
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,060
uh contain

251
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,860
embodied reference frames

252
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,160
gives physics as semantics by giving

253
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,600
observers or semantics and this is new

254
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,079
uh this is an idea that never really

255
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,519
appeared in physics before the

256
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,339
measurements automatically had to have

257
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,620
some kind of semantics

258
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,640
but reference frames uh give semantics

259
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,420
to measurements

260
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,279
so here's an example of an embodied

261
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,899
reference frame

262
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,240
this is the reference frame that

263
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,019
bacteria used for chemotaxis I.E to move

264
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,160
toward

265
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,500
molecules in the environment that they

266
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,360
like like sugars

267
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,760
and to move away from molecules that

268
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,339
they don't like like acids

269
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,500
and it's been worked out in great detail

270
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
over Decades of experimental work and

271
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,899
this is a rough schematic

272
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,500
of the reference frame has three parts

273
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,940
of there's the measurement part which is

274
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,220
conveniently located in the front of the

275
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,019
bacterium

276
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,240
and it consists of a bunch of receptors

277
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,339
that probe the environment

278
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,760
and they can bind molecules which are

279
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,579
called ligands out in the environment

280
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,519
and when they bind them they send a

281
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,220
signal into the back of the bacterium

282
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,959
and it turns out that there's a little

283
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,240
miniature reference frame attached

284
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,579
directly to these ligands which is this

285
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,760
R and B system which controls the like

286
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,459
the ligands the not the leggings the

287
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,920
receptor sensitivity

288
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,800
then the back of the reference frame is

289
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,839
the action component

290
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
and it consists of a set of molecules

291
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,120
that control a motor

292
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,760
a molecular motor that derives the

293
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,760
flagella on the bacteria

294
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,820
and the flagellum allows it to swim

295
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,079
forwards or turn in some other direction

296
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,800
and depending on how it spins uh the the

297
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,959
creature either goes in the direction of

298
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,120
something it likes or it stops and turns

299
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,440
around

300
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,839
and the stuff in the middle

301
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,220
is

302
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,000
a little molecular feedback loop

303
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,320
that represents the amount of ligand in

304
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,120
the environment that the bacterium

305
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,160
expects to see

306
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,079
so this is the middle of the reference

307
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,839
frame and it defines the default value

308
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,260
for what the bacterium is observing in

309
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,060
its environment

310
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,820
and if you're thinking in terms of the

311
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,740
free energy principle or Bayesian

312
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,320
inference then you'll immediately see

313
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,600
the concentration of this molecule is

314
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,000
encoding a prior probability

315
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
the bacterium's prior probability for

316
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,399
what its environment is like

317
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,139
and the zero point the default value of

318
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,440
that encoding is the ligand

319
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,300
concentration in which the bacterium

320
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,339
does nothing

321
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,300
so a qrf in general

322
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,700
can be characterized as an expected

323
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,699
value which is here the concentration of

324
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,199
this molecule

325
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,920
key y phosphorylated plus a bunch of

326
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,260
computation which is all the rest of the

327
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,120
things in this diagram

328
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,959
foreign

329
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,380
so this is a very simple qrf that's

330
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,480
embodied by a bacterium

331
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,660
here's a more complicated qrf

332
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,980
that's embodied by

333
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,360
eukaryotic cells who are more

334
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,060
complicated cells like our cells

335
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,240
and this is the reference frame

336
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,779
that makes decisions about whether cells

337
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,060
are going to divide

338
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,459
so on the top you see the cell's

339
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:21,899
membrane and there are all sorts of

340
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,040
receptors sticking out of it that detect

341
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,660
hormones and neurotransmitters and

342
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,579
growth factors and this that and the

343
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,500
other thing many of which are produced

344
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,600
by other cells

345
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,120
and those receptors

346
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,680
um communicate via a lot of chemistry

347
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,180
with uh the nucleus which is contained

348
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,519
in another

349
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,180
membrane

350
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,220
and so serves as in a sense the outside

351
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,160
upon which the reference frame is acting

352
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,040
and what this reference frame does is

353
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,300
control

354
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,699
the transcription of large numbers of

355
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,800
molecules from DNA so it basically

356
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,019
controls what proteins the cell is

357
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:07,800
making

358
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,660
and those proteins end up doing

359
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,279
something like restructuring the

360
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,860
cytoplasm and actually driving cell

361
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,240
division

362
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,279
and the stuff in the middle of this

363
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,959
reference frame

364
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,699
which I've labeled the integrative

365
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:21,959
Center

366
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,279
are three molecules called RAF Mech and

367
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,420
irk

368
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,100
and they're connected by positive by

369
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,899
bi-directional feedback loops

370
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,860
and they basically negotiate the default

371
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,360
value

372
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,199
of the environment at which the cell

373
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,360
does nothing

374
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,639
so they're the middle of the reference

375
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,660
frame

376
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,180
that represents the cell's expectation

377
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,240
values about what's going on in its

378
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,480
environment so you can imagine now what

379
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,940
reference frames encoded by our nervous

380
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,800
system look like they're extremely

381
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,180
complicated

382
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,299
and existed multiple scales from the

383
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,780
scale of molecules in cells to the scale

384
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,240
of large-scale connections between

385
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,120
parts of of our brains

386
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,459
so how do we represent all this stuff

387
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,459
uh there are many ways to do this

388
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,919
but this is a particular particularly

389
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,720
simple way

390
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,020
of it assumes that whatever's in the

391
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,020
middle which is here called C Prime

392
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,240
is

393
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,740
the most General thing that the inputs

394
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,900
can give information to

395
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,260
and the most General thing that can give

396
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,960
information to the outputs

397
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,440
and most General here has a category

398
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,020
theoretic definition

399
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,440
um so it could be

400
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,559
stated in a way that's equivalent across

401
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,980
many different uh specific mathematical

402
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,600
forms

403
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,820
but if you're familiar with neural

404
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,520
networks this will look to you a lot

405
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,500
like the skeleton of a variational

406
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,419
autoencoder

407
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,539
and that's basically what it is

408
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:21,000
and I don't want to deal with this

409
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,880
formalism except to say that it exists

410
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,039
and is very convenient

411
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,960
uh except to say that we can attach

412
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,360
this kind of formal diagram

413
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,380
as a representation of a qrf to our

414
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,960
representation of the boundary between

415
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,539
two interacting agents

416
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:47,280
and we can use these formal structures

417
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,280
uh to drive the measurement operators

418
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,919
that actually Implement physical changes

419
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,820
on this boundary

420
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,520
and I'll represent this whole business

421
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,940
with just a triangle labeled Q for some

422
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,900
qrf that's attached to the boundary

423
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,440
and we can use this simple notation then

424
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,740
to investigate what sorts of structures

425
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,220
one gets when one starts to think about

426
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,380
systems as implementing specific qrfs

427
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,799
and here's the structure of the minimal

428
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,440
system that we can really think of as an

429
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,840
interesting Observer

430
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,179
and this is a system that has some qrf

431
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:37,559
that I've called e

432
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,080
that looks at its environment the part

433
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,500
of its environment that it can actually

434
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,380
observe and act on

435
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,480
and it defines a sector of the boundary

436
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,880
how which mathematically is just the

437
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,559
image of this qrfe

438
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,440
that of the system can manipulate so

439
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,660
this is the part of the environment

440
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,460
or the part of the boundary that the

441
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,679
system actually seeps and can do

442
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,840
something about

443
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,140
and for this for this Observer to be

444
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,220
interesting

445
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,919
it needs to be able to detect the

446
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,919
difference between well it sees now

447
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,400
and what it saw just then

448
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,860
so that it can decide whether to take

449
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,780
some action or other

450
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,760
so it needs a memory

451
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,059
and that requires another qrf

452
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,880
that has some allocated piece of the

453
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,100
boundary recall the boundary is where

454
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,400
classical information gets written and

455
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,960
this purely Quantum theoretic formalism

456
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,080
so it needs a memory sector that that

457
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,480
qrf can act on

458
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,919
and then in order to do this computation

459
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,840
and specifically in order to write

460
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,400
information

461
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,980
to the boundary in order to actually

462
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,380
flip bits on the boundary

463
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,600
it needs free energy

464
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,419
so the rest of its boundary gets devoted

465
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,240
to

466
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,440
extracting free energy from the

467
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,559
environment and exhausting free energy

468
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,080
waste heat in other words into the

469
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,539
environment and so it has this nice

470
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,580
little thermodynamic cycle that drives

471
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,740
everything else

472
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,419
and finally

473
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:31,440
in order to tell now from just a second

474
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,919
ago this the information in memory

475
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,980
it needs a clock

476
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,980
that marks the information in memory as

477
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,720
not current so as past information

478
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,720
and if it can store multiple memory

479
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,780
records it needs to be able to count

480
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,659
and say this piece of remembered

481
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,480
information is actually more recent than

482
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,520
that piece over there

483
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,340
so it has to implement a little internal

484
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,640
clock and that clock is its internal

485
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,860
time qrf

486
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,320
and we've seen that qrfs act on

487
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,900
boundaries this clock acts on a boundary

488
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,659
but it doesn't act on B

489
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,480
it acts on an internal boundary

490
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,919
of

491
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,080
that's essentially the boundary between

492
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,380
it the clock and the points that the

493
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,260
ends of these qrfs that actually encode

494
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,360
information that's either read from the

495
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,159
environment or written to the

496
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,080
environment

497
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,220
so already this minimal Observer has a

498
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,240
little bit of hierarchical structure

499
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,520
which is that it's clock has to in some

500
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,100
sense be higher up in the hierarchy

501
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,400
then the parts the qrfs that interact

502
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,700
directly with the environment

503
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,480
so if you have a structure like this

504
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,360
you face a metabolic trade-off

505
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,000
for a fixed amount of of energy that you

506
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,280
can extract from the environment

507
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,400
you can allocate it either into learning

508
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,260
more about the environment

509
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,840
or remembering more about what you

510
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,940
learned before

511
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,500
and

512
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,460
so any system has to make this decision

513
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,200
about how they're going to use energy

514
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,059
are they going to devote it to learning

515
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,659
more or remembering more and your laptop

516
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:30,419
makes that decision memory is cheap for

517
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:31,740
your laptop

518
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,380
uh your brain makes that decision memory

519
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,480
is much more expensive for your brain

520
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,940
and all cells have to make that decision

521
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,500
and the universal solution to this uh

522
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,860
trade-off is course grading memory I.E

523
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,080
remembering things in less detail than

524
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,720
you saw them in the beginning uh Ander

525
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,039
you have a comment

526
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,100
uh yes uh I wanted to ask a question now

527
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,200
before it gets too late so two or three

528
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,059
slides ago

529
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,179
um when we were looking at the diagram

530
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,539
of the cone cocon diagrams I was

531
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,100
wondering if

532
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,480
um the

533
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,580
the classifiers identified with

534
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,260
measurement and preparation lows

535
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,960
correspond to sensory and action degrees

536
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,820
of freedom in the earlier picture with

537
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,159
bacteria and the

538
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,620
the classifier in the Middle with that

539
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,000
in that in that picture really

540
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,740
correspond to the default chemical

541
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,980
concentration that yes exactly

542
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,200
okay perfect yeah that uh

543
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,179
that crossing point in the middle is

544
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:37,919
specifically where the default is

545
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,840
encoded

546
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,740
thank you for pointing that out

547
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,179
okay

548
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:49,020
okay uh so let's follow the consequences

549
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,840
of this metabolic issue

550
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,039
of

551
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,140
if you have a system that's a little bit

552
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,320
smarter than our minimal system that can

553
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,299
actually detect and measure the states

554
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,220
of objects

555
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,700
it has to do even more work because it

556
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,820
has to encode even more qrfs

557
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,400
so think of measuring the state of some

558
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,000
object like a voltmeter in a laboratory

559
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,860
if I tell you to go into the lab and

560
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,440
tell me what the volt meter is reading

561
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,179
then the first thing you have to do is

562
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:24,600
find the voltmeter and your process of

563
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,600
finding the voltmeter is independent of

564
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,400
your process of reading what it's

565
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,179
actually saying on its dial

566
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,580
so in order to measure the state of an

567
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,240
object you have to have two qrfs one

568
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,640
that lets you find the object

569
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,980
and then the other that lets you measure

570
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,260
the state of interest of the object

571
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,039
and we call these the r sector for

572
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,500
reference that lets you find the object

573
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,520
in the P sector for pointer because old

574
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,640
old instruments used to have pointers on

575
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,960
dials that read analog numbers

576
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,620
foreign

577
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,120
but

578
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,320
what thinking about object

579
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,559
identification tells you is that every

580
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,200
object that you can identify

581
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,100
uh leads to having to sector both the

582
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,279
informative part of your boundary and

583
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,440
the memory part of your boundary into

584
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,059
two new sectors

585
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,299
one to store information about object

586
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,980
identification

587
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,039
and one to store information about the

588
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,200
states of those objects

589
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,100
so this requires much more metabolism

590
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,880
and again the solution is coarse green

591
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,980
and typically what would be coarse green

592
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,100
is our memory of the object that we've

593
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,580
identified

594
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,960
so what does this do to systems

595
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,980
um

596
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,419
because

597
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:04,140
making measurements costs energy

598
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,360
and recording memories costs energy

599
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,419
we have to make decisions about

600
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,320
what qrfs to use at what time given our

601
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,919
finite energy budgets we can't look at

602
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,720
the world with all of our measurement

603
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,059
capabilities at the same time because

604
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,340
it's too expensive

605
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,919
and now

606
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,659
uh

607
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,419
we see the effect of a theorem in

608
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,460
Quantum information Theory

609
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,700
which is that if two qrfs can't be

610
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,980
deployed simultaneously for whatever

611
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,659
reason

612
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:46,140
uh that corresponds to them not

613
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,020
commuting as operators

614
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,380
and if they don't commute as operators

615
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,820
they have to be implemented by

616
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,159
compartments that are sufferable so

617
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,080
compartments that only communicate

618
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,720
classically

619
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,299
the consequence of this theorem

620
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,179
is that as soon as

621
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,919
one has

622
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,299
too many

623
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,000
sensory and motor capabilities to run

624
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,220
all at the same time given your energy

625
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,960
budget

626
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,080
uh you end up being compartmentalized

627
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,419
into compartments that only communicate

628
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:23,820
classically so you end up looking like

629
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,679
this diagram

630
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,200
where there are a bunch of components

631
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,880
that do sensory motor Loops or memory

632
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,980
one or the other

633
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,440
and they can only communicate

634
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,700
classically

635
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,000
and they're controlled by some sort of

636
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,620
attention system

637
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,120
that selects which ones to activate

638
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,220
depending on the amount of free energy

639
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,260
that's available

640
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,440
and clearly this clock function

641
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,279
uh becomes part of this control system

642
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,940
so the physics alone

643
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:08,460
of any system that's acting as a fair

644
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,860
that executes a fairly complicated

645
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,080
interaction with its environment

646
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,559
gives us this hierarchical

647
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,659
compartmentalized structure

648
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,320
without having to add any

649
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,179
biological or cognitive science type

650
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,320
assumptions at all

651
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,760
so we could go in three directions from

652
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,659
this

653
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,299
uh we can go deeper into the biology

654
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,520
which we're going to do in October

655
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,039
we can go deeper into the physics which

656
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,480
we're going to do in August and

657
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,860
September

658
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,640
and we can go deeper into this issue of

659
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,380
alignment which is what we're going to

660
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,360
do today

661
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,179
so there are four possibilities if you

662
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:54,120
think about two agents that have qrfs

663
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,960
that are interacting with across this

664
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,100
boundary

665
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,760
and the first one is Trivial if the the

666
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,000
B agent the agent on the right side uh

667
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,140
doesn't actually employ any qrfs if it

668
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,460
just interacts with the boundary

669
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,080
thermally

670
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,539
uh then there is no alignment you're in

671
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,059
a trivial situation where a can measure

672
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:22,158
something about B but not in return

673
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,480
if the B agent deploys a qrf that's much

674
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,299
broader in scope than the a agent what

675
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,399
we show here in panel B

676
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,740
then the a agent can learn something

677
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,919
about the B agent but misses most of

678
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,539
what the B agent is doing

679
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,960
um in panel C we have agents with qrfs

680
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,440
of the same size on the boundary but

681
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,779
they're not lined up correctly so each

682
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,820
one misses part of what the other is

683
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,200
doing

684
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,720
and finally in D we have the optimal

685
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,940
situation where they have qrfs of the

686
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,200
same size

687
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,380
and they're actually lined up so each

688
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,260
sees what the other is doing at least on

689
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,360
this sector of the boundary

690
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,539
and since the agents have to to allocate

691
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:13,919
some of the boundary to free energy

692
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,620
Supply and can't look at that part

693
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,440
then they can't tell what's happening uh

694
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,960
across their entire boundaries they can

695
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,520
only tell what's happening in this

696
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,419
sector

697
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:28,919
uh where they can actually deploy a qrf

698
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,200
but let's now look at this interesting

699
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,100
uh situation situation d

700
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,520
uh where the qrfs are a large between a

701
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,399
and b

702
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,620
as I said that's the optimal channel for

703
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,720
a and b

704
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,919
and if we think about this we can write

705
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,740
the variational free energy or the

706
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,980
uncertainty or the prediction error

707
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,299
of

708
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,220
4A

709
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,279
for the qrfx

710
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,659
as

711
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:07,140
the action that it sees

712
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,600
I.E

713
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,159
B's action

714
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,860
the difference between that and what it

715
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,659
expects beta2

716
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,299
so what it can predict about these

717
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:19,380
actions

718
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,799
and this is just of the notion of free

719
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,820
energy

720
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,340
uh from the free energy principle except

721
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,740
translated into

722
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,279
um

723
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,659
the situation where we have two qrfs and

724
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,299
uh

725
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:39,659
a can measure what's B has done but it

726
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:43,500
can also use its qrf to predict

727
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,200
oh because it's predicting the very

728
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,500
state that it's going to observe next of

729
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,340
the same sector that b is using

730
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,240
now if we look at this diagram uh we can

731
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,100
see easily

732
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,500
that the way to minimize the variational

733
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,940
free energy

734
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,279
and therefore maximize predictive

735
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,899
capability

736
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:10,799
is for these two qrfs to actually be the

737
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,120
same

738
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,399
so if a

739
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,620
is doing

740
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,000
the same thing to the boundary that b is

741
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,059
a can predict these next action

742
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:27,059
perfectly because it's B is going to do

743
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:29,940
whatever a is doing

744
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,940
so

745
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,899
what the free energy principle tells us

746
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:38,640
in this case

747
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,240
is that a and b

748
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,340
as they minimize their variational free

749
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,720
Energies

750
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,220
will approach having identical qrfs

751
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,519
well again we have a theorem that tells

752
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,779
us that if these qrfs are shared A and B

753
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:01,140
are not separable but entangled

754
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,659
and this is this is also fairly easy to

755
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:06,059
see because it depends on this notion of

756
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:07,860
non-fungibility

757
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,060
uh if if x a and x b both encode

758
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,800
non-fungible information which is

759
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,199
quantum systems they do

760
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,379
oh their states aren't clonable

761
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,260
so they can't be copies of being sugar

762
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,918
because one can't clone an unknown

763
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,780
system

764
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,480
so they can only be identical if they're

765
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,659
actually identical systems oh this is

766
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,960
exactly the same point made earlier

767
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,839
about Alice having to actually send her

768
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,859
qrf to Bob if she wants Bob to use her

769
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:46,280
qrf

770
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,440
so

771
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,760
minimizing vfe

772
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,080
or Quantum systems is becoming entangled

773
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,420
so the classical free energy principle

774
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,660
which tells us to minimize vfa actually

775
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,520
drives Quantum systems toward

776
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,780
entanglement

777
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,760
and that's why it's a special case of

778
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,500
the principle of unitarity

779
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,099
which just says that any isolated joint

780
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,500
system is going to asymptotically

781
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,040
approach entanglement

782
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,579
so this raises an obvious question which

783
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,099
is why all of us aren't entangled with

784
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,079
our environments all the time

785
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,500
uh and entangled with each other

786
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,460
and the answer is that entanglement is

787
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,000
really hard for complex systems

788
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,780
and this illustrates uh the the sense in

789
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,839
which the fep is Moving Systems in two

790
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,420
different directions at once

791
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,380
the fep is Driving Systems to maintain

792
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,240
their separability

793
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,700
but it's also Driving Systems toward

794
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,380
entanglement

795
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,960
and as the system becomes more and more

796
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,300
complex the difference between those out

797
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,260
two outcomes becomes larger and larger

798
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,079
so recall from last time

799
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,320
that the condition for separability

800
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,099
is that the two systems have Dimensions

801
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,200
that are much larger than the dimension

802
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,359
of their boundary

803
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:21,060
and this is the condition that allows

804
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,099
them to have internal states to have

805
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,800
them have states that aren't located on

806
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,359
their boundaries

807
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,880
and clearly to formulate the free energy

808
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,940
principle uh you have to have internal

809
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,740
States

810
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,760
so if you're a complex qrf they're doing

811
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,619
a lot of computation

812
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,660
then you need a lot of internal degrees

813
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,579
of freedom to implement their

814
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:45,900
computation

815
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,020
saving a lot of internal state so you

816
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,960
have to have large dimensions

817
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,359
so complexity

818
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:57,839
favors separability as a system becomes

819
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,720
more complex it has to have more

820
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,300
internal States so it has to be in a

821
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,579
sense more separable from whatever it's

822
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,740
interacting with

823
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,859
now think about this classic one

824
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,680
if you have a complex system that's

825
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,079
doing a lot of computation

826
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,380
then it requires a lot of free energy

827
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,140
and it has to dissipate a lot of entropy

828
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,960
in the form of heat typically

829
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,220
uh

830
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,260
but something

831
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,960
some form of energy transfer that its

832
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,960
environment is going to see as noise as

833
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,660
not informative

834
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,920
so a complex system is working very hard

835
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,099
to predict its environment's next state

836
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:47,160
but by working very hard it's dumping a

837
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,500
lot of entropy into its environment

838
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,859
and putting in that extra entropy makes

839
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:56,099
the environments Behavior even harder to

840
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,500
predict so the more you work at

841
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,180
predicting what the environment is going

842
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,140
to do

843
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,020
the more you yourself make the

844
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,200
environment's behavior less predictable

845
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,440
and this is the the the Paradox of the

846
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,079
fep which is not really a paradox it's

847
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,680
just what the physics does

848
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,619
so we can think of the fep by Driving

849
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:24,240
Systems to increase their distinctness

850
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,700
from their environments or to

851
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,660
self-evidence as Carl friston calls it

852
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,280
um as uh driving this increased

853
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,839
complexity

854
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:39,960
that both makes predictions better

855
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,900
and makes predictions Harder by

856
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,460
transferring entropy into the

857
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,140
environment

858
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,160
so what this tells us is that the fep by

859
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,839
itself

860
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,660
will drive the development of systems

861
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,240
with larger and larger complexity

862
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,740
and this clearly has enormous

863
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,180
implications for evolutionary theory

864
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,079
which we'll talk about in October

865
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,160
um

866
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,260
but I want to emphasize here that this

867
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,140
is just the physics it's just what the

868
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,920
fep does when it's forced to maintain a

869
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,079
boundary

870
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,339
um

871
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:23,579
and before stopping here

872
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:27,060
I want to consider one of

873
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,119
aspect to this in particular

874
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,480
which is language for example human

875
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,680
language but any kind of language

876
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,599
connecting any systems that are

877
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,119
communicating with qrfs that are fairly

878
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,440
close

879
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,220
and language is a complex qrf

880
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,880
that we basically share otherwise things

881
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,740
like this interaction would be

882
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,599
impossible

883
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,900
but we also remain distinct systems

884
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,839
so the question arises how do we manage

885
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:04,320
to do this how do we manage to largely

886
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,540
share a qrf

887
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:10,740
all escaping becoming entangled

888
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,200
and this is a question that's largely

889
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,900
been ignored in physics because

890
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,940
physicists have tended to ignore

891
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,079
language

892
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:23,099
and just assume that observers can

893
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,380
communicate classically so for example

894
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,119
in talking about

895
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,700
a bell APR experiment which is a

896
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,380
canonical experiment for measuring

897
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,300
entanglement

898
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,760
The Observers have to be able to share

899
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,460
their results or they can't observe

900
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,460
entanglement right The Observer the The

901
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,560
observed result is

902
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,500
a bunch of observational statistics that

903
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,079
violate Bell's inequality and those

904
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,140
statistics can only be computed given

905
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,300
the results that both of The Observers

906
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,760
obtain so The Observers have to share

907
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,420
language to encode these results

908
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,359
so how come the observers aren't

909
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,020
entangled uh how come there are still

910
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,300
separable

911
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,880
what we end up appealing to is some sort

912
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,040
of common cause in the past to explain

913
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,260
why they share a language

914
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,420
they both learned it from their culture

915
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,119
so their culture is some sort of common

916
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,619
cause

917
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:25,800
but all such assumptions are fine-tuning

918
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,180
assumptions

919
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,240
so they all have basically

920
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,000
um the status

921
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,579
of

922
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,740
the value of something like the fine

923
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,619
structure constant without which

924
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:42,960
uh we wouldn't have atoms and so we

925
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,579
wouldn't have us

926
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:48,720
of this value has to be within very

927
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,859
small

928
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,200
limits of it of the value we actually

929
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,460
observe

930
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,839
and that's a case of fine-tuning the

931
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,420
universe seems fine-tuned in a way that

932
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,460
allows us to exist

933
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,160
and if it wasn't fine-tuned in that way

934
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,380
we wouldn't exist and so we wouldn't

935
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,240
observe anything

936
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,640
but fine-tending assumptions are a

937
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,099
problem they're a pointer to something

938
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,320
we don't understand

939
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,079
and so I just want to leave you with the

940
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:22,380
point that we have to be very careful

941
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,579
when talking about interacting Observers

942
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:31,140
so in talking about two components of

943
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,440
some system that jointly interact with

944
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,940
some environment

945
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,579
but also communicate classically and if

946
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:41,160
you think back a few slides that's

947
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,500
exactly the structure

948
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,800
that we've shown that the physics forces

949
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,700
any complicated system to have

950
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,060
so next time what we're going to focus

951
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,000
on is this very question

952
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,180
of how we describe Observers

953
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,280
that are both interacting with the

954
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,660
quantum system

955
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,260
and communicating classically in some

956
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,940
language

957
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,200
so that session will be in August at the

958
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,880
end of this month there's a discussion

959
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,099
of this session with Ander

960
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:20,819
and I encourage you all to

961
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:21,660
um

962
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,740
use the interactive q a to ask questions

963
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,480
you've been asking very good questions

964
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,140
that I hope I've been managing to answer

965
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,440
uh so thank you very much and Daniel

966
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,140
over to you

967
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,680
oh well we have a few minutes for some

968
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,480
questions so maybe

969
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,760
um and or if you want to

970
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,800
bring up any questions first

971
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,280
oh I mean then go for it

972
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,079
I was curious if you could say any words

973
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,480
on the slide where you had all the

974
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,900
possible alignment of qrfs and what you

975
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,060
meant more by interacting thermally so

976
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,680
when you have a trivial agent on one

977
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,520
side

978
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,859
what what exactly does it mean to to say

979
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:10,920
that your interacting thermally

980
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,040
um

981
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,160
if you think about a system that is only

982
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,079
interacting thermally with its

983
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:21,300
environment

984
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:21,839
um

985
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,760
you end up thinking classically about

986
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,119
for example an ideal gas that's in some

987
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,640
sort of container and some of the

988
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,579
molecules are very near the surface

989
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:35,040
uh and their emotions depend on the

990
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,079
Motions of all the other molecules that

991
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:38,579
are inside

992
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:43,800
so there's a a set of internal States

993
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,060
that interact randomly with the external

994
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,700
states that are near the boundary and so

995
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,980
those external States interact randomly

996
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,780
with the boundary

997
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,960
but notice in thinking in this way

998
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,740
uh you've imposed a space-time embedded

999
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,579
so you've actually used space as a way

1000
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:07,680
of separating the internal States from

1001
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,399
the boundary States

1002
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,359
and a system that uh

1003
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,000
if you drop this Assumption of this of a

1004
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,619
spatial boundary

1005
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:22,260
then a system that's only interacting

1006
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,839
thermally with its environment

1007
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:27,300
is going to look like a system that

1008
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,460
doesn't have any real internal States

1009
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,560
it's going to look like a system that

1010
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,300
just has boundary States

1011
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,940
and so a pure thermal interaction is

1012
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,839
going to start to look like entanglement

1013
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:42,480
so we're actually only really interested

1014
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,940
in systems that aren't interacting only

1015
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,280
purely thermally with their environments

1016
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,920
we're interested in systems that have

1017
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,220
enough internal structure that they're

1018
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,560
using that thermal energy to do

1019
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,480
something internally

1020
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,500
so to to give their internal Dynamics

1021
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,859
some particular shape

1022
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:07,740
so that their internal Dynamics is

1023
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,119
um

1024
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,760
actually Circle circling around some

1025
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,040
well-defined attractor

1026
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,800
that requires some energy to maintain

1027
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,280
itself

1028
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,500
yeah I'm continuing with that question

1029
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,540
um I saw in the paper free energy

1030
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:28,260
principle for Quantum systems that if

1031
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,839
you're in that situation now when both

1032
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:33,599
cures are non-trivial but but perhaps B

1033
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,160
is larger than A's

1034
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,780
local hidden variables

1035
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,420
so I wonder if there is a way to to

1036
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,160
relate those by taking the limit of

1037
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,339
making a small and recover the thermal

1038
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:48,599
interaction

1039
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,819
presumably

1040
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:53,819
um if you let a become small you should

1041
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:55,140
recover that thermal interaction so to

1042
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,819
speak right

1043
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:58,800
yeah that's that's a very interesting

1044
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,040
comment actually so if if you're a

1045
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,980
system and all of your environments

1046
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,540
variables are effectively hidden to you

1047
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,180
oh then you can't do any information

1048
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,040
processing because you don't have any

1049
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,440
access to any of your system your

1050
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,300
environment's variables

1051
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,520
so yeah your your interaction can only

1052
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,480
be thermal I think that's correct right

1053
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,079
thank you

1054
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,200
uh I guess yeah

1055
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,960
let's just so we since we're in in this

1056
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,880
in this topic and we don't have to

1057
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,800
context switch in that way

1058
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,359
um on the other hand you have noise

1059
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,099
right in in one of those other

1060
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:43,560
situations

1061
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,800
um I can't recall which one I guess I

1062
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,540
guess in the Reversed one right when

1063
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,060
when when as qrf is larger than that of

1064
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,280
B so it encompasses more of the boundary

1065
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,160
decrease of Freedom those that are not

1066
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,920
overlapping a perceives us noise is that

1067
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,839
that's that's correct right

1068
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:04,760
well yeah it will be looking at at uh

1069
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,460
B's thermal sector B's free energy

1070
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,520
sector right so

1071
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,420
a may be interpreting in a sense what

1072
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,300
it's doing is informative

1073
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,540
and it and a may even be seeing what B

1074
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,540
is doing is informative

1075
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:29,520
oh but so so noise for B may be signal

1076
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,599
for a

1077
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:34,500
depending on on what how A's qrf is

1078
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,819
structured

1079
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:37,920
oh but

1080
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,180
a is is seeing more information than b

1081
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,560
is trying to send it

1082
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,599
so it's it's essentially the the reverse

1083
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:51,359
of the Hidden variable case

1084
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,160
there are

1085
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:53,819
um

1086
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:55,740
variables

1087
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,040
in the other system that aren't telling

1088
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,839
you anything about what the other system

1089
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:04,099
is actually doing

1090
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,880
that that's very interesting in terms of

1091
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,800
um reading too much or too little

1092
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,839
between the lines connecting too many

1093
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:15,599
dots or connecting not enough dots but

1094
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,720
these challenges where noise for one

1095
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,240
Quantum cognitive agent might be signal

1096
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,940
for another and vice versa those are the

1097
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,960
challenges that we want to address

1098
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,720
because to have a physics that doesn't

1099
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,619
recognize those situations is kind of

1100
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,420
taking the view from nowhere or not

1101
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,599
really addressing the complexity of a

1102
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,440
cognitive engagement

1103
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,079
yeah it's it's describing interactions

1104
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:44,099
between

1105
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:46,380
effectively systems that don't share the

1106
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,800
same language

1107
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,960
I have a question about the free energy

1108
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,060
principle here

1109
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:54,599
um

1110
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:57,960
only in the last several years as the

1111
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,260
quantum free energy principle

1112
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,540
relationship come into light so maybe

1113
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,060
could you just share a little bit about

1114
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,599
what incremental or Quantum advances

1115
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,660
enable that to happen or what degrees of

1116
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:18,240
freedom were pre-existing or added to

1117
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,079
enable work arising from perception and

1118
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,359
action in neural systems

1119
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:27,660
to also so naturally

1120
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,880
enter this context with the quantum

1121
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,060
information

1122
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:37,460
well I I think the at least from

1123
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:41,160
a historical point of view

1124
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,099
uh that connection was made based on the

1125
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:46,440
analogy between a Markov blanket and a

1126
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,540
holographic screen

1127
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,180
so these are structures developed in

1128
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,520
different parts of of physics that

1129
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,400
essentially serve the same function

1130
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,339
of limiting the information that one

1131
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:03,200
system can have about another system

1132
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,359
so uh it's that

1133
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:10,200
functional analogy between a Markov

1134
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,599
blanket defined classically

1135
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:15,420
and a holographic screen defined in

1136
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,920
quantum theory

1137
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,079
that uh

1138
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,619
made it seem obvious that we could

1139
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:25,140
translate the free energy principle into

1140
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,640
a Quantum theoretic principle

1141
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,460
yes in live stream 40 we we talked a lot

1142
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,380
about this but I think that

1143
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,819
remains one of the most remarkable

1144
00:51:43,819 --> 00:51:47,579
advances inside or outside the free

1145
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:51,420
energy principle literature

1146
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,280
based upon this functional

1147
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,920
acknowledgment of boundaries

1148
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,440
and the conditions that they entail

1149
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,599
which again are the challenges that we

1150
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:02,880
want to address

1151
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,980
lest we ignore boundaries

1152
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,500
right yeah precisely I mean the free

1153
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,540
energy principle is all about

1154
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:13,460
what happens when you have a boundary

1155
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,119
the waste Heats

1156
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,400
is this

1157
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,339
the actual thermal exhaust from our CPU

1158
00:52:28,339 --> 00:52:32,119
or how can we think about the Heat

1159
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:35,720
being released

1160
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,300
topologically rather than geometrically

1161
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,300
like the location where it's released

1162
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,700
what does it mean to consider

1163
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,480
physical processes topologically that we

1164
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,760
might otherwise just use a geometric way

1165
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,359
of thinking about

1166
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,079
oh well

1167
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,420
you basically put your finger on it and

1168
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,460
that you don't you're you're not worried

1169
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,760
about the spatial difference between

1170
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,319
uh

1171
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,140
the geometric spatial difference between

1172
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,819
oh

1173
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:11,099
where one kind of information flows

1174
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:12,240
through the boundary and where another

1175
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,920
kind of information flows through the

1176
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,020
boundary

1177
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,240
uh and you can think about this in bar

1178
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,280
called blanket terms

1179
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,220
uh in the Marco blanket is just a

1180
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,599
network

1181
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:29,040
and some of the the causal arrows

1182
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,520
flowing through that blanket Network

1183
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,400
are effectively transmitting noise

1184
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,240
oh

1185
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,300
and you can you can get in the same way

1186
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,000
with respect to a holographic screen

1187
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,040
if you're doing a certain amount of

1188
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,079
information processing and this this

1189
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,180
brings up the whole issue of

1190
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:56,579
oh how how efficient is a system

1191
00:53:56,579 --> 00:53:58,619
in

1192
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:01,559
its information processing how close is

1193
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:05,460
it to the the land hour limit basically

1194
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,200
oh

1195
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,000
can it

1196
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,160
extract

1197
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,059
more more uh energy

1198
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:17,160
from some bits

1199
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:21,660
than it has to use to modify the states

1200
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,640
of other bits

1201
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,760
oh that's what this this

1202
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,700
if you will metabolic question is all

1203
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,339
about

1204
00:54:31,339 --> 00:54:35,040
uh in the case of an organism is it can

1205
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,359
I get more

1206
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:39,420
energy from some of the chemistry that I

1207
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,980
have access to

1208
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,640
then I need to use to modify

1209
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,180
the chemistry that I need to modify

1210
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,780
and if not then life stops right

1211
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:55,400
everything grinds to a halt

1212
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:05,220
now can the heat exhaust

1213
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,760
informationally be useful for another

1214
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,700
agent somehow I mean can't we recover

1215
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,059
heat in a steam engine and use it to do

1216
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:17,700
useful work not to the point of a

1217
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,500
perpetual motion machine but how can we

1218
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,619
recover exhaust and then what does the

1219
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:26,180
perpetual motion machine look like

1220
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,880
well the the environment is the system

1221
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,500
sitting over on the other side of the

1222
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,140
boundary

1223
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:37,440
that is uh absorbing

1224
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,020
whatever waste heat is generated by the

1225
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,460
system

1226
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,700
let's call it Alice that we're

1227
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,380
interested in

1228
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:51,599
so that environment of maybe

1229
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,020
and and Alice can't tell this it may be

1230
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,819
divided up into lots of different

1231
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:59,400
compartments

1232
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,819
some of which are basically sucking in

1233
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:05,819
Alice's waste heat and doing something

1234
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:08,099
with it

1235
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:11,400
so this is really a question about

1236
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,440
how is the environment structured

1237
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,680
and what uh

1238
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,819
operations does the environment execute

1239
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:26,880
with the input that it gets how does it

1240
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,020
interpret that input

1241
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,700
and what would uh let's get back to the

1242
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:40,380
this gets back to this question about uh

1243
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,599
how do we talk about multiple agents

1244
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,180
that are communicating with each other

1245
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:48,900
right instead of talking about uh

1246
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,540
and environment that we don't

1247
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,800
characterize at all

1248
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,500
how do we talk about an environment that

1249
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,319
includes some

1250
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:04,920
specified or preferred systems that are

1251
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:09,599
treated as or known to be other agents

1252
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,000
so so uh let me get back to your

1253
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,720
question about perpetual motion machine

1254
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,760
uh notice that In classical

1255
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,440
thermodynamics there's always the

1256
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,300
assumption that there's a big

1257
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,640
environment out there

1258
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,680
you know the rest of the universe or

1259
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,240
whatever the the whole environment

1260
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,700
that's not on Earth

1261
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:35,240
that is an arbitrarily large

1262
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:40,140
source of or it's not an arbitrarily

1263
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,119
large source of free energy but it's a

1264
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:44,460
large source of free energy

1265
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,339
and it's a large sink for entropy it

1266
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:49,260
kind of arbitrarily large sink for

1267
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,460
entropy

1268
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,859
so the second law of Thermodynamics says

1269
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:56,300
the entropy of this entire system

1270
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:00,660
counting uh the the whole surrounding

1271
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,599
environment doesn't decrease

1272
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,660
so it can increase

1273
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,420
and and still satisfy the second law so

1274
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,000
this gives you the the classical you

1275
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,760
know 19th century heat death of the

1276
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,920
universe idea

1277
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:22,260
and so you're you're a proposed machine

1278
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,940
is

1279
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,200
sitting somewhere embedded in this

1280
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,700
gigantic environment

1281
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,940
that can provide some finite amount of

1282
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,339
free energy but can exhaust effectively

1283
00:58:35,339 --> 00:58:39,540
an arbitrary amount of entropy

1284
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:43,559
so any any machine has to dissipate

1285
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:47,880
entropy as it runs to to fill up this

1286
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,200
kind of arbitrary

1287
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,760
sync of entropy that's the classical

1288
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,400
rest of the universe now compare that to

1289
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,440
the picture in quantum theory

1290
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,480
right the picture in quantum theory is

1291
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,520
the universe by definition is an

1292
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,500
isolated system

1293
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,220
so it's total information content

1294
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,980
doesn't change

1295
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,280
right it's evolving unitarily

1296
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,240
unitary operations preserve information

1297
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,200
so they're just moving information

1298
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,859
around

1299
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:26,520
so from any uh

1300
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,260
from the point of view of any local

1301
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,599
system

1302
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:32,579
the local systems getting information

1303
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:35,220
from its environment so it sees its

1304
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,500
environment losing information so

1305
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,400
gaining entropy

1306
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,579
what this tells us is that that entropy

1307
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:48,119
is in fact not a

1308
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,140
um

1309
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:53,220
a globally definable quantity entropy is

1310
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,559
always defined relative to some Observer

1311
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:59,900
some division some boundary

1312
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:03,000
and this is this is another

1313
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,180
kind of big change in the last few

1314
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,400
decades and has led to

1315
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,220
for example in Tropic definitions of

1316
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,119
time

1317
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:14,099
now my local

1318
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:17,220
external time Arrow

1319
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:20,839
is whatever Direction I see entropy

1320
01:00:20,839 --> 01:00:24,259
increasing the most

1321
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,079
so again I would refer to people like

1322
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:32,819
Rovelli

1323
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:36,240
uh and Max Tegmark who developed many of

1324
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,660
these ideas

1325
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,359
awesome

1326
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:43,920
all right

1327
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,460
thank you Chris and under

1328
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,380
looking forward to seeing everyone's

1329
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:52,440
questions submitted and their

1330
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,440
preparation and participation and

1331
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,900
measurements in the discussion section

1332
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,440
so thank you until next time all right

1333
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,079
thanks again Daniel uh thank you under

1334
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,780
uh we'll see you later bye
