00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,462
Hello and welcome everyone.

2
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:11,230
It's July 13, 2023.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:17,818
We're here in physics as information processing with the third lecture by Chris Fields.

4
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:31,474
So please check out the course website, Coda Document, where you can submit questions, check out the recordings and descriptions of all sessions, and register if you want to participate in one of the discussion sections.

5
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:34,600
So thank you again, Chris, to you.

6
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:44,330
Thank you and welcome to Physics as Information Processing, session Three, which is about quantum reference frames.

7
00:00:45,470 --> 00:01:07,490
So in this course, we've talked about quantum information theory, which we characterized as a general theory that describes the exchange of information, exchange of finite information between two finite agents that are separated by some boundary.

8
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:17,330
And we emphasize that this is a topological theory, not a geometric theory, so it makes no assumptions about an embedding spacetime.

9
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:50,830
And last time we showed how to characterize this boundary of script B as an array of N, some finite N quantum bits or qubits, and how to characterize the interaction of the agents A and B with the boundary as an alternating cycle of preparing and measuring the qubits in this array.

10
00:01:51,410 --> 00:02:00,130
And we showed that their interaction could be represented as a sum of operators, each of which act on just one of the qubits.

11
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:16,038
And we also talked about the need for each of the agents A and B to choose a reference frame for their interaction with the qubits that defined which way was up.

12
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:42,590
So what the orientations of the qubits meant and emphasized that the two observers A and B could choose different reference frames, so different ways of measuring and preparing their qubits that use different meanings for the idea of up for each qubit.

13
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:59,490
And we ended the last session with a pointer forward toward the quantum formulation of the free energy principle, which can be stated as the claim that interacting systems behave in a way that aligns their reference frames.

14
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:19,014
And pointed out at that time that what this means is that the two agents A and B approach entanglement asymptotically, and that therefore the FEP is a classical limit of the principle of unitarity, which is the core principle of quantum theory.

15
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:22,540
So we'll see in this session why this is true.

16
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:41,330
So what we'll talk about today is what reference frames are in general, how they make observations and actions meaningful, so how they give physics a semantics, and then we'll talk about the free energy principle.

17
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,650
So what is a reference frame?

18
00:03:46,550 --> 00:04:01,160
The idea that physics involves reference frames goes back at least to Galileo, but was probably familiar well before that, just not formalized in the way that Galileo formalized it.

19
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:07,050
So the key idea can be thought of in terms of motion.

20
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:19,738
And you're all familiar, for example, with riding a bicycle or driving a car and seeing the world as if it's passing by you at some velocity, with some velocity.

21
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:24,830
And of course, with respect to the world you're passing by it with some velocity.

22
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:40,802
And this idea that velocity is not absolute but that's relative to some observer who measures it in some reference frame is the foundation for theories of relativity.

23
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:58,410
So Galileo developed his theory of relativity which basically was just a way of converting from classical velocities measured by one observer to classical velocities measured by another observer that was moving with respect to the first one.

24
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:17,490
And this provided the foundation for Einstein's theories of relativity which modified Galileo's by adding the concept that the observers have to exchange information and can only exchange it at the speed of light which is finite.

25
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,660
So this idea in physics has a long history.

26
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:32,040
Of course, the core idea is that measurements are always with respect to something or other.

27
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,870
And the something or other is a reference frame and different agents can choose different reference frames.

28
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,494
And this idea is very old.

29
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:50,170
Here we have a picture of Anubis choosing a feather as the reference frame with which to measure the heart of the pharaoh.

30
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,906
So this goes back to well before the common era.

31
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,950
This is about 2000 BCE.

32
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:27,750
So this is a very old idea that's been elaborated over the centuries as science has developed and in the 90s a fairly big change in how this idea was thought about occurred. In classical physics reference frames were always thought of as mathematical abstractions and an observer and a reference frame were more or less identified by Galileo...

33
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:43,210
...and that identification is carried forward into Einstein who thinks about observers, for example, sitting on photons and observers in spaceships and observers riding on railroad trains and this sort of thing...

34
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,720
...and always that just means, think of a reference frame that's doing something or other.

35
00:06:49,570 --> 00:07:13,350
So a reference frame in classical physics is essentially just a coordinate system and these abstract coordinate systems can be employed in thought experiments and so they are a way to illustrate classical intuitions about motion.

36
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:27,002
And in the 90s, as quantum information theory developed it was realized that a reference frame actually consists of a physical object.

37
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:34,250
I mean, even in the picture from the Egyptian tomb the reference frame is a physical feather.

38
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:42,554
And that means that the reference frame itself is described by quantum theory.

39
00:07:42,602 --> 00:07:44,560
It's some quantum system.

40
00:07:45,810 --> 00:08:06,950
And if you think about reference frames that are familiar for example, meter sticks for measuring distance or clocks for measuring time or gyroscopes or batteries or even the Earth's gravitational fields which typically defines up for us; those are all physical objects that can be described by quantum theory.

41
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:20,490
Well, this was an important insight because it led to the realization that reference frames as quantum systems are unique.

42
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,200
And uniqueness in quantum theory is very strong.

43
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:34,080
There's the no-cloning theorem which states that you can't reproduce, exactly reproduce, any unknown quantum state.

44
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:43,074
And that applies to reference frames because they encode what Bartlett et al.

45
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:53,270
...in that paper called nonfungible information which just means information that can't be completely represented in any finite bit string.

46
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,520
So unless you know the state of a reference frame, you can't clone it.

47
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:15,946
Since these reference frames encode more than any bit string's worth of information in their quantum phases, they're unique and their states are unknown.

48
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:27,726
And the consequence of this is that if Alice wants Bob to use her reference frame to make a measurement, she can't just send him a description.

49
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:31,410
She has to actually send the reference frame.

50
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:51,350
And this has an important consequence for physics because it makes all replicate measurements approximate because observers obviously aren't using exactly the same physical objects as their reference frames.

51
00:09:51,790 --> 00:10:05,630
But there's a deeper implication of this, which is that Alice's ultimate rock bottom reference frame is actually implemented by her body, by her brain.

52
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:18,426
And using any external reference frame requires having this internal reference frame that makes the external reference frame meaningful and usable.

53
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:23,902
So, for example, this thing is a piece of a meter stick, a third of a meter stick.

54
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:30,790
But for me to use it to make measurements, I have to actually have some concept of distance.

55
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,400
And that concept of distance is implemented by my nervous system.

56
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,990
And that implementation is my reference frame for length.

57
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:48,598
And it's what gives meaning to any external measurement of length.

58
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:59,600
It's what makes my measurements of length actionable by me using my effectors or action capabilities, whatever they are.

59
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:07,730
So my internal reference frames are what make information I get from the world actionable.

60
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:15,694
And in Bateson's sense of differences that make a difference, actionability is the core of semantics.

61
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:19,720
Something is meaningful if I can do something about it.

62
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:33,990
So this idea that we all contain embodied reference frames gives physics a semantics by giving observers a semantics.

63
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,580
And this is new.

64
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:46,030
This is an idea that never really appeared in physics before that measurements automatically had to have some kind of semantics.

65
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,550
But reference frames give semantics to measurements.

66
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,410
So here's an example of an embodied reference frame.

67
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,266
This is the reference frame that bacteria use for chemotaxis, i.

68
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:03,522
e,

69
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:13,830
...to move toward molecules in the environment that they like, like sugars and to move away from molecules that they don't like, like acids.

70
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,142
And it's been worked out in great detail over decades of experimental work.

71
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,190
And this is a rough schematic.

72
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,130
The reference frame has three parts.

73
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:33,530
There's the measurement part, which is conveniently located in the front of the bacterium.

74
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,950
And it consists of a bunch of receptors that probe the environment.

75
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:44,346
And they can bind molecules, which are called ligands, out in the environment.

76
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:50,250
And when they bind them, they send a signal into the back of the bacterium.

77
00:12:50,330 --> 00:13:03,830
And it turns out that there's a little miniature reference frame attached directly to these ligands which is this R and B system which control the ligands--not the ligands--the receptor sensitivity.

78
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:20,170
Then the back of the reference frame is the action component and it consists of a set of molecules that control a motor--a molecular motor--that drives the flagella on the bacteria.

79
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:27,390
And the flagellum allows it to swim forwards or turn in some other direction.

80
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:36,640
And depending on how it spins, the creature either goes in the direction of something it likes or it stops and turns around.

81
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:52,760
And the stuff in the middle is a little molecular feedback loop that represents the amount of ligand in the environment that the bacterium expects to see.

82
00:13:53,130 --> 00:14:02,410
So this is the middle of the reference frame and it defines the default value for what the bacterium is observing in its environment.

83
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:19,760
And if you're thinking in terms of the free energy principle or Bayesian inference, then you'll immediately see the concentration of this molecule is encoding a prior probability, the bacterium's prior probability for what its environment is like.

84
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:31,300
And the zero point, the default value of that encoding, is the ligand concentration in which the bacterium does nothing.

85
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:50,710
So a QRF in general can be characterized as an expected value, which is here the concentration of this molecule pY phosphorylated plus a bunch of computation, which is all the rest of the things in this diagram.

86
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,130
So this is a very simple QRF that's embodied by a bacteria.

87
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:08,670
Here's a more complicated QRF that's embodied by eukaryotic cells, or more complicated cells like our cells.

88
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:17,070
And this is the reference frame that makes decisions about whether cells are going to divide.

89
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:32,790
So on the top you see the cell's membrane, and there are all sorts of receptors sticking out of it that detect hormones and neurotransmitters and growth factors and this, that, and the other thing, many of which are produced by other cells.

90
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:55,710
And those receptors communicate via a lot of chemistry with the nucleus, which is contained in another membrane and so serves as, in a sense, the outside upon which the reference frame is acting.

91
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:03,770
And what this reference frame does is control the transcription of large numbers of molecules from DNA.

92
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,586
So it basically controls what proteins the cell is making.

93
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:14,530
And those proteins end up doing something like restructuring the cytoplasm and actually driving cell division.

94
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:27,030
And the stuff in the middle of this reference frame, which I've labeled the integrative center, are three molecules called RAF, mech and ERC.

95
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:33,450
And they're connected by positive bi-directional feedback loops.

96
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:44,300
And they basically negotiate the default value of the environment at which the cell does nothing.

97
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:54,970
So they're the middle of the reference frame that represents the cell's expectation values about what's going on in its environment.

98
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,754
So you can imagine now what reference frames encoded by our nervous system look like.

99
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:15,350
They're extremely complicated and exist at multiple scales, from the scale of molecules in cells to the scale of large scale connections between parts of our brains.

100
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,960
So how do we represent all this stuff?

101
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:27,020
There are many ways to do this, but this is a particularly simple way.

102
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:48,370
It assumes that whatever's in the middle, which is here called C prime, is the most general thing that the inputs can give information to and the most general thing that can give information to the outputs.

103
00:17:49,030 --> 00:18:06,070
And most general here has a category-theoretic definition so it can be stated in a way that's equivalent across many different specific mathematical forms.

104
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:15,158
But if you're familiar with neural networks, this will look to you a lot like the skeleton of a variational autoencoder.

105
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:17,660
And that's basically what it is.

106
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:41,620
And I don't want to deal with this formalism except to say that it exists and is very convenient, except to say that we can attach this kind of formal diagram as a representation of a QRF to our representation of the boundary between two interacting agents.

107
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:54,070
And we can use these formal structures to drive the measurement operators that actually implement physical changes on this boundary.

108
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:06,646
And I'll represent this whole business with just a triangle labeled Q for some QRF that's attached to the boundary.

109
00:19:06,838 --> 00:19:20,830
And we can use this simple notation then to investigate what sorts of structures one gets when one starts to think about systems as implementing specific QRFs.

110
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:29,970
And here's the structure of the minimal system that we can really think of as an interesting observer.

111
00:19:30,870 --> 00:20:01,078
And this is a system that has some QRF that I've called E that looks at its environment, the part of its environment that it can actually observe and act on, and it defines a sector of the boundary which mathematically is just the image of this QRF-E that the system can manipulate.

112
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:08,560
So this is the part of the environment or the part of the boundary that the system actually sees and can do something about.

113
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:27,380
And for this observer to be interesting, it needs to be able to detect the difference between what it sees now and what it saw just then so that it can decide whether to take some action or other.

114
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:36,802
So it needs a memory and that requires another QRF that has some allocated piece of the boundary. Recall...

115
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:44,570
...the boundary is where classical information gets written in this purely quantum theoretic formalism.

116
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,620
So it needs a memory sector that that QRF can act on.

117
00:20:51,470 --> 00:21:06,000
And then in order to do this computation and specifically in order to write information to the boundary--in order to actually flip bits on the boundary--it needs free energy.

118
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:19,890
So the rest of its boundary gets devoted to extracting free energy from the environment and exhausting free energy, waste heat, in other words, into the environment.

119
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:24,600
And so it has this nice little thermodynamic cycle that drives everything else.

120
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:44,800
And finally, in order to tell now from just a second ago the information in memory, it needs a clock that marks the information in memory as not current, so as past information.

121
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:58,900
And if it can store multiple memory records, it needs to be able to count and say this piece of remembered information is actually more recent than that piece over there.

122
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:07,490
So it has to implement a little internal clock, and that clock is its internal time QRF.

123
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,058
And we've seen that QRFs act on boundaries.

124
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:15,320
This clock acts on a boundary, but it doesn't act on B.

125
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:33,050
It acts on an internal boundary that's essentially the boundary between it the clock and the points at the ends of these QRFs that actually encode information that's either read from the environment or written to the environment.

126
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:52,130
So already this minimal observer has a little bit of hierarchical structure, which is that its clock has to, in some sense, be higher up in the hierarchy than the parts, the QRFs that interact directly with the environment.

127
00:22:53,590 --> 00:23:04,950
So if you have a structure like this, you face a metabolic trade off for a fixed amount of energy that you can extract from the environment.

128
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:13,740
You can allocate it either into learning more about the environment or remembering more about what you learned before.

129
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:22,170
So any system has to make this decision about how they're going to use energy.

130
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,758
Are they going to devote it to learning more or remembering more.

131
00:23:25,924 --> 00:23:29,050
And your laptop makes that decision.

132
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,390
Memory is cheap for your laptop.

133
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,770
Your brain makes that decision.

134
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,390
Memory is much more expensive for your brain.

135
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,102
And all cells have to make that decision.

136
00:23:39,246 --> 00:23:46,142
And the universal solution to this trade off is coarse graining memory...

137
00:23:46,286 --> 00:23:46,882
...i.e.,

138
00:23:46,936 --> 00:23:50,878
...remembering things in less detail than you saw them in the beginning.

139
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,710
Ander, you have a comment?

140
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,278
Yes.

141
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:57,074
I wanted to ask a question now before it gets too late.

142
00:23:57,122 --> 00:24:12,630
So two or three slides ago, when we were looking at the diagram of the co-cone diagrams, I was wondering if the classifiers identified with measurement and preparation...

143
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:26,602
...those correspond to sensory and action degrees of freedom in the earlier picture with the bacteria and the classifier in the middle in that picture, would it correspond to the default chemical concentration?

144
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:28,480
That yes, exactly.

145
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,586
Okay, perfect.

146
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:31,380
Yeah.

147
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,770
That crossing point in the middle is specifically where the default is encoded.

148
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,360
Thank you for pointing that out.

149
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:51,020
Okay, so let's follow the consequences of this metabolic issue.

150
00:24:53,150 --> 00:25:08,586
If you have a system that's a little bit smarter than our minimal system that can actually detect and measure the states of objects, it has to do even more work because it has to encode even more QRFs.

151
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:14,686
So think of measuring the state of some object like a volt meter in a laboratory.

152
00:25:14,878 --> 00:25:22,710
If I tell you to go into the lab and tell me what the voltmeter is reading, then the first thing you have to do is find the voltmeter.

153
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:32,170
And your process of finding the voltmeter is independent of your process of reading what it's actually saying on its dial.

154
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:45,840
So in order to measure the state of an object, you have to have two QRFs one that lets you find the object, and then the other that lets you measure the state of interest of the object.

155
00:25:46,370 --> 00:26:02,820
And we call these the R sector for reference that lets you find the object and the P sector for pointer because old instruments used to have pointers on dials that read analog numbers.

156
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:36,898
But what thinking about object identification tells you is that every object that you can identify leads to having to sector both the informative part of your boundary and the memory part of your boundary into two new sectors one to store information about object identification and one to store information about the states of those objects.

157
00:26:37,074 --> 00:26:40,310
So this requires much more metabolism.

158
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,234
And again, the solution is coarse grained.

159
00:26:45,362 --> 00:26:50,970
Typically, what we coarse grain is our memory of the object that we've identified.

160
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,250
So what does this do to systems?

161
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:08,240
Because making measurements costs energy and recording memories costs energy...

162
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:15,586
...we have to make decisions about what QRFs to use at what time.

163
00:27:15,688 --> 00:27:25,250
Given our finite energy budgets, we can't look at the world with all of our measurement capabilities at the same time because it's too expensive.

164
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:55,546
And now we see the effect of a theorem in quantum information theory which is that if two QRFs can't be deployed simultaneously for whatever reason that corresponds to them not commuting as operators and if they don't commute as operators, they have to be implemented by compartments that are separable.

165
00:27:55,658 --> 00:27:58,990
So compartments that only communicate classically.

166
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:22,098
The consequence of this theorem is that as soon as one has too many sensory and motor capabilities to run all at the same time, given your energy budget you end up being compartmentalized into compartments that only communicate classically.

167
00:28:22,194 --> 00:28:38,250
So you end up looking like this diagram where there are a bunch of components that do sensory motor loops or memory, one or the other and they can only communicate classically.

168
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:51,280
And they're controlled by some sort of attention system that selects which ones to activate depending on the amount of free energy that's available.

169
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:58,500
And clearly, this clock function becomes part of this control system.

170
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:25,980
So, the physics alone of any system that's acting as, that executes a fairly complicated interaction with its environment gives us this hierarchical compartmentalized structure without having to add any biological or cognitive science type assumptions at all.

171
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,300
So we can go in three directions from this.

172
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,150
We can go deeper into the biology which we're going to do in October.

173
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:47,220
We can go deeper into the physics which we're going to do in August and September and we can go deeper into this issue of alignment which is what we're going to do today.

174
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,430
So there are four possibilities.

175
00:29:50,590 --> 00:30:00,870
If you think about two agents that have QRFs that are interacting across this boundary and the first one is trivial.

176
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:14,934
If the B agent, the agent on the right side, doesn't actually employ any QRFs if it just interacts with the boundary thermally, then there is no alignment.

177
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:20,380
You're in a trivial situation where A can measure something about B, but not in return.

178
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:39,860
If the B agent deploys a QRF that's much broader in scope than the A agent what we show here in panel B, then the A agent can learn something about the B agent but misses most of what the B agent is doing.

179
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:50,962
In panel C, we have agents with QRFs of the same size on the boundary, but they're not lined up correctly.

180
00:30:51,026 --> 00:30:54,440
So each one misses part of what the other is doing.

181
00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:03,162
And finally, indeed, we have the optimal situation where they have QRFs of the same size and they're actually lined up.

182
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:08,890
So each sees what the other is doing, at least on this sector of the boundary.

183
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:21,370
And since the agents have to allocate some of the boundary to free energy supply and can't look at that part, then they can't tell what's happening across their entire boundaries.

184
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:27,730
They can only tell what's happening in this sector where they can actually deploy a QRF.

185
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:39,160
But let's now look at this interesting situation, situation D, where the QRFs are aligned between A and B.

186
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,600
As I said, that's the optimal channel for A and B.

187
00:31:45,770 --> 00:32:15,506
And if we think about this, we can write the variational free energy or the uncertainty or the prediction error for A for the QRF X as the action that it sees, i.e., B's action, the difference between that and what it expects B to do.

188
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:18,930
So what it can predict about B's action.

189
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:51,920
And this is just the notion of free energy from the free energy principle, except translated into this situation where we have two QRFs and A can measure what B has done, but it can also use its QRF to predict, because it's predicting the very state that it's going to observe next of the same sector that B is using.

190
00:32:53,410 --> 00:33:11,140
Now, if we look at this diagram, we can see easily that the way to minimize the variational free energy and therefore maximize predictive capability is for these two QRFs to actually be the same.

191
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:28,700
So if A is doing the same thing to the boundary that B is, A can predict B's next action perfectly because B is going to do whatever A is doing.

192
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:49,070
So what the free energy principle tells us in this case is that A and B, as they minimize their variational free energies, will approach having identical QRFs.

193
00:33:50,210 --> 00:34:00,210
Well, again, we have a theorem that tells us that if these QRFs are shared, A and B are not separable but entangled.

194
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:07,190
And this is also fairly easy to see because it depends on this notion of nonfungibility.

195
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:15,480
If XA and XB both encode nonfungible information, which is quantum systems, they do...

196
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:26,540
..their states aren't clonable, so they can't be copies of each other because one can't clone an unknown system.

197
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:32,430
So they can only be identical if they're actually identical systems.

198
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:44,850
This is exactly the same point made earlier about Alice having to actually send her QRF to Bob if she wants Bob to use her QRF.

199
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:54,050
So minimizing VFE for quantum systems is becoming entangled.

200
00:34:55,050 --> 00:35:03,538
So the classical free energy principle, which tells us to minimize VFE actually drives quantum systems toward entanglement.

201
00:35:03,714 --> 00:35:15,450
And that's why it's a special case of the principle of unitarity which just says that any isolated joint system is going to asymptotically approach entanglement.

202
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:27,360
So this raises an obvious question, which is why all of us aren't entangled with our environments all the time and entangled with each other?

203
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:35,170
And the answer is that entanglement is really hard for complex systems.

204
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:44,500
And this illustrates the sense in which the FEP is moving systems in two different directions at once.

205
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:54,790
The FEP is driving systems to maintain their separability but it's also driving systems toward entanglement.

206
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:03,690
And as the system becomes more and more complex the difference between those two outcomes becomes larger and larger.

207
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:17,390
So recall from last time that the condition for separability is that the two systems have dimensions that are much larger than the dimension of their boundary.

208
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:26,770
And this is the condition that allows them to have internal states, to have them have states that aren't located on their boundaries.

209
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:33,540
And clearly, to formulate the free energy principle you have to have internal states.

210
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:45,510
So if you do a complex QRF that's in a lot of computation then you need a lot of internal degrees of freedom to implement that computation.

211
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,362
So you need a lot of internal state.

212
00:36:48,496 --> 00:36:51,130
So you have to have large dimensions.

213
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:56,090
So complexity favors separability.

214
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:01,710
As a system becomes more complex, it has to have more internal states.

215
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,720
So it has to be, in a sense, more separable from whatever it's interacting with.

216
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,110
Now, think about this classically.

217
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:35,350
If you have a complex system that's doing a lot of computation then it requires a lot of free energy and it has to dissipate a lot of entropy in the form of heat, typically, but something, some form of energy transfer that its environment is going to see as noise, as not informative.

218
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:43,340
So a complex system is working very hard to predict its environment's next state.

219
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:49,286
But by working very hard it's dumping a lot of entropy into its environment.

220
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:56,730
And putting in that extra entropy makes the environment's behavior even harder to predict.

221
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:06,690
So the more you work at predicting what the environment is going to do the more you yourself make the environment's behavior less predictable.

222
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:12,670
And this is the paradox of the FEP, which is not really a paradox.

223
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,980
It's just what the physics does.

224
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:45,310
So we can think of the FEP by driving systems to increase their distinctness from their environments or to self evidence, as Karl Friston calls it, as driving this increased complexity that both makes predictions better and makes predictions harder by transferring entropy into the environment.

225
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:57,086
So what this tells us is that the FEP by itself will drive the development of systems with larger and larger complexity.

226
00:38:57,278 --> 00:39:05,830
And this clearly has enormous implications for evolutionary theory which we'll talk about in October.

227
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,554
But I want to emphasize here that this is just the physics.

228
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:17,510
It's just what the FEP does when it's forced to maintain a boundary.

229
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:31,710
And before stopping here, I want to consider one aspect of this in particular, which is language.

230
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:42,800
For example, human language, but any kind of language connecting any systems that are communicating with QRFs that are fairly close.

231
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:49,650
And language is a complex QRF that we basically share.

232
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:57,670
Otherwise, things like this interaction would be impossible, but we also remain distinct systems.

233
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,862
So the question arises, how do we manage to do this?

234
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:09,530
How do we manage to largely share a QRF while escaping, becoming entangled?

235
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:24,458
And this is a question that's largely been ignored in physics because physicists have tended to ignore language and just assume that observers can communicate classically.

236
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:40,180
So, for example, in talking about a Bell/PR experiment, which is a canonical experiment for measuring entanglement, the observers have to be able to share their results, or they can't observe entanglement, right?

237
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:54,898
The observed result is a bunch of observational statistics that violate Bell's inequality, and those statistics can only be computed given the results that both of the observers obtain.

238
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:59,290
So the observers have to share language to encode these results.

239
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,410
So how come the observers aren't entangled?

240
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,850
How come they are still separable?

241
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:16,026
What we end up appealing to is some sort of common cause in the past to explain why they share a language.

242
00:41:16,218 --> 00:41:21,760
They both learned it from their culture, so their culture is some sort of common cause.

243
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:26,610
But all such assumptions are fine tuning assumptions.

244
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:44,120
So they all have basically the status of the value of something like the fine structure constant, without which we wouldn't have atoms and so we wouldn't have us.

245
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:53,210
This value has to be within very small limits of the value we actually observe.

246
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,206
And that's a case of fine tuning.

247
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:01,950
The universe seems fine tuned in a way that allows us to exist.

248
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:08,560
And if it wasn't fine tuned in that way, we wouldn't exist, and so we wouldn't observe anything.

249
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:12,218
But fine tuning assumptions are a problem.

250
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:15,220
They're a pointer to something we don't understand.

251
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:26,070
And so I just want to leave you with the point that we have to be very careful when talking about interacting observers.

252
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:49,740
So in talking about two components of some system that jointly interact with some environment but also communicate classically, and if you think back a few slides, that's exactly the structure that we've shown that the physics forces any complicated system to have.

253
00:42:50,610 --> 00:43:07,970
So next time, what we're going to focus on is this very question of how we describe observers that are both interacting with the quantum system and communicating classically in some language.

254
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,970
So that session will be in August.

255
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:24,680
At the end of this month, there's a discussion of this session with Ander, and I encourage you all to use the interactive Q and A to ask questions.

256
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:30,620
You've been asking very good questions that I hope I've been managing to answer.

257
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,418
So thank you very much.

258
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:34,422
And Daniel.

259
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,500
Over to you.

260
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:37,562
Cool.

261
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:37,882
Well.

262
00:43:37,936 --> 00:43:50,720
We have a few minutes for some questions maybe and or if you want to bring up any questions first, then go for it.

263
00:43:53,330 --> 00:44:02,718
I was curious if you could say any words on the slide where you had all the possible alignments of QRFs and what you meant more by interacting thermally.

264
00:44:02,814 --> 00:44:09,350
So when you have a trivial agent on one side, what exactly does it mean to say that you're interacting thermally?

265
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:37,830
If you think about a system that is only interacting thermally with its environment, you end up thinking classically about, for example, an ideal gas that's in some sort of container and some of the molecules are very near the surface and their motions depend on the motions of all the other molecules that are inside.

266
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:54,040
So there's a set of internal states that interact randomly with the external states that are near the boundary and so those external states interact randomly with the boundary.

267
00:44:54,700 --> 00:45:08,750
But notice in thinking in this way, you've imposed a spacetime embedding, so you've actually used space as a way of separating the internal states from the boundary states.

268
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:29,700
And a system that if you drop this assumption of a spatial boundary, then a system that's only interacting thermally with its environment is going to look like a system that doesn't have any real internal states.

269
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,030
It's going to look like a system that just has boundary states.

270
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,200
And so a pure thermal interaction is going to start to look like entanglement.

271
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:47,384
So we're actually only really interested in systems that aren't interacting only purely thermally with their environments.

272
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:56,860
We're interested in systems that have enough internal structure that they're using that thermal energy to do something internally.

273
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:17,510
So to give their internal dynamics some particular shape, so that their internal dynamics is actually circling around some well-defined attractor that requires some energy to maintain itself.

274
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,244
Yeah, I'm continuing with that question.

275
00:46:22,442 --> 00:46:39,420
I saw in the paper free energy principle for Quantum Systems that if you're in that situation when both keras are nontrivial, but perhaps B's is larger than A's, A's perceives non-local hidden variables.

276
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:48,220
So I wonder if there is a way to relate those by taking a limit of making A small and recover the thermal interaction.

277
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:55,264
Presumably if you let A become small, you should recover that thermal interaction, so to speak.

278
00:46:55,302 --> 00:46:55,890
Right?

279
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,984
Yeah, that's a very interesting comment actually.

280
00:47:00,102 --> 00:47:18,016
So if you're a system and all of your environments variables are effectively hidden to you, then you can't do any information processing because you don't have any access to any of your system, your environments' variables.

281
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:21,172
So yeah, your interaction can only be thermal.

282
00:47:21,236 --> 00:47:22,490
I think that's correct.

283
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,450
Thank you.

284
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:37,310
Since we're in this, in this topic and we don't have to context switch in that way.

285
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,016
On the other hand, you have noise, right?

286
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:45,250
In one of those other situations, I can't recall which one.

287
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,448
I guess in the reversed one, right.

288
00:47:48,614 --> 00:47:58,880
When A's QRF is larger than that of B, so it encompasses more of the boundary degrees of freedom, those that are not overlapping A perceives as noises.

289
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,604
That's correct.

290
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:00,230
Right?

291
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:01,780
Yeah.

292
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:09,412
A will be looking at B's thermal sector, B's free energy sector.

293
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:10,200
Right.

294
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:23,340
So A may be interpreting, in a sense, what it's doing as informative, and A may even be seeing what B is doing as informative.

295
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:43,890
So noise for B may be signal for A, depending on how a's QRF is structured, but A is seeing more information than B is trying to send it.

296
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:50,390
So it's essentially the reverse of the hidden variable case.

297
00:48:51,400 --> 00:49:02,410
There are variables in the other system that aren't telling you anything about what the other system is actually doing.

298
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:15,122
That's very interesting in terms of reading too much or too little between the lines, connecting too many dots or connecting not enough dots.

299
00:49:15,266 --> 00:49:25,098
But these challenges where noise for one quantum cognitive agent might be signal for another and vice versa, those are the challenges that we want to address...

300
00:49:25,184 --> 00:49:37,950
...because to have a physics that doesn't recognize those situations is kind of taking the view from nowhere or not really addressing the complexity of a cognitive engagement.

301
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:47,330
Yeah, it's describing interactions between, effectively, systems that don't share the same language.

302
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:53,300
I have a question about the free energy principle here.

303
00:49:54,630 --> 00:50:02,790
Only in the last several years has the quantum free energy principle relationship come into light.

304
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:11,130
So maybe could you just share a little bit about what incremental or quantum advances enabled that to happen?

305
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:30,400
Or what degrees of freedom were pre-existing or added to enable work arising from perception and action in neural systems to also so naturally enter this context with the quantum information?

306
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:47,620
Well, I think, at least from a historical point of view, that connection was made based on the analogy between a Markov blanket and a Holographic screen.

307
00:50:48,570 --> 00:51:01,420
So these are structures developed in different parts of physics that essentially serve the same function of limiting the information that one system can have about another system.

308
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:26,930
So it's that functional analogy between a Markov blanket defined classically and a Holographic screen defined in quantum theory that made it seem obvious that we could translate the free energy principle into a quantum theoretic principle.

309
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:35,954
Yes.

310
00:51:36,072 --> 00:52:04,650
In live stream 40, we talked a lot about this, but I think that remains one of the most remarkable advances inside or outside the free energy principle literature based upon this functional acknowledgment of boundaries and the conditions that they entail, which, again, are the challenges that we want to address lest we ignore boundaries.

311
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:05,642
Right

312
00:52:05,776 --> 00:52:06,774
Yeah, precisely.

313
00:52:06,822 --> 00:52:11,630
I mean, the free energy principle is all about what happens when you have a boundary.

314
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,230
The waste heat.

315
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:28,210
Is this the actual thermal exhaust from our CPU?

316
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:42,338
Or how can we think about the heat being released topologically rather than geometrically, like the location where it's released?

317
00:52:42,434 --> 00:52:51,740
What does it mean to consider physical processes topologically that we might otherwise just use a geometric way of thinking about?

318
00:52:53,870 --> 00:53:14,530
Well, you basically put your finger on it and that you're not worried about the spatial difference between the geometric spatial difference between where one kind of information flows through the boundary and where another kind of information flows through the boundary.

319
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:19,460
And you can think about this in Markov blanket terms.

320
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,730
And the Markov blanket is just a network.

321
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:35,830
And some of the causal arrows flowing through that blanket network are effectively transmitting noise.

322
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:48,374
And you can think in the same way with respect to a holographic screen if you're doing a certain amount of information processing.

323
00:53:48,422 --> 00:54:00,522
And this brings up the whole issue of how efficient is a system in its information processing?

324
00:54:00,586 --> 00:54:03,630
How close is it to the Landauder limit,

325
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:04,340
basically.

326
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:22,950
Can it extract more energy from some bits than it has to use to modify the states of other bits?

327
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:30,060
That's what this, if you will, metabolic question is all about.

328
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:47,150
In the case of an organism, is it, can I get more energy from some of the chemistry that I have access to than I need to use to modify the chemistry that I need to modify?

329
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:51,622
And if not, then life stops.

330
00:54:51,786 --> 00:54:53,650
Everything grinds to a halt.

331
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:10,066
Now, can the heat exhaust informationally be useful for another agent somehow?

332
00:55:10,178 --> 00:55:16,234
I mean, can't we recover heat in a steam engine and use it to do useful work?

333
00:55:16,432 --> 00:55:21,334
Not to the point of a perpetual motion machine, but how can we recover exhaust?

334
00:55:21,462 --> 00:55:24,640
And then what does the perpetual motion machine look like?

335
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:40,420
Well, the environment is the system sitting over on the other side of the boundary that is absorbing whatever waste heat is generated by the system.

336
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,620
Let's call it Alice that we're interested in.

337
00:55:46,310 --> 00:56:06,780
So that environment may be Alice, and Alice can't tell this, but it may be divided up into lots of different compartments, some of which are basically sucking in Alice's waste heat and doing something with it.

338
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:26,162
So this is really a question about how is the environment structured and what operations does the environment execute with the input that it gets?

339
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,450
How does it interpret that input?

340
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,430
And what would.

341
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:53,150
This gets back to this question about how do we talk about multiple agents that are communicating with each other instead of talking about an environment that we don't characterize at all?

342
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:07,730
How do we talk about an environment that includes some specified or preferred systems that are treated as or known to be other agents?

343
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,800
Let me get back to your question about perpetual motion machine.

344
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:28,580
Notice that in classical thermodynamics there's always the assumption that there's a big environment out there the rest of the universe or whatever, the whole environment that's not on Earth.

345
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:43,790
That is an arbitrarily large source of, or it's not an arbitrarily large source of free energy, but it's a large source of free energy.

346
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,216
And it's a large sink for entropy, a kind of arbitrarily large sink for entropy.

347
00:57:50,408 --> 00:58:09,028
So the second law of thermodynamics says the entropy of this entire system counting the whole surrounding environment doesn't decrease, so it can increase and still satisfy the second law.

348
00:58:09,114 --> 00:58:15,750
So this gives you the classical 19th century heat death of the Universe idea.

349
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:37,820
And so your proposed machine is sitting somewhere embedded in this gigantic environment that can provide some finite amount of free energy but can exhaust effectively an arbitrary amount of entropy.

350
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:55,116
So any machine has to dissipate entropy as it runs to fill up this kind of arbitrary sink of entropy that's the classical rest of the Universe.

351
00:58:55,228 --> 00:58:58,180
Now, compare that to the picture in quantum theory.

352
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:03,670
The picture in quantum theory is the universe, by definition, is an isolated system.

353
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:11,480
So its total information content doesn't change, right?

354
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:12,564
It's evolving...

355
00:59:12,612 --> 00:59:20,170
...unitarily, unitary operations preserve information, so they're just moving information around.

356
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:38,800
So from the point of view of any local system, the local system is getting information from its environment, so it sees its environment losing information, so gaining entropy.

357
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:52,400
What this tells us is that entropy is, in fact, not a globally definable quantity.

358
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,260
Entropy is always defined relative to some observer, some division, some boundary.

359
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:11,850
1: And this is another kind of big change in the last few decades and has led to, for example, entropic definitions of time.

360
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:22,590
My local external time arrow is whatever direction I see entropy increasing the most.

361
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:37,110
1: So, again, I would refer to people like Rovelli and Max Tegmark, who developed many of these ideas.

362
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:41,100
Awesome.

363
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:58,222
All right, thank you, Chris, and Ander, looking forward to seeing everyone's questions submitted and their preparation and participation and measurement in the discussion section.

364
01:00:58,366 --> 01:01:00,162
So thank you.

365
01:01:00,296 --> 01:01:01,026
Till next time.

366
01:01:01,048 --> 01:01:01,634
All right.

367
01:01:01,752 --> 01:01:03,102
1: Thanks again, Daniel.

368
01:01:03,246 --> 01:01:03,714
Thank you.

369
01:01:03,752 --> 01:01:05,938
Ander, we'll see you later.

370
01:01:06,104 --> 01:01:06,930
Bye.
