CHRIS FIELDS: Thank you and welcome to Physics as

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,570
Information Processing, session Three,

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,330
which is about quantum reference frames.

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,330
So in this course, we've talked about

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,402
quantum information theory, which we

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:55,450
characterized as a general theory

18
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,094
that describes the exchange of

19
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:00,490
information, exchange of finite

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,442
information between two finite

21
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:06,602
agents that are separated by some

22
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:09,746
boundary. And we emphasize that this is

23
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:12,222
a topological theory, not a geometric

24
00:01:12,286 --> 00:01:15,330
theory, so it makes no assumptions about

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,330
an embedding spacetime.

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,062
And last time we showed how to

27
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:27,080
characterize this boundary of script B

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,240
as an array of N,

29
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,050
some finite N quantum bits or qubits,

30
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,294
and how to characterize the interaction

31
00:01:38,422 --> 00:01:42,490
of the agents A and B with the boundary

32
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,826
as an alternating cycle of preparing

33
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:50,830
and measuring the qubits in this array.

34
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,754
And we showed that their interaction

35
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:56,190
could be represented as a sum of

36
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,074
operators, each of which act on just one

37
00:01:59,112 --> 00:02:03,460
of the qubits. And we also talked about

38
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,506
the need for each of the agents A and B

39
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:10,534
to choose a reference frame for their

40
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:14,230
interaction with the qubits that defined

41
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,814
which way was up. So what

42
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:22,138
the orientations of the qubits meant and

43
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:26,266
emphasized that the two observers A

44
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:29,174
and B could choose different reference

45
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:32,822
frames, so different ways of measuring

46
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:36,846
and preparing their qubits that use

47
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,160
different meanings for the idea of up

48
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,226
for each qubit. And we ended

49
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:48,514
the last session with a pointer forward

50
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:50,866
toward the quantum formulation of the

51
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:53,714
free energy principle, which can be

52
00:02:53,752 --> 00:02:56,014
stated as the claim that interacting

53
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:58,126
systems behave in a way that aligns

54
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,146
their reference frames. And pointed

55
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:05,814
out at that time that what this means is

56
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,882
that the two agents A and B approach

57
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:11,666
entanglement asymptotically, and that

58
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,326
therefore the FEP is a classical limit

59
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:17,274
of the principle of unitarity, which is

60
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:19,014
the core principle of quantum theory.

61
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:21,914
So we'll see in this session why this is

62
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,386
true. So what we'll

63
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:28,874
talk about today is what reference

64
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:32,574
frames are in general, how they

65
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,570
make observations and actions

66
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,986
meaningful, so how they give physics a

67
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:39,906
semantics, and then we'll talk about the

68
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,330
free energy principle.

69
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,540
So what is a reference frame? The idea

70
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,850
that physics involves reference frames

71
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,934
goes back at least to Galileo, but was

72
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:56,822
probably familiar well before that,

73
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:58,966
just not formalized in the way that

74
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,160
Galileo formalized it.

75
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,786
So the key idea can be thought of in

76
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:08,554
terms of motion. And you're all

77
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:10,698
familiar, for example, with riding a

78
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:14,022
bicycle or driving a car and seeing

79
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:17,102
the world as if it's passing by you at

80
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,206
some velocity, with some velocity. And

81
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:21,918
of course, with respect to the world

82
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:24,830
you're passing by it with some velocity.

83
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,602
And this idea that velocity is

84
00:04:29,656 --> 00:04:33,602
not absolute but that's relative to

85
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:36,530
some observer who measures it in some

86
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,574
reference frame is the foundation for

87
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,882
theories of relativity. So Galileo

88
00:04:42,946 --> 00:04:46,310
developed his theory of relativity which

89
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,962
basically was just a way of converting

90
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:51,126
from classical velocities measured by

91
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:53,270
one observer to classical velocities

92
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,314
measured by another observer that was

93
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:58,410
moving with respect to the first one.

94
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,634
And this provided the foundation for

95
00:05:00,672 --> 00:05:04,474
Einstein's theories of relativity which

96
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:08,730
modified Galileo's by adding the concept

97
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,894
that the observers have to change

98
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:14,430
exchange information and can only

99
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,446
exchange it at the speed of light which

100
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:17,490
is finite.

101
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,970
So this idea in physics has a long

102
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,554
history. Of course, the core idea is

103
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:29,542
that measurements are always with

104
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:33,094
respect to something or other. And the

105
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,202
something or other is a reference frame

106
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:37,190
and different agents can choose

107
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,214
different reference frames. And this

108
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,566
idea is very old. Here we have a picture

109
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:45,786
of anubis choosing a feather as the

110
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:48,502
reference frame with which to measure

111
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:51,514
the heart of the pharaoh. So this goes

112
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,906
back to well before the common era.

113
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,950
This is about 2000 BCE.

114
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,942
So this is a very old idea that's been

115
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:04,714
elaborated over the centuries as science

116
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:09,522
has developed and in the

117
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:12,514
fairly big change in how this idea was

118
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:15,662
thought about occurred in classical

119
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:18,242
physics reference frames were always

120
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:20,710
thought of as mathematical abstractions

121
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,642
and an observer and a reference frame

122
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:27,750
were more or less identified by Galileo.

123
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,434
And that identification is carried

124
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:33,386
forward into Einstein who thinks about

125
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:35,914
observers, for example, sitting on

126
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:39,866
photons and observers in spaceships and

127
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:42,426
observers riding on railroad trains and

128
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:44,414
this sort of thing. And always that just

129
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:47,114
means think of a reference frame that's

130
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:48,720
doing something or other.

131
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,854
So a

132
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:56,554
reference frame in classical physics is

133
00:06:56,612 --> 00:07:01,298
essentially just a coordinate system and

134
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,786
these abstract coordinate systems can be

135
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:07,922
employed in thought experiments and

136
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:10,578
so they are a way to illustrate

137
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:13,350
classical intuitions about motion.

138
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,366
And in the 90s, as quantum information

139
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:21,320
theory developed it was realized that

140
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,834
a reference frame actually consists of a

141
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:28,138
physical object. I mean, even in the

142
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:31,754
picture from the Egyptian tomb the

143
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,250
reference frame is a physical feather.

144
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,034
And that means that the reference frame

145
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:42,554
itself is described by quantum theory.

146
00:07:42,602 --> 00:07:44,560
It's some quantum system.

147
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,686
And if you think about reference frames

148
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,326
that are familiar for example, meter

149
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:53,726
sticks for measuring distance or clocks

150
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:56,738
for measuring time or gyroscopes or

151
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,094
batteries or even the Earth's

152
00:07:58,142 --> 00:08:00,322
gravitational fields which typically

153
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:04,194
defines up for us those are all physical

154
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:06,306
objects that can be described by quantum

155
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:09,126
theory. Well, this was an important

156
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:13,194
insight because it led to

157
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:16,982
the realization that reference frames

158
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:20,490
as quantum systems are unique.

159
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,542
And uniqueness in quantum theory is very

160
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:28,026
strong. There's the no Cloning

161
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:29,930
theorem which states that you can't

162
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,874
reproduce exactly reproduce any unknown

163
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:36,634
quantum state. And that

164
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:40,210
applies to reference frames because they

165
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,426
encode what Bartlett et al. In that

166
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:46,180
paper called non fungible information

167
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,098
which just means information that can't

168
00:08:49,134 --> 00:08:52,130
be completely represented in any finite

169
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,814
bit string. So unless you know the

170
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,506
state of a reference frame, you can't

171
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,754
clone it. Since these reference

172
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:04,374
frames encode more

173
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:06,490
than any bit string's worth of

174
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,610
information in their quantum phases,

175
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,974
they're unique and their states are

176
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,094
unknown. And the consequence of this is

177
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:21,566
that if Alice wants Bob to use

178
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:23,726
her reference frame to make a

179
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:26,618
measurement, she can't just send him a

180
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:29,810
description. She has to actually send

181
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,410
the reference frame.

182
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,182
And this has an important consequence

183
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:40,370
for physics because it makes all

184
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,790
replicate measurements approximate

185
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,582
because observers obviously aren't using

186
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:49,894
exactly the same physical objects as

187
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:52,586
their reference frames. But there's a

188
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,460
deeper implication of this,

189
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,382
which is that Alice's ultimate

190
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:02,186
rock bottom reference frame is actually

191
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:05,630
implemented by her body, by her brain.

192
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,106
And using any external reference frame

193
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:13,114
requires having this internal reference

194
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:15,722
frame that makes the external reference

195
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:18,814
frame meaningful and usable. So,

196
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,586
for example, this thing is a piece of a

197
00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:23,902
meter stick, a third of a meter stick.

198
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:25,682
But for me to use it to make

199
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:28,754
measurements, I have to actually have

200
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,782
some concept of distance. And that

201
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:34,374
concept of distance is implemented by my

202
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:38,482
nervous system. And that implementation

203
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:41,990
is my reference frame for length.

204
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,490
And it's what gives meaning to any

205
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,206
external measurement of length. It's

206
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:52,230
what makes my measurements of length

207
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,602
actionable by me using my effectors

208
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,974
or action capabilities, whatever they

209
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:03,578
are. So my internal reference frames

210
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:06,366
are what make information I get from the

211
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:09,886
world actionable. And in Bates

212
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,938
and sense of differences that make a

213
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:14,834
difference, actionability is the core of

214
00:11:14,872 --> 00:11:17,666
semantics. Something is meaningful if I

215
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:21,718
can do something about it. So this idea

216
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:27,042
that we all contain embodied

217
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:30,166
reference frames gives physics a

218
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:33,058
semantics by giving observers a

219
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:35,580
semantics. And this is new.

220
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,146
This is an idea that never really

221
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:41,482
appeared in physics before that

222
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:44,334
measurements automatically had to have

223
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:47,594
some kind of semantics. But reference

224
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:51,550
frames give semantics to measurements.

225
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,202
So here's an example of an embodied

226
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:59,134
reference frame. This is the reference

227
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:02,958
frame that bacteria use for chemotaxis

228
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:06,386
I. E. To move toward molecules in the

229
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:09,166
environment that they like, like sugars

230
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:11,606
and to move away from molecules that

231
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:14,818
they don't like, like acids. And it's

232
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,222
been worked out in great detail over

233
00:12:17,356 --> 00:12:19,526
decades of experimental work. And this

234
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:23,094
is a rough schematic. The reference

235
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,130
frame has three parts.

236
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,738
There's the measurement part, which is

237
00:12:29,824 --> 00:12:32,314
conveniently located in the front of the

238
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:35,614
bacterium. And it consists of a bunch of

239
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:37,950
receptors that probe the environment.

240
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,646
And they can bind molecules, which are

241
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:44,346
called ligands, out in the environment.

242
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:47,374
And when they bind them, they send a

243
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:50,250
signal into the back of the bacterium.

244
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,854
And it turns out that there's a little

245
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:54,154
miniature reference frame attached

246
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:56,638
directly to these ligands which is this

247
00:12:56,804 --> 00:12:59,782
r and B system which control the

248
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,754
ligands, not the ligands, the receptor

249
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:06,166
sensitivity. Then the back of

250
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:08,290
the reference frame is the action

251
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,650
component and it consists of a set of

252
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,650
molecules that control a motor,

253
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,594
a molecular motor, that drives the

254
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:21,882
flagella on the bacteria. And the

255
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:25,358
flagellum allows it to swim forwards or

256
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:28,510
turn in some other direction. And

257
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,154
depending on how it spins, the creature

258
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:33,934
either goes in the direction of

259
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:36,026
something it likes or it stops and turns

260
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:40,660
around. And the stuff in the middle is

261
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,586
a little molecular feedback loop that

262
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:49,414
represents the amount of ligand in the

263
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:51,826
environment that the bacterium expects

264
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:54,726
to see. So this is the middle of the

265
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:56,822
reference frame and it defines the

266
00:13:56,876 --> 00:14:00,214
default value for what the bacterium is

267
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:04,074
observing in its environment. And if

268
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:05,962
you're thinking in terms of the free

269
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:08,774
energy principle or Bayesian inference,

270
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:10,602
then you'll immediately see the

271
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:12,554
concentration of this molecule is

272
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:15,470
encoding a prior probability, the

273
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,046
bacterium's prior probability for what

274
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:21,790
its environment is like. And the

275
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,134
zero point, the default value of that

276
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:29,118
encoding, is the ligand concentration

277
00:14:29,214 --> 00:14:31,300
in which the bacterium does nothing.

278
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,860
So a QRF in general

279
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,654
can be characterized as an expected

280
00:14:38,702 --> 00:14:41,362
value, which is here the concentration

281
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:45,426
of this molecule p y phosphorylated

282
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,182
plus a bunch of computation, which is

283
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:49,862
all the rest of the things in this

284
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:53,660
diagram. So this is a very simple

285
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,130
QRF that's embodied by a bacteria.

286
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,690
Here's a more complicated QRF that's

287
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,482
embodied by eukaryotic cells,

288
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:07,854
or more complicated cells like our

289
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:11,950
cells. And this is the reference frame

290
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,626
that makes decisions about whether cells

291
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:19,250
are going to divide. So on the top

292
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,058
you see the cell's membrane, and there

293
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:22,866
are all sorts of receptors sticking out

294
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:26,226
of it that detect hormones and

295
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:28,834
neurotransmitters and growth factors and

296
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:30,726
this, that, and the other thing, many of

297
00:15:30,748 --> 00:15:32,790
which are produced by other cells.

298
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,650
And those receptors communicate

299
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,560
via a lot of chemistry with

300
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,434
the nucleus, which is contained in

301
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:49,226
another membrane and so

302
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:53,062
serves as, in a sense, the outside upon

303
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:55,710
which the reference frame is acting.

304
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,958
And what this reference frame does is

305
00:15:59,044 --> 00:16:02,094
control the transcription of large

306
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:04,286
numbers of molecules from DNA. So it

307
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:06,414
basically controls what proteins the

308
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:09,106
cell is making. And those proteins end

309
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:10,894
up doing something like restructuring

310
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:13,762
the cytoplasm and actually driving cell

311
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:16,866
division. And the stuff in the middle of

312
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:19,986
this reference frame, which I've labeled

313
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:23,190
the integrative center, are three

314
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,030
molecules called RAF, mech and ERC.

315
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,554
And they're connected by positive by bi

316
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:35,130
directional feedback loops. And they

317
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,460
basically negotiate the default value

318
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,794
of the environment at which the

319
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:46,346
cell does nothing. So they're

320
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:49,022
the middle of the reference frame that

321
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:52,010
represents the cell's expectation values

322
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,062
about what's going on in its

323
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:57,570
environment. So you can imagine now what

324
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,854
reference frames encoded by our nervous

325
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:01,870
system look like. They're extremely

326
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,942
complicated and exist at multiple

327
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:07,682
scales, from the scale of molecules in

328
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,594
cells to the scale of large scale

329
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:14,646
connections between parts of our

330
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:18,006
brains. So how

331
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:19,960
do we represent all this stuff?

332
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,074
There are many ways to do this, but this

333
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:27,020
is a particularly simple way.

334
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,906
It assumes that whatever's in the

335
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:35,360
middle, which is here called C prime is

336
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,822
the most general thing that

337
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:43,438
the inputs can give information to and

338
00:17:43,524 --> 00:17:46,222
the most general thing that can give

339
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:50,130
information to the outputs. And most

340
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,974
general here has a category theoretic

341
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:56,834
definition so it

342
00:17:56,872 --> 00:18:01,074
can be stated in a way that's equivalent

343
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,214
across many different specific

344
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:07,474
mathematical forms. But if you're

345
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:10,054
familiar with neural networks, this will

346
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:12,986
look to you a lot like the skeleton of a

347
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,006
variational auto encoder. And that's

348
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:19,706
basically what it is. And I don't want

349
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:22,634
to deal with this formalism except to

350
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:24,542
say that it exists and is very

351
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:28,238
convenient, except to say that we can

352
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:31,882
attach this kind of formal

353
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:36,010
diagram as a representation of a QRF

354
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,262
to our representation of the boundary

355
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:43,474
between two interacting agents. And we

356
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:48,322
can use these formal structures to

357
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:50,662
drive the measurement operators that

358
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:53,046
actually implement physical changes on

359
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:57,058
this boundary. And I'll

360
00:18:57,154 --> 00:19:00,310
represent this whole business with just

361
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,566
a triangle labeled Q for some QRF that's

362
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:07,754
attached to the boundary. And we can use

363
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:12,102
this simple notation then to investigate

364
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:15,774
what sorts of structures one gets when

365
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:18,222
one starts to think about systems as

366
00:19:18,276 --> 00:19:20,830
implementing specific QRFs.

367
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,866
And here's the structure of the minimal

368
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:28,370
system that we can really think of as an

369
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,986
interesting observer. And this is

370
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:35,986
a system that has some QRF that

371
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,834
I've called E that looks at its

372
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,834
environment, the part of its environment

373
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:44,600
that it can actually observe and act on,

374
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,238
and it defines a sector of

375
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:53,386
the boundary which mathematically is

376
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:58,700
just the image of this Qrfe that

377
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,786
the system can manipulate. So this is

378
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:04,366
the part of the environment or the part

379
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:06,206
of the boundary that the system actually

380
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:08,560
sees and can do something about.

381
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,680
And for this observer to be interesting,

382
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,698
it needs to be able to detect the

383
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:20,322
difference between what it sees now and

384
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:23,986
what it saw just then so that

385
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:26,082
it can decide whether to take some

386
00:20:26,136 --> 00:20:29,578
action or other. So it needs a memory

387
00:20:29,774 --> 00:20:33,590
and that requires another QRF that

388
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,290
has some allocated piece of the boundary

389
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,610
recall. The boundary is where classical

390
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,422
information gets written in this purely

391
00:20:42,486 --> 00:20:44,570
quantum theoretic formalism.

392
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,906
So it needs a memory sector that that

393
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:52,634
QRF can act on. And then in

394
00:20:52,672 --> 00:20:55,742
order to do this computation and

395
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,886
specifically in order to write

396
00:20:57,988 --> 00:21:01,342
information to the boundary, in order

397
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:04,030
to actually flip bits on the boundary,

398
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,034
it needs free energy. So the rest of its

399
00:21:08,072 --> 00:21:12,222
boundary gets devoted to extracting

400
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:14,834
free energy from the environment and

401
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:17,826
exhausting free energy, waste heat, in

402
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:20,326
other words, into the environment. And

403
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:22,514
so it has this nice little thermodynamic

404
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:26,182
cycle that drives everything else. And

405
00:21:26,236 --> 00:21:30,518
finally, in order to tell now from

406
00:21:30,604 --> 00:21:33,914
just a second ago the information in

407
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:37,818
memory, it needs a clock that

408
00:21:37,904 --> 00:21:41,530
marks the information in memory as not

409
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,800
current, so as past information.

410
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,634
And if it can store multiple memory

411
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,200
records, it needs to be able to count

412
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,474
and say this piece of remembered

413
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,282
information is actually more recent than

414
00:21:57,336 --> 00:22:00,674
that piece over there. So it has to

415
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:03,554
implement a little internal clock, and

416
00:22:03,592 --> 00:22:07,490
that clock is its internal time QRF.

417
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,342
And we've seen that QRFs act on

418
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,486
boundaries. This clock acts on a

419
00:22:12,508 --> 00:22:16,054
boundary, but it doesn't act on B. It

420
00:22:16,092 --> 00:22:20,466
acts on an internal boundary that's

421
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:22,874
essentially the boundary between it the

422
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:25,706
clock and the points at the ends of

423
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:28,278
these QRFs that actually encode

424
00:22:28,374 --> 00:22:30,346
information that's either read from the

425
00:22:30,368 --> 00:22:32,154
environment or written to the

426
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,694
environment. So already this

427
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:38,574
minimal observer has a little bit of

428
00:22:38,612 --> 00:22:40,350
hierarchical structure,

429
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,382
which is that its clock has to, in some

430
00:22:44,436 --> 00:22:46,950
sense, be higher up in the hierarchy

431
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,222
than the parts, the QRFs that interact

432
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:54,386
directly with the environment. So if you

433
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:57,746
have a structure like this, you face a

434
00:22:57,768 --> 00:23:01,442
metabolic trade off for a fixed amount

435
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:04,054
of energy that you can extract from the

436
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:07,510
environment. You can allocate it either

437
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,990
into learning more about the environment

438
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,746
or remembering more about what you

439
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:13,740
learned before.

440
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,962
So any system has to make this

441
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:21,802
decision about how they're going to use

442
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,594
energy. Are they going to devote it to

443
00:23:23,632 --> 00:23:26,638
learning more or remembering more. And

444
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:29,674
your laptop makes that decision. Memory

445
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:32,794
is cheap for your laptop. Your brain

446
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:34,734
makes that decision. Memory is much more

447
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:37,614
expensive for your brain. And all cells

448
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:39,794
have to make that decision. And the

449
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:43,678
universal solution to this trade

450
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:46,882
off is course grading memory. I e.

451
00:23:46,936 --> 00:23:48,946
Remembering things in less detail than

452
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:51,578
you saw them in the beginning. Ander Aguirre,

453
00:23:51,614 --> 00:23:54,278
you have a comment?

454
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:56,438
ANDER AGUIRRE: Yes, I wanted to ask a question now before it

455
00:23:56,444 --> 00:23:58,514
gets too late. So two or three slides

456
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:02,458
ago, when we were looking at the

457
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:06,474
diagram of the coconut diagrams, I was

458
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:10,694
wondering if the classifiers

459
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,106
identified with measurement and

460
00:24:12,128 --> 00:24:14,258
preparation. Those correspond to sensory

461
00:24:14,374 --> 00:24:16,894
and action degrees of freedom in the

462
00:24:16,932 --> 00:24:19,440
earlier picture with the bacteria and

463
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,438
the classifier in the middle in

464
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:24,894
that picture, would it correspond to the

465
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:27,102
default chemical concentration? That

466
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:29,806
yes, exactly. Okay,

467
00:24:29,988 --> 00:24:31,380
perfect. Yeah.

468
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,114
That crossing point in the middle is

469
00:24:36,152 --> 00:24:37,874
specifically where the default is

470
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:41,586
encoded. Thank you for pointing

471
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:42,360
that out.

472
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,950
Okay, so let's follow the consequences

473
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,020
of this metabolic issue.

474
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,134
If you have a system that's a little bit

475
00:24:55,172 --> 00:24:58,222
smarter than our minimal system that can

476
00:24:58,276 --> 00:25:00,350
actually detect and measure the states

477
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,110
of objects, it has to do even more

478
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,182
work because it has to encode even more

479
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:10,914
QRFs. So think of measuring the state

480
00:25:10,952 --> 00:25:13,586
of some object like a volt meter in a

481
00:25:13,608 --> 00:25:16,306
laboratory. If I tell you to go into the

482
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:18,286
lab and tell me what the voltmeter is

483
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:20,566
reading, then the first thing you have

484
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:23,734
to do is find the voltmeter. And your

485
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,502
process of finding the voltmeter is

486
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:28,914
independent of your process of reading

487
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:32,170
what it's actually saying on its dial.

488
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,514
So in order to measure the state of an

489
00:25:35,552 --> 00:25:39,114
object, you have to have two QRFs one

490
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:42,234
that lets you find the object, and then

491
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:44,014
the other that lets you measure the

492
00:25:44,052 --> 00:25:48,206
state of interest of the object. And we

493
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:50,730
call these the R sector for reference

494
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,294
that lets you find the object and the P

495
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:56,820
sector for pointer because old

496
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,554
instruments used to have pointers on

497
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:02,820
dials that read analog numbers.

498
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,270
But what thinking about object

499
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,470
identification tells you is that every

500
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,258
object that you can identify leads

501
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:20,618
to having to sector both the informative

502
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:23,710
part of your boundary and the memory

503
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,922
part of your boundary into two new

504
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:29,746
sectors one to store information about

505
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:33,506
object identification and one to store

506
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:35,942
information about the states of those

507
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:39,222
objects. So this requires much more

508
00:26:39,276 --> 00:26:42,440
metabolism. And again,

509
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,234
the solution is coarse grain.

510
00:26:45,362 --> 00:26:47,586
Typically, what we coarse grain is our

511
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:50,086
memory of the object that we've

512
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:53,866
identified. So what

513
00:26:53,888 --> 00:26:56,250
does this do to systems?

514
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,880
Because making measurements costs energy

515
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:07,530
and recording memories costs

516
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,178
energy. We have to make decisions

517
00:27:11,274 --> 00:27:15,090
about what QRS to use at what

518
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,558
time. Given our finite energy budgets,

519
00:27:18,734 --> 00:27:20,946
we can't look at the world with all of

520
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:23,202
our measurement capabilities at the same

521
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:27,880
time because it's too expensive. And now

522
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,286
we see the effect of a theorem in

523
00:27:33,308 --> 00:27:36,374
quantum information theory which is that

524
00:27:36,412 --> 00:27:39,222
if two QRFs can't be deployed

525
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:44,058
simultaneously for whatever reason that

526
00:27:44,144 --> 00:27:47,210
corresponds to them not commuting as

527
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,574
operators and if they don't commute as

528
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:53,386
operators, they have to be implemented

529
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:56,030
by compartments that are separable. So

530
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,090
compartments that only communicate

531
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,706
classically. The consequence

532
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:04,962
of this theorem is that as soon

533
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,900
as one has too many

534
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,970
sensory and motor capabilities to run

535
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,210
all at the same time, given your energy

536
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,670
budget you end up being

537
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,374
compartmentalized into compartments that

538
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:22,806
only communicate classically. So you end

539
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:26,518
up looking like this diagram where there

540
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,020
are a bunch of components that do

541
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,250
sensory motor, loops or memory,

542
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,762
one or the other and they can only

543
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:39,334
communicate classically. And they're

544
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:42,490
controlled by some sort of attention

545
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,982
system that selects which

546
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:49,534
ones to activate depending on the amount

547
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:52,850
of free energy that's available. And

548
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,654
clearly, this clock function becomes

549
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,500
part of this control system.

550
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,794
So the physics alone of

551
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,880
any system that's acting as

552
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,930
that executes a fairly complicated

553
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,494
interaction with its environment gives

554
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:16,498
us this hierarchical compartmentalized

555
00:29:16,594 --> 00:29:20,330
structure without having to add

556
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,782
any biological or cognitive science

557
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,980
type assumptions at all.

558
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,674
So we can go in three directions from

559
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:32,766
this. We can go deeper into the

560
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:34,334
biology which we're going to do in

561
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,894
October. We can go deeper into the

562
00:29:36,932 --> 00:29:38,782
physics which we're going to do in

563
00:29:38,836 --> 00:29:42,094
August and September and we can

564
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:45,230
go deeper into this issue of alignment

565
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,220
which is what we're going to do today.

566
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,026
So there are four possibilities. If you

567
00:29:51,048 --> 00:29:54,206
think about two agents that have QRFs

568
00:29:54,318 --> 00:29:57,814
that are interacting across this

569
00:29:57,852 --> 00:30:00,870
boundary and the first one is trivial.

570
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,534
If the B agent, the agent on the right

571
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:08,418
side, doesn't actually employ

572
00:30:08,524 --> 00:30:11,018
any QRFs if it just interacts with the

573
00:30:11,024 --> 00:30:14,394
boundary thermally, then there is no

574
00:30:14,432 --> 00:30:16,554
alignment. You're in a trivial situation

575
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:19,002
where A can measure something about B,

576
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:20,380
but not in return.

577
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:26,634
If the B agent deploys a QRF

578
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:29,502
that's much broader in scope than the A

579
00:30:29,556 --> 00:30:31,840
agent what we show here in panel B,

580
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,722
then the A agent can learn something

581
00:30:34,776 --> 00:30:37,954
about the B agent but misses most of

582
00:30:37,992 --> 00:30:39,860
what the B agent is doing.

583
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,886
In panel C, we have agents with QRFs

584
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:49,366
of the same size on the boundary, but

585
00:30:49,388 --> 00:30:51,622
they're not lined up correctly. So each

586
00:30:51,676 --> 00:30:53,814
one misses part of what the other is

587
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,046
doing. And finally, indeed, we have the

588
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:59,478
optimal situation where they have QRFs

589
00:30:59,494 --> 00:31:02,138
of the same size and they're actually

590
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:05,722
lined up. So each sees what the other is

591
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:08,106
doing, at least on this sector of the

592
00:31:08,128 --> 00:31:11,360
boundary. And since the agents have to

593
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,614
allocate some of the boundary to free

594
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:15,774
energy supply and can't look at that

595
00:31:15,812 --> 00:31:17,866
part, then they can't tell what's

596
00:31:17,898 --> 00:31:20,718
happening across their entire

597
00:31:20,804 --> 00:31:22,686
boundaries. They can only tell what's

598
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:25,714
happening in this sector where they can

599
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:27,730
actually deploy a QRF.

600
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,060
But let's now look at this interesting

601
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:36,146
situation, situation D, where the

602
00:31:36,168 --> 00:31:39,160
QRFs are allied between A and B.

603
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,206
As I said, that's the optimal channel

604
00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:46,774
for A and B. And if

605
00:31:46,812 --> 00:31:50,282
we think about this, we can write the

606
00:31:50,336 --> 00:31:52,522
variational free energy or the

607
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:57,770
uncertainty or the prediction error for

608
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,210
A for the Qrfx

609
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,662
as the action that

610
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:09,530
it sees I E B's

611
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,946
action, the difference between that

612
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:16,306
and what it expects B to do. So what

613
00:32:16,328 --> 00:32:18,930
it can predict about B's action.

614
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,674
And this is just the notion of free

615
00:32:22,712 --> 00:32:25,762
energy from the free energy principle,

616
00:32:25,826 --> 00:32:29,862
except translated into this

617
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:33,640
situation where we have two QRFs and

618
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,466
A can measure what B has done, but it

619
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:42,970
can also use its QRF to predict,

620
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,490
because it's predicting the very state

621
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,594
that it's going to observe next of the

622
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:51,920
same sector that B is using.

623
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,710
Now, if we look at this diagram,

624
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,062
we can see easily that the way to

625
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:03,282
minimize the variational free energy and

626
00:33:03,336 --> 00:33:06,050
therefore maximize predictive capability

627
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,514
is for these two QRFs to actually be the

628
00:33:10,552 --> 00:33:14,942
same. So if A is

629
00:33:15,016 --> 00:33:18,566
doing the same thing to the

630
00:33:18,588 --> 00:33:22,610
boundary that B is a can predict B's

631
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,022
next action perfectly because

632
00:33:26,156 --> 00:33:28,700
B is going to do whatever A is doing.

633
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,874
So what the

634
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,354
free energy principle tells us in this

635
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:40,800
case is that A and B,

636
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,302
as they minimize their variational free

637
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,802
energies, will approach having identical

638
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:51,118
QRFs. Well, again,

639
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:54,594
we have a theorem that tells us that if

640
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,746
these QRFs are shared, a and B

641
00:33:57,768 --> 00:34:00,210
are not separable but entangled.

642
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,842
And this is also fairly easy to see

643
00:34:03,896 --> 00:34:06,146
because it depends on this notion of non

644
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:07,190
fungibility.

645
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,674
If XA and XB both encode non fungible

646
00:34:12,722 --> 00:34:14,626
information, which is quantum systems,

647
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:18,810
they do. Their states aren't clonable,

648
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,154
so they can't be copies of each other

649
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:25,894
because one can't clone an unknown

650
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:30,126
system. So they can only be identical if

651
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:32,430
they're actually identical systems.

652
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,310
This is exactly the same point made

653
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,814
earlier about Alice having to actually

654
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:42,994
send her QRF to Bob if she wants Bob to

655
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:44,850
use her QRF.

656
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,210
So minimizing VFE

657
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,054
for quantum systems is becoming

658
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:56,534
entangled. So the classical free

659
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:58,374
energy principle, which tells us to

660
00:34:58,412 --> 00:35:01,714
minimize VFE actually drives quantum

661
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:04,306
systems toward entanglement. And that's

662
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:06,066
why it's a special case of the principle

663
00:35:06,098 --> 00:35:09,530
of unitarity which just says that any

664
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,554
isolated joint system is going to

665
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:15,450
asymptotically approach entanglement.

666
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,150
So this raises an obvious question,

667
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,682
which is why all of us aren't entangled

668
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,822
with our environments all the time and

669
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:27,360
entangled with each other?

670
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,362
And the answer is that entanglement is

671
00:35:32,436 --> 00:35:36,354
really hard for complex systems. And

672
00:35:36,392 --> 00:35:40,114
this illustrates the sense in which the

673
00:35:40,152 --> 00:35:43,010
FEP is moving systems in two different

674
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,466
directions at once. The FEP

675
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,542
is driving systems to maintain their

676
00:35:49,596 --> 00:35:52,610
separability but it's also driving

677
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,342
systems toward entanglement. And as

678
00:35:56,396 --> 00:35:58,566
the system becomes more and more complex

679
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:01,050
the difference between those two

680
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,690
outcomes becomes larger and larger.

681
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,154
So recall from last time that the

682
00:36:08,192 --> 00:36:11,614
condition for separability is that the

683
00:36:11,652 --> 00:36:14,494
two systems have dimensions that are

684
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:16,574
much larger than the dimension of their

685
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:20,654
boundary. And this is the condition that

686
00:36:20,692 --> 00:36:22,866
allows them to have internal states, to

687
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:24,782
have them have states that aren't

688
00:36:24,846 --> 00:36:27,810
located on their boundaries. And

689
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,018
clearly, to formulate the free energy

690
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,894
principle you have to have internal

691
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:36,166
states. So if you do

692
00:36:36,188 --> 00:36:39,094
a complex QRF that's in a lot of

693
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:41,846
computation then you need a lot of

694
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:44,194
internal degrees of freedom to implement

695
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:47,174
that computation. So you need a lot of

696
00:36:47,212 --> 00:36:49,530
internal state. So you have to have

697
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,850
large dimensions. So complexity

698
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,782
favors separability. As a system becomes

699
00:36:57,846 --> 00:37:00,654
more complex, it has to have more

700
00:37:00,692 --> 00:37:03,118
internal states. So it has to be, in a

701
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:05,546
sense, more separable from whatever it's

702
00:37:05,578 --> 00:37:09,182
interacting with. Now, think about this

703
00:37:09,236 --> 00:37:12,310
classically. If you have a complex

704
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,410
system that's doing a lot of computation

705
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,740
then it requires a lot of free energy

706
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,190
and it has to dissipate a lot of entropy

707
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:26,854
in the form of heat, typically but

708
00:37:26,972 --> 00:37:30,134
something, some form of energy transfer

709
00:37:30,252 --> 00:37:32,982
that its environment is going to see as

710
00:37:33,036 --> 00:37:35,350
noise, as not informative.

711
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:40,554
So a complex system is working very

712
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,682
hard to predict its environment's next

713
00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:46,454
state. But by working very hard it's

714
00:37:46,502 --> 00:37:48,314
dumping a lot of entropy into its

715
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:51,118
environment. And putting in that extra

716
00:37:51,204 --> 00:37:55,050
entropy makes the environment's behavior

717
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,014
even harder to predict. So the more you

718
00:37:58,052 --> 00:37:59,754
work at predicting what the environment

719
00:37:59,802 --> 00:38:03,186
is going to do the more you yourself

720
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:05,650
make the environment's behavior less

721
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:10,014
predictable. And this is the paradox

722
00:38:10,062 --> 00:38:12,034
of the FEP, which is not really a

723
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:14,238
paradox. It's just what the physics

724
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,846
does. So we can think of

725
00:38:17,868 --> 00:38:21,400
the FEP by driving systems to

726
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,790
increase their distinctness from their

727
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,786
environments or to self evidence, as

728
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:29,500
Karl Friston calls it,

729
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:35,158
as driving this increased

730
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:38,806
complexity that both makes predictions

731
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:42,298
better and makes predictions harder

732
00:38:42,394 --> 00:38:44,414
by transferring entropy into the

733
00:38:44,452 --> 00:38:47,822
environment. So what this tells us is

734
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:52,674
that the FEP by itself will

735
00:38:52,712 --> 00:38:54,882
drive the development of systems with

736
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:58,498
larger and larger complexity. And this

737
00:38:58,664 --> 00:39:01,954
clearly has enormous implications for

738
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:04,354
evolutionary theory which we'll talk

739
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:05,830
about in October.

740
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,134
But I want to emphasize here that this

741
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:13,046
is just the physics. It's just what the

742
00:39:13,068 --> 00:39:16,594
FEP does when it's forced to maintain

743
00:39:16,642 --> 00:39:17,510
a boundary.

744
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,780
And before stopping here,

745
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:27,702
I want to consider one aspect

746
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:30,830
of this in particular, which is

747
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,058
language. For example, human language,

748
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:37,982
but any kind of language connecting any

749
00:39:38,036 --> 00:39:41,386
systems that are communicating with QRFs

750
00:39:41,418 --> 00:39:44,866
that are fairly close. And language is a

751
00:39:44,888 --> 00:39:48,882
complex QRF that we basically

752
00:39:49,016 --> 00:39:51,410
share. Otherwise, things like this

753
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,254
interaction would be impossible, but we

754
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,694
also remain distinct systems. So the

755
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:01,334
question arises, how do we manage to do

756
00:40:01,372 --> 00:40:04,710
this? How do we manage to largely share

757
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,014
a QRF while escaping,

758
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:09,530
becoming entangled?

759
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,094
And this is a question that's largely

760
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:15,898
been ignored in physics because

761
00:40:15,984 --> 00:40:17,942
physicists have tended to ignore

762
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:22,650
language and just assume that observers

763
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,086
can communicate classically. So, for

764
00:40:25,108 --> 00:40:28,318
example, in talking about a Belly PR

765
00:40:28,404 --> 00:40:30,074
experiment, which is a canonical

766
00:40:30,122 --> 00:40:32,670
experiment for measuring entanglement,

767
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,650
the observers have to be able to share

768
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,366
their results, or they can't observe

769
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:42,014
entanglement, right? The observed

770
00:40:42,062 --> 00:40:45,098
result is a bunch of observational

771
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:47,186
statistics that violate Bell's

772
00:40:47,218 --> 00:40:49,766
inequality, and those statistics can

773
00:40:49,788 --> 00:40:52,902
only be computed given the results that

774
00:40:52,956 --> 00:40:55,574
both of the observers obtain. So the

775
00:40:55,612 --> 00:40:57,706
observers have to share language to

776
00:40:57,728 --> 00:40:59,290
encode these results.

777
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:03,190
So how come the observers aren't

778
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:06,890
entangled? How come they are still

779
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,694
separable? What we end up appealing

780
00:41:10,742 --> 00:41:13,086
to is some sort of common cause in the

781
00:41:13,108 --> 00:41:15,166
past to explain why they share a

782
00:41:15,188 --> 00:41:17,566
language. They both learned it from

783
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:20,254
their culture, so their culture is some

784
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:23,682
sort of common cause. But all such

785
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:26,610
assumptions are fine tuning assumptions.

786
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:31,202
So they all have basically the

787
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:35,974
status of the

788
00:41:36,012 --> 00:41:37,654
value of something like the fine

789
00:41:37,692 --> 00:41:41,526
structure constant, without which we

790
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:43,186
wouldn't have atoms and so we wouldn't

791
00:41:43,218 --> 00:41:46,726
have us. This value has to

792
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:50,694
be within very small limits

793
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:54,300
of the value we actually observe. And

794
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,642
that's a case of fine tuning. The

795
00:41:57,696 --> 00:42:00,334
universe seems fine tuned in a way that

796
00:42:00,372 --> 00:42:03,486
allows us to exist. And if it

797
00:42:03,508 --> 00:42:05,934
wasn't fine tuned in that way, we

798
00:42:05,972 --> 00:42:07,466
wouldn't exist, and so we wouldn't

799
00:42:07,498 --> 00:42:10,586
observe anything. But fine tuning

800
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:13,074
assumptions are a problem. They're a

801
00:42:13,112 --> 00:42:14,574
pointer to something we don't

802
00:42:14,622 --> 00:42:18,114
understand. And so I just want to leave

803
00:42:18,152 --> 00:42:20,802
you with the point that we have to be

804
00:42:20,856 --> 00:42:23,858
very careful when talking about

805
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:27,702
interacting observers. So in

806
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:31,030
talking about two components of

807
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,454
some system that jointly interact with

808
00:42:34,492 --> 00:42:37,454
some environment but also communicate

809
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:39,594
classically, and if you think back a few

810
00:42:39,632 --> 00:42:43,050
slides, that's exactly the structure

811
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:46,694
that we've shown that the physics forces

812
00:42:46,822 --> 00:42:49,740
any complicated system to have.

813
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,950
So next time, what we're going to focus

814
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,014
on is this very question of how we

815
00:42:58,052 --> 00:43:01,038
describe observers that are both

816
00:43:01,124 --> 00:43:04,354
interacting with the quantum system and

817
00:43:04,472 --> 00:43:07,074
communicating classically in some

818
00:43:07,112 --> 00:43:10,626
language. So that session will

819
00:43:10,648 --> 00:43:13,810
be in August. At the end of this month,

820
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,586
there's a discussion of this session

821
00:43:15,618 --> 00:43:19,062
with Aguirre, and I encourage you all

822
00:43:19,116 --> 00:43:22,786
to use the interactive

823
00:43:22,818 --> 00:43:25,766
Q and A to ask questions. You've been

824
00:43:25,788 --> 00:43:28,634
asking very good questions that I hope

825
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,620
I've been managing to answer.

826
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:34,422
So thank you very much. And Daniel.

827
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:38,314
Over to you. Cool. Well. We have

828
00:43:38,352 --> 00:43:41,680
a few minutes for some questions maybe

829
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,950
and or if you want to bring up any

830
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,120
questions first,

831
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,720
then go for it.

832
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,210
I was curious if you could say any words

833
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,490
on the slide where you had all the

834
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,786
possible alignments of QRFs and what you

835
00:44:00,808 --> 00:44:03,026
meant more by interacting thermally. So

836
00:44:03,048 --> 00:44:04,594
when you have a trivial agent on one

837
00:44:04,632 --> 00:44:07,686
side, what exactly does it mean to say

838
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:09,350
that you're interacting thermally?

839
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,052
If you think about a system that is only

840
00:44:17,106 --> 00:44:18,864
interacting thermally with its

841
00:44:18,902 --> 00:44:19,840
environment,

842
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,792
you end up thinking classically about,

843
00:44:23,846 --> 00:44:27,024
for example, an ideal gas that's in some

844
00:44:27,062 --> 00:44:29,536
sort of container and some of the

845
00:44:29,558 --> 00:44:33,524
molecules are very near the surface and

846
00:44:33,562 --> 00:44:35,556
their motions depend on the motions of

847
00:44:35,578 --> 00:44:37,830
all the other molecules that are inside.

848
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,112
So there's a set of internal

849
00:44:42,176 --> 00:44:46,532
states that interact randomly

850
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:48,824
with the external states that are near

851
00:44:48,862 --> 00:44:51,396
the boundary and so those external

852
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:53,256
states interact randomly with the

853
00:44:53,278 --> 00:44:56,716
boundary. But notice in thinking in

854
00:44:56,738 --> 00:45:00,072
this way, you've imposed a spacetime

855
00:45:00,136 --> 00:45:04,350
embedding, so you've actually used space

856
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,064
as a way of separating the internal

857
00:45:07,112 --> 00:45:08,750
states from the boundary states.

858
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,696
And a system that if

859
00:45:15,718 --> 00:45:18,332
you drop this assumption of a spatial

860
00:45:18,396 --> 00:45:21,472
boundary, then a system that's only

861
00:45:21,526 --> 00:45:23,332
interacting thermally with its

862
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:26,564
environment is going to look like a

863
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:28,420
system that doesn't have any real

864
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,756
internal states. It's going to look like

865
00:45:30,778 --> 00:45:33,030
a system that just has boundary states.

866
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,992
And so a pure thermal interaction is

867
00:45:36,046 --> 00:45:37,192
going to start to look like

868
00:45:37,246 --> 00:45:40,612
entanglement. So we're

869
00:45:40,676 --> 00:45:42,632
actually only really interested in

870
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:44,872
systems that aren't interacting only

871
00:45:44,926 --> 00:45:46,524
purely thermally with their

872
00:45:46,562 --> 00:45:48,924
environments. We're interested in

873
00:45:48,962 --> 00:45:51,464
systems that have enough internal

874
00:45:51,512 --> 00:45:53,884
structure that they're using that

875
00:45:53,922 --> 00:45:55,820
thermal energy to do something

876
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:59,360
internally. So to give

877
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,272
their internal dynamics some particular

878
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:06,172
shape, so that their internal dynamics

879
00:46:06,236 --> 00:46:10,812
is actually circling

880
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:14,628
around some well defined attractor that

881
00:46:14,714 --> 00:46:17,510
requires some energy to maintain itself.

882
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,244
Yeah, I'm continuing with that question.

883
00:46:22,442 --> 00:46:25,412
I saw in the paper free energy principle

884
00:46:25,476 --> 00:46:28,488
for Quantum Systems that if you're in

885
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:31,496
that situation when both keras are

886
00:46:31,518 --> 00:46:34,324
nontrivial, but perhaps B's is larger

887
00:46:34,372 --> 00:46:37,768
than a's ace perceives non

888
00:46:37,784 --> 00:46:40,588
local hidden variables. So I wonder if

889
00:46:40,594 --> 00:46:43,484
there is a way to relate those by taking

890
00:46:43,522 --> 00:46:46,440
a limit of making a small and recover

891
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,936
the thermal interaction. Presumably if

892
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:53,696
you let A become small, you should

893
00:46:53,718 --> 00:46:55,088
recover that thermal interaction, so to

894
00:46:55,094 --> 00:46:58,304
speak. Right? Yeah, that's a very

895
00:46:58,342 --> 00:47:01,444
interesting comment actually. So if

896
00:47:01,482 --> 00:47:04,244
you're a system and all of your

897
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:06,544
environments variables are effectively

898
00:47:06,592 --> 00:47:10,452
hidden to you, then you can't do

899
00:47:10,506 --> 00:47:13,076
any information processing because you

900
00:47:13,098 --> 00:47:15,412
don't have any access to any of your

901
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:18,564
system, your environments variables. So

902
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:20,696
yeah, your interaction can only be

903
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:22,490
thermal. I think that's correct.

904
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,450
Thank you.

905
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,004
Since we're in this, in this topic and

906
00:47:35,042 --> 00:47:36,716
we don't have to context switch in that

907
00:47:36,738 --> 00:47:39,532
way. On the other hand, you have noise,

908
00:47:39,596 --> 00:47:42,240
right? In one of those other situations,

909
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,928
I can't recall which one. I guess in

910
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:50,176
the reversed one, right. When a's QRF is

911
00:47:50,198 --> 00:47:52,416
larger than that of B, so it encompasses

912
00:47:52,448 --> 00:47:54,848
more of the boundary degrees of freedom,

913
00:47:55,024 --> 00:47:57,604
those that are not overlapping A

914
00:47:57,642 --> 00:47:59,604
perceives as noises. That's correct.

915
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:03,430
Right? Yeah. A will be looking at

916
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,568
B's thermal sector, b's free energy

917
00:48:08,654 --> 00:48:12,072
sector. Right. So A

918
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:15,192
may be interpreting, in a sense, what

919
00:48:15,246 --> 00:48:17,180
it's doing as informative,

920
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,012
and A may even be seeing what B is doing

921
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,340
as informative.

922
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,464
So noise for B may be signal for A,

923
00:48:30,662 --> 00:48:34,416
depending on how a's QRF is

924
00:48:34,438 --> 00:48:38,480
structured, but A

925
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:42,144
is seeing more information than B

926
00:48:42,182 --> 00:48:43,890
is trying to send it.

927
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,608
So it's it's essentially the the reverse

928
00:48:48,624 --> 00:48:52,390
of the hidden variable case. There are

929
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,210
variables in the other system

930
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,832
that aren't telling you anything about

931
00:48:59,886 --> 00:49:02,410
what the other system is actually doing.

932
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:08,760
That's very interesting in terms of

933
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,462
reading too much or too little between

934
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:13,542
the lines, connecting too many dots or

935
00:49:13,596 --> 00:49:15,862
connecting not enough dots. But these

936
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:19,314
challenges where noise for one quantum

937
00:49:19,362 --> 00:49:21,378
cognitive agent might be signal for

938
00:49:21,404 --> 00:49:23,866
another and vice versa, those are the

939
00:49:23,888 --> 00:49:25,098
challenges that we want to address.

940
00:49:25,184 --> 00:49:27,766
Because to have a physics that doesn't

941
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,338
recognize those situations is kind

942
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:33,374
of taking the view from nowhere or not

943
00:49:33,412 --> 00:49:36,366
really addressing the complexity of a

944
00:49:36,388 --> 00:49:37,950
cognitive engagement.

945
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:43,002
Yeah, it's describing interactions

946
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:45,806
between, effectively, systems that don't

947
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:47,330
share the same language.

948
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,050
I have a question about the free energy

949
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,298
principle here. Only in the

950
00:49:55,304 --> 00:49:58,482
last several years has the quantum

951
00:49:58,546 --> 00:50:01,782
free energy principle relationship come

952
00:50:01,836 --> 00:50:04,086
into light. So maybe could you just

953
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:06,054
share a little bit about what

954
00:50:06,172 --> 00:50:09,682
incremental or quantum advances

955
00:50:09,746 --> 00:50:12,406
enabled that to happen? Or what degrees

956
00:50:12,438 --> 00:50:16,362
of freedom were preexisting or

957
00:50:16,496 --> 00:50:20,710
added to enable work arising

958
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:23,194
from perception and action in neural

959
00:50:23,242 --> 00:50:28,158
systems to also so naturally enter

960
00:50:28,244 --> 00:50:29,754
this context with the quantum

961
00:50:29,802 --> 00:50:30,400
information?

962
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:36,260
Well, I think, at least from

963
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,660
historical point of view,

964
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,986
that connection was made based on the

965
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:46,306
analogy between a Markov blanket and a

966
00:50:46,328 --> 00:50:49,542
Holographic screen. So these are

967
00:50:49,596 --> 00:50:51,906
structures developed in different parts

968
00:50:51,938 --> 00:50:54,806
of physics that essentially serve the

969
00:50:54,828 --> 00:50:57,894
same function of limiting the

970
00:50:57,932 --> 00:51:00,074
information that one system can have

971
00:51:00,112 --> 00:51:05,302
about another system. So it's

972
00:51:05,366 --> 00:51:09,210
that functional analogy between

973
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,198
a Markov blanket defined classically and

974
00:51:13,284 --> 00:51:15,786
a Holographic screen defined in quantum

975
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:19,662
theory that made

976
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:23,434
it seem obvious that we could translate

977
00:51:23,482 --> 00:51:25,598
the free energy principle into a quantum

978
00:51:25,614 --> 00:51:26,930
theoretic principle.

979
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:38,306
Yes. In live stream 40, we talked a lot

980
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:41,266
about this, but I think that remains one

981
00:51:41,288 --> 00:51:45,058
of the most remarkable advances

982
00:51:45,234 --> 00:51:47,830
inside or outside the free energy

983
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,862
principle literature based

984
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:54,374
upon this functional acknowledgment of

985
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:57,418
boundaries and the conditions that they

986
00:51:57,504 --> 00:52:00,134
entail, which, again, are the challenges

987
00:52:00,182 --> 00:52:03,846
that we want to address lest we ignore

988
00:52:03,878 --> 00:52:06,986
boundaries. Right? Yeah, precisely. I

989
00:52:07,008 --> 00:52:08,506
mean, the free energy principle is all

990
00:52:08,528 --> 00:52:10,926
about what happens when you have a

991
00:52:10,948 --> 00:52:11,630
boundary.

992
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,230
The waste heat.

993
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:25,422
Is this the actual thermal

994
00:52:25,486 --> 00:52:29,586
exhaust from our CPU? Or how

995
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:33,300
can we think about the heat being

996
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:37,990
released topologically rather

997
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,074
than geometrically, like the location

998
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:43,254
where it's released? What does it mean

999
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:46,142
to consider physical processes

1000
00:52:46,226 --> 00:52:49,030
topologically that we might otherwise

1001
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:51,082
just use a geometric way of thinking

1002
00:52:51,136 --> 00:52:54,620
about? Well,

1003
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,386
you basically put your finger on it and

1004
00:52:57,408 --> 00:53:00,398
that you're not worried about the

1005
00:53:00,484 --> 00:53:04,974
spatial difference between the

1006
00:53:05,012 --> 00:53:07,360
geometric spatial difference between

1007
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:10,986
where one kind of information flows

1008
00:53:11,018 --> 00:53:12,242
through the boundary and where another

1009
00:53:12,296 --> 00:53:13,826
kind of information flows through the

1010
00:53:13,848 --> 00:53:17,346
boundary. And you can think

1011
00:53:17,368 --> 00:53:19,460
about this in Markov blanket terms.

1012
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,994
And the Markov blanket is just a

1013
00:53:23,032 --> 00:53:26,374
network. And some

1014
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:30,070
of the causal arrows flowing through

1015
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,210
that blanket network are effectively

1016
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:35,830
transmitting noise.

1017
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:42,634
And you can think in the same way with

1018
00:53:42,672 --> 00:53:45,386
respect to a holographic screen if

1019
00:53:45,408 --> 00:53:47,034
you're doing a certain amount of

1020
00:53:47,072 --> 00:53:49,082
information processing. And this this

1021
00:53:49,136 --> 00:53:52,934
brings up the whole issue of how

1022
00:53:53,072 --> 00:53:57,360
how efficient is a system in

1023
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,466
its information processing? How close is

1024
00:54:01,508 --> 00:54:04,340
it to the land hour limit? Basically?

1025
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:12,100
Can it extract more

1026
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:17,566
energy from some bits than

1027
00:54:17,608 --> 00:54:21,590
it has to use to modify the states

1028
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:26,440
of other bits? That's what this,

1029
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,466
if you will, metabolic question is all

1030
00:54:29,488 --> 00:54:33,782
about. In the case of an organism,

1031
00:54:33,846 --> 00:54:37,914
is it can I get more energy from some

1032
00:54:37,952 --> 00:54:40,540
of the chemistry that I have access to

1033
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:44,974
than I need to use to modify the

1034
00:54:45,012 --> 00:54:47,150
chemistry that I need to modify?

1035
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:51,622
And if not, then life stops.

1036
00:54:51,786 --> 00:54:53,650
Everything grinds to a halt.

1037
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,750
Now, can the heat exhaust

1038
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,710
informationally be useful for another

1039
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,622
agent somehow? I mean, can't we recover

1040
00:55:11,686 --> 00:55:14,954
heat in a steam engine and use it to do

1041
00:55:14,992 --> 00:55:17,626
useful work? Not to the point of a

1042
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,514
perpetual motion machine, but how can we

1043
00:55:19,552 --> 00:55:22,526
recover exhaust? And then what does the

1044
00:55:22,548 --> 00:55:24,640
perpetual motion machine look like?

1045
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:29,870
Well, the environment is the system

1046
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,438
sitting over on the other side of the

1047
00:55:31,444 --> 00:55:36,930
boundary that is absorbing

1048
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:39,826
whatever waste heat is generated by the

1049
00:55:39,848 --> 00:55:43,490
system. Let's call it Alice

1050
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:47,538
that we're interested in. So that

1051
00:55:47,624 --> 00:55:52,834
environment may be alice

1052
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,442
can't tell this, but it may be divided

1053
00:55:55,506 --> 00:55:58,790
up into lots of different compartments,

1054
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:02,794
some of which are basically sucking in

1055
00:56:02,832 --> 00:56:05,850
Alice's waste heat and doing something

1056
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,514
with it. So this

1057
00:56:09,552 --> 00:56:13,214
is really a question about how is the

1058
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:17,326
environment structured and

1059
00:56:17,508 --> 00:56:22,058
what operations does the environment

1060
00:56:22,154 --> 00:56:25,586
execute with the input that

1061
00:56:25,608 --> 00:56:27,634
it gets? How does it interpret that

1062
00:56:27,672 --> 00:56:28,450
input?

1063
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,430
And what would.

1064
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,150
This gets back to this question about

1065
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,408
how do we talk about multiple agents

1066
00:56:42,494 --> 00:56:44,490
that are communicating with each other

1067
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:49,770
instead of talking about an

1068
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,264
environment that we don't characterize

1069
00:56:52,312 --> 00:56:55,676
at all? How do

1070
00:56:55,698 --> 00:56:58,220
we talk about an environment that

1071
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:02,392
includes some specified or preferred

1072
00:57:02,456 --> 00:57:05,600
systems that are treated as

1073
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:07,730
or known to be other agents?

1074
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,880
Let me get back to your question about

1075
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,336
perpetual motion machine. Notice that in

1076
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:19,044
classical thermodynamics there's always

1077
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:21,156
the assumption that there's a big

1078
00:57:21,258 --> 00:57:24,628
environment out there the rest of

1079
00:57:24,634 --> 00:57:26,612
the universe or whatever, the whole

1080
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:31,144
environment that's not on Earth. That is

1081
00:57:31,342 --> 00:57:37,444
an arbitrarily large source

1082
00:57:37,492 --> 00:57:40,472
of or it's not an arbitrarily large

1083
00:57:40,526 --> 00:57:42,324
source of free energy, but it's a large

1084
00:57:42,382 --> 00:57:45,580
source of free energy. And it's a large

1085
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:48,232
sink for entropy, a kind of arbitrarily

1086
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:51,484
large sink for entropy. So the second

1087
00:57:51,522 --> 00:57:53,496
law of thermodynamics says the entropy

1088
00:57:53,528 --> 00:57:57,440
of this entire system counting

1089
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,132
the whole surrounding environment

1090
00:58:01,196 --> 00:58:05,104
doesn't decrease, so it

1091
00:58:05,142 --> 00:58:08,436
can increase and still satisfy the

1092
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:10,804
second law. So this gives you the

1093
00:58:10,842 --> 00:58:13,984
classical 19th century heat

1094
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,750
death of the Universe idea.

1095
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,480
And so your proposed machine

1096
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,232
is sitting somewhere embedded in

1097
00:58:26,286 --> 00:58:30,200
this gigantic environment that

1098
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:33,132
can provide some finite amount of free

1099
00:58:33,186 --> 00:58:35,724
energy but can exhaust effectively an

1100
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,820
arbitrary amount of entropy.

1101
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,512
So any machine has to dissipate

1102
00:58:43,576 --> 00:58:47,410
entropy as it runs to fill up this

1103
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:52,124
kind of arbitrary sink

1104
00:58:52,172 --> 00:58:54,336
of entropy that's the classical rest of

1105
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:56,556
the Universe. Now, compare that to the

1106
00:58:56,598 --> 00:58:59,296
picture in Quantum theory. The picture

1107
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:01,444
in Quantum theory is the Universe, by

1108
00:59:01,482 --> 00:59:03,670
definition, is an isolated system.

1109
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,116
So its total information content

1110
00:59:08,218 --> 00:59:11,480
doesn't change, right?

1111
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:15,188
It's evolving. unitarily unitary

1112
00:59:15,284 --> 00:59:18,056
operations preserve information, so

1113
00:59:18,078 --> 00:59:20,170
they're just moving information around.

1114
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,796
So from

1115
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:28,910
the point of view of any local system,

1116
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,764
the local system is getting information

1117
00:59:32,882 --> 00:59:35,024
from its environment, so it sees its

1118
00:59:35,062 --> 00:59:37,424
environment losing information, so

1119
00:59:37,462 --> 00:59:38,800
gaining entropy.

1120
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:45,024
What this tells us is that entropy is,

1121
00:59:45,062 --> 00:59:49,604
in fact, not a

1122
00:59:49,642 --> 00:59:52,400
globally definable quantity.

1123
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,724
Entropy is always defined relative to

1124
00:59:54,762 --> 00:59:57,364
some observer, some division, some

1125
00:59:57,402 --> 01:00:01,224
boundary. And this

1126
01:00:01,262 --> 01:00:05,336
is another kind of big change in

1127
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:08,090
the last few decades and has led to,

1128
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,224
for example, entropic definitions of

1129
01:00:11,262 --> 01:00:15,032
time. My local external

1130
01:00:15,096 --> 01:00:18,956
time arrow is whatever

1131
01:00:19,058 --> 01:00:21,996
direction I see entropy increasing the

1132
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:22,590
most.

1133
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:31,062
So, again, I would refer to people like

1134
01:00:31,116 --> 01:00:34,434
Rovelli and Max Taymar,

1135
01:00:34,482 --> 01:00:37,110
who developed many of these ideas.

1136
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:43,340
Awesome. All right,

1137
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:47,882
thank you, Chris, and Aguirre looking

1138
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:50,218
forward to seeing everyone's questions

1139
01:00:50,384 --> 01:00:53,898
submitted and their preparation and

1140
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:56,930
participation and measurement in the

1141
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,686
discussion section. So thank you. Till

1142
01:01:00,718 --> 01:01:02,322
next time. All right. Thanks again,

1143
01:01:02,376 --> 01:01:05,346
Daniel. Thank you. Aguirre we'll see you

1144
01:01:05,368 --> 01:01:05,938
later.
