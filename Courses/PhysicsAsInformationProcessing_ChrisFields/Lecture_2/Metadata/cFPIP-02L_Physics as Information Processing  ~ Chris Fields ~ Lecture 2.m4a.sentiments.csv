5520	6070	A	0.546256959438324	You.
7800	8870	B	0.5148600339889526	Hello, everyone.
9320	12148	B	0.853792667388916	It's June 15, 2023.
12314	19280	B	0.8860012292861938	We are here in lecture two of Chris field's course, physics as Information Processing.
19360	19700	B	0.617027759552002	So.
19770	21040	B	0.8918594717979431	Thank you, Chris.
21200	23460	B	0.9814717769622803	Looking forward to the lecture.
25240	26660	A	0.8880262970924377	Thank you, Daniel.
27160	29380	A	0.92293381690979	And, yes, welcome to this session.
29840	30492	A	0.6652049422264099	How?
30626	34300	A	0.8879523277282715	This section is titled why Quantum Physics.
35440	54560	A	0.9169792532920837	And if you will recall, from the first session, we reviewed the history of physics and some of the history of mathematics and computer science from the end of the 19th century through to the beginning of the 21st century.
55400	90808	A	0.8769388794898987	And discuss the slow development from classical thermodynamics of quantum information theory and specifically characterizing quantum information theory as a new kind of physics that describes systems that are exchanging finite amounts of discretely encoded information across some intervening boundary.
90984	112928	A	0.9062649607658386	And so we use this very conventional graphical notation of two agents or physical systems, alice and Bob, A and B, that are exchanging energy and information across some boundary.
113104	120680	A	0.9017043709754944	And I always use a blue ellipse like this to indicate the boundary that separates Alice from Bob.
121500	128884	A	0.6503196954727173	And this new approach to physics is entirely topological.
129012	130840	A	0.6212857961654663	It's not geometric.
131360	140620	A	0.8390730619430542	So it doesn't assume a particular background spacetime, so it doesn't assume that Alice and Bob are spatially separated.
141920	159844	A	0.7653082609176636	And so this makes it a very different kind of theory from classical information theory in that the channel that separates Alice from Bob, this boundary is a boundary in state space.
160042	164612	A	0.7352916598320007	It's not a boundary in some geometric embedding space.
164666	173880	A	0.7797121405601501	And in particular, it's not a boundary or a channel that's embedded in a three dimensional space that separates Alice from Bob.
175500	194770	A	0.6243408918380737	So that's what we talked about last time and today what I want to discuss is how quantum theory in particular makes this idea of physics as a theory of communication simple and obvious.
196260	211590	A	0.8893172144889832	And quantum theory, of course, has a terrible reputation of being abstruse and mathematically incredibly complicated and counterintuitive and difficult to understand.
212520	224490	A	0.5841487646102905	And this is one quotation among many from leading physicists pointing out that quantum mechanics is just difficult.
225900	239580	A	0.7493088245391846	And as you probably know, there's an entire philosophical industry of interpretations of quantum theory that try to make sense of its ontology.
242900	248720	A	0.8423274159431458	What I don't want to do today is try to introduce quantum mechanics.
250340	253730	A	0.7398996353149414	We're not doing any of this.
254740	264660	A	0.7795202732086182	Some of you will recognize this as the table of contents, the first part of the table of contents of the famous textbook by Landau and Lifts.
265080	266004	A	0.6879944801330566	How that?
266042	275930	A	0.7701596617698669	If you've studied quantum theory in undergraduate or graduate school, you've probably dealt with a textbook structured much like this one.
276300	294530	A	0.8665401935577393	And you've probably been introduced to quantum mechanics as it was traditionally conceived as essentially a mechanical theory, a theory of motion with wave functions and particle representations and on and on and on.
294980	297264	A	0.5306771993637085	So we're not going to try to do that.
297382	318810	A	0.7786051630973816	This what we're going to do instead is take a completely information theoretic approach, and we're going to characterize information transfer in a quantum theoretic way without any assumptions about mechanics or spacetime or any of that.
319500	323770	A	0.6717910170555115	So instead of this, we're going to ask a simple question.
325580	331788	A	0.7754552364349365	By a simple question, I mean a question with just a yes no answer or a binary answer.
331874	336670	A	0.8578714728355408	So let's use up or down as our example question.
338160	341070	A	0.8096334934234619	And to ask this question, we need three things.
342340	343932	A	0.726241409778595	First, we need an action.
343996	346290	A	0.765351414680481	We need a way of asking it.
347860	351730	A	0.8656534552574158	For example, making a sound or writing something down.
353860	359030	A	0.8380813598632812	Second, we need a thing that we can ask the question of.
360040	373930	A	0.8715159893035889	We need an environment or a friend or the rest of the world or an experimental apparatus or some system or other that we're going to act on to ask this question.
375100	381100	A	0.8608109354972839	And the third thing that we need to ask this question is a shared language.
381520	389100	A	0.5343565940856934	And it's the shared language that's often neglected in models based in physics.
390880	396300	A	0.5760970711708069	And I think the importance of the shared language became clear in classical information theory.
396460	400572	A	0.7775845527648926	And it's become clear again, of course, in quantum information theory.
400716	404080	A	0.5396387577056885	But this has only happened over the last few decades.
404840	418664	A	0.7573422789573669	So what I want to do today is to construct in a step by step fashion a formal representation of these three things that we need to ask a simple question.
418862	424628	A	0.826155424118042	And what we'll find is that that formal representation is in fact quantum theory.
424724	435436	A	0.8267251253128052	So it's quantum theory that provides us with a formal representation of asking these simple binary questions.
435618	441950	A	0.7837070226669312	And of course, if you can ask a binary question, you can ask any finite number of binary questions.
442420	455670	A	0.7926921248435974	So you can construct an Arbitrarily complex finite decision tree that ends up formulating an Arbitrarily complex but still finite question.
456040	462870	A	0.8479394912719727	So this really is a general model of communicative interactions between agents.
465240	472104	A	0.8920767307281494	So let's go about this and talk first about the action of asking you a question.
472222	488030	A	0.7953290343284607	And so the first thing I want you to do is actually say out loud up or down, actually ask a question and then note two things about what just happened.
489440	493856	A	0.6796829700469971	The first thing to note is that it took some time to do that.
494038	503970	A	0.7417422533035278	That action actually required a finite amount of time, a couple of seconds, not very long, but it's not zero.
504740	507590	A	0.7654340863227844	It always takes time to ask a question.
508440	514870	A	0.6836752891540527	And the second thing to note is that it took energy to actually say up or down.
515400	520650	A	0.8012968301773071	It requires a little bit of exertion to ask a question.
521660	526920	A	0.853359043598175	So let's put those two together and define a word.
526990	533596	A	0.8694044351577759	We're going to define the word action to mean some energy that's spent in some time.
533778	544944	A	0.7710990905761719	So asking a question is an action and it qualifies as an action because it requires spending some energy in some finite amount of time.
545142	549170	A	0.8694521188735962	And so we can write this as action equals energy times time.
549540	553730	A	0.8629359602928162	Or I'll sometimes use the abbreviation E times T.
556100	571736	A	0.8712234497070312	And action is always required when there's some interaction or two way action between systems.
571848	583330	A	0.7566648721694946	So whenever we talk about physical interaction, we're always talking about two systems doing something to each other that requires both energy and time.
584980	588220	A	0.8399043679237366	So let's define another concept.
588300	595750	A	0.852886438369751	A concept of a minimum action needed to ask a question, and specifically a question with a binary answer.
597000	601696	A	0.8379409909248352	And we'll just pick a symbol to stand for that minimum action.
601888	605590	A	0.856829047203064	And the symbol we'll use because it's conventional is h.
606200	629260	A	0.7514732480049133	And it turns out that this h is planck's constant, the number that planck came up with when he was trying to solve the black body problem back in 1900 that we talked about last time and recall, that was the problem of characterizing, the spectrum of radiation emitted by some physical system.
629330	630430	A	0.873131275177002	That was hot.
630800	633920	A	0.8606853485107422	How much energy comes out as a function of temperature.
634660	642304	A	0.7417696714401245	And if you assume that the spectrum of energy coming out is continuous, you get predictions that are wrong.
642502	658824	A	0.676167368888855	And Planck got predictions that were correct by assuming that that spectrum was discrete and that this h represented the minimum amount of energy that could be emitted in a particular time.
658942	663400	A	0.859589695930481	So it represented the minimum energy times time or action.
663980	666490	A	0.8813419938087463	So let's look at an example of that.
667500	669976	A	0.7561047673225403	And here's an example that may be familiar.
670088	673310	A	0.8375241160392761	It's the example of your own visual system.
674640	695750	A	0.7907820343971252	So in the retinal, the cells of your retinas, there are many, many molecules that are rodoxins of one variety or other that respond to different wavelengths of visible light, and they have some efficiency for capturing light.
696280	703430	A	0.6528702974319458	And let's just assume that they're optimally efficient, that they're as efficient as they could possibly be.
704200	727372	A	0.8293821215629578	And that means that they require the minimum amount of energy to change shape, which is what they do when they're impacted by Light to capture the energy and hence the information that's available in the Light and the minimum energy to do anything that records one bit of information.
727506	728796	A	0.8315914273262024	So yes or no?
728898	732112	A	0.8290377855300903	Up or down is 0.7.
732166	739760	A	0.8861036896705627	So log two of Boltzman's constant times the temperature.
741060	744370	A	0.5555346608161926	And again, we saw this last time.
745080	760340	A	0.9182680249214172	This is from roughly 1875 and was then built into classical information theory by Shannon and then by Landauer in the mid 20th century.
760680	769720	A	0.659498393535614	So what we're doing is assuming that since rudopsin is optimally efficient, all it requires is this amount of energy to change shape.
770300	775944	A	0.8985994458198547	And it's known experimentally, that rhodopsin takes about 200 femtoseconds to change shape.
775992	779436	A	0.8132209181785583	So that's 200 times ten to the -15.
779538	780392	A	0.6587877869606018	Seconds.
780536	784320	A	0.6516287922859192	So it's a very very fast reaction, chemical reaction.
785140	807910	A	0.8152916431427002	So we can just calculate what the action is and at 37 degrees centigrade so human body temperature KT is about 4.3 times ten to the -21 Joule and Joule is just a standard unit of energy and so we can multiply everything together.
809800	811992	A	0.6820338368415833	KT times zero seven times.
812046	825260	A	0.8699357509613037	This response time of 200 femtoseconds multiplied together gives you an action of about six times ten to the -34 joule seconds.
825840	836604	A	0.5584854483604431	And if you're familiar with quantum mechanics, you'll instantly recognize that number because it's very close to the value of Planck's Constant, which is 6.6 times.
836642	837792	A	0.7890893220901489	Ten to the -34.
837846	838780	A	0.675298810005188	Joule seconds.
838860	842720	A	0.791465163230896	So this says that Rhodopsin is very near to optimal.
845480	850736	A	0.5159047245979309	The best it would be able to do would be Planck's constant.
850848	854180	A	0.7279834747314453	That's the minimum action that can be undertaken.
855720	859290	A	0.9271992444992065	So Rodobson is clearly doing very well.
860220	868840	A	0.47419488430023193	It can't be as efficient as we're assuming it to be, but it's pretty efficient.
869180	877868	A	0.7379776239395142	So this number Planck's constant is and this idea of a minimum action is not something we just pulled out of the air.
878034	880216	A	0.7792981266975403	It's something that one can observe.
880328	888290	A	0.9003971815109253	When you're looking at what real biological systems in particular do and other physical systems do.
889860	897380	A	0.8830262422561646	So let's think about the second component of this project of asking a question.
897450	899830	A	0.7793677449226379	And that's the thing to be asked.
900840	903348	A	0.8472756147384644	And we want to ask a very simple question.
903434	906870	A	0.7452972531318665	We want to have a theory of asking very simple questions.
907340	915290	A	0.8255642056465149	So let's define the simplest thing that we can ask a binary question to.
915660	923484	A	0.8365867137908936	And let's say this is the thing that we can ask a binary question of using just this minimum action h.
923682	930030	A	0.8537802696228027	So we're going to ask for the minimal thing that it's possible physically to ask a question of.
930560	934160	A	0.7100489735603333	And this thing needs a name, so let's call it a qubit.
934740	938210	A	0.6583952307701111	And that word is a contraction of Quantum bit.
939300	940832	A	0.7909872531890869	And we can draw it like this.
940886	943104	A	0.7726417779922485	A little sphere with an arrow through it.
943222	945380	A	0.8552903532981873	That's called a block sphere.
946040	947504	A	0.7592960000038147	And we use a symbol.
947552	948244	A	0.5743283629417419	Q.
948442	957556	A	0.8607829809188843	And that notation with the bar and the angle bracket is called a bra notation.
957668	960228	A	0.7820754051208496	And it originates with Durac.
960404	972350	A	0.9114840030670166	So it's a traditional way of writing inner products, actually, in quantum theory to indicate the state of Q.
973360	980556	A	0.55572110414505	So this thing called a qubit only responds to binary questions.
980738	983776	A	0.7373940944671631	So it clearly can have only two states.
983878	987410	A	0.7303454279899597	The state that answers yes and the state that answers no.
987860	989440	A	0.7739686369895935	And conventionally.
989780	993344	A	0.7073289155960083	We draw the arrow going up if the answer is yes.
993382	996308	A	0.5806613564491272	And the arrow going down if the answer is no.
996474	1003350	A	0.8674655556678772	And so those are the two states that the qubit can be in when it's answered a question.
1004520	1011480	A	0.9006500840187073	So now let's draw a picture for the act of asking a question of q in the state.
1011550	1011832	A	0.5743283629417419	Q.
1011886	1013530	A	0.7724740505218506	And let's draw it like this.
1015180	1021596	A	0.8665024042129517	This curvy arrow is the action of asking the question and getting the answer back.
1021778	1025740	A	0.7400450706481934	And we're asking it of this minimum system, the qubit.
1026240	1038080	A	0.8683690428733826	And let's call this entire act of h and write h acting on Q by this expression HQ.
1038660	1048660	A	0.6282619833946228	So again, we're developing the notation of quantum theory, which all of you who know the theory already will find familiar.
1050680	1058360	A	0.8355103135108948	So the third thing that we have to build into this picture and into the theory is the shared language.
1059740	1068810	A	0.7898556590080261	So we have to know what we mean by up or down if we're going to ask the question up or down?
1070000	1080110	A	0.848901093006134	And we have to have some representation of what it means for the qubit to distinguish up or down.
1080560	1094560	A	0.8250189423561096	So let's say that to us, up and down mean this little diagram with an arrow that's labeled up on one end and down on the other end.
1094710	1100048	A	0.4971279203891754	So we're defining up and down in a very simple way as just opposites.
1100144	1103888	A	0.6202775835990906	We don't know anything else about them except that they're opposites.
1104064	1107412	A	0.6641516089439392	So this is a stripped down one bit question.
1107546	1110296	A	0.7921556830406189	We could have called them one and minus one.
1110478	1112312	A	0.8180778622627258	We could have called them A and B.
1112366	1113930	A	0.7651529908180237	We could have called them anything.
1114860	1120460	A	0.5685024261474609	We're just indicating that up and down are two opposing concepts.
1121200	1133760	A	0.869634747505188	And so this object that we've used to make this definition of the relationship between our two words up and down is called a reference frame.
1135220	1143120	A	0.7935663461685181	It's a physical object that encodes a concept or a meaning.
1144120	1165160	A	0.4817834794521332	And if you think about using language, using English, for example, you can understand me speaking in English because your brain has the right sorts of neural circuits to allow you to understand English and produce English using your hand in your mouth.
1165820	1174616	A	0.8455542325973511	And those neural circuits are reference frames in your brain for understanding and producing English.
1174728	1178270	A	0.7203551530838013	And they encode the relationships between different words.
1179600	1183040	A	0.8815248608589172	So you all know about Chat GPT.
1183540	1201940	A	0.8983576893806458	You can think of all of the weights on all of the ten to the 19th or however many parameters there are in GPT four as a reference frame that describes the relationships between words and phrases in English and many other languages.
1202280	1214452	A	0.8511538505554199	So this idea of a reference frame is an instance of Landauer's principle, which is often summarized as saying that information is physical.
1214596	1228700	A	0.8521978855133057	What that means is that information always has to have some encoding and that encoding, that object can always be thought of as a reference frame.
1229840	1231950	A	0.7206544280052185	So let's put all this stuff together.
1234100	1240208	A	0.867046058177948	What we have now is a reference frame that defines the difference between up and down.
1240374	1251110	A	0.9013386964797974	We have an action that we've labeled H, and the action acts on this object, the qubit, which is in some state.
1252520	1256900	A	0.7924745678901672	And what we've drawn here now is an experiment.
1257660	1268324	A	0.8932811617851257	And you can think of the incoming part of the arrow that goes from the reference frame to the qubit as a preparation of the qubit.
1268452	1280590	A	0.8578186631202698	So you can think of it as I'm doing something to the qubit to put it in a particular state like up, because that's the state I want it to be in.
1281680	1290930	A	0.8979637622833252	And I can think of this returning part of the arrow as a measurement of the state that the qubit is actually in.
1291460	1302930	A	0.9064475297927856	So if the qubit is actually in this state with the arrow pointing up, then I'm going to get back the answer up when I act on the qubit to measure its state.
1304420	1328556	A	0.8527781367301941	So now we can recognize this action, H as the Hamiltonian operator in quantum theory, which always takes some time, which we represent by an interval DT, to act on some state, and in particular this binary state, Q.
1328738	1335360	A	0.8717851638793945	So this whole picture depicts the action of a very simple Hamiltonian operator.
1337380	1346070	A	0.7142064571380615	And again, I want to emphasize that we've just defined the qubit as the simplest thing that we can ask a binary question of.
1348920	1351110	A	0.7436110377311707	So how does this H work?
1352840	1361450	A	0.9136788845062256	We can use H to prepare this qubit in one of two states, which we're going to label one and minus one.
1362140	1375292	A	0.853437066078186	The state one corresponds to the up direction, and the state minus one corresponds to the down direction, and doing this to Q.
1375426	1382288	A	0.8420791625976562	So preparing Q in one of these two states takes energy, and we know how much.
1382454	1394556	A	0.8323522806167603	Boltzman told us back in 1875 that the minimum energy to reduce the entropy of the universe by one bit is log two of KT.
1394748	1398720	A	0.8865606784820557	We saw that earlier when we were thinking about Rhodobson.
1399240	1409864	A	0.8189270496368408	So we can say that acting with H always requires some number times KT, where that number is bigger than the log of two.
1409982	1431612	A	0.8364796042442322	Remember, the log of two is just in there to get units of bits of binary questions, as opposed to units of nats, which are questions that have e answers, where E is the exponential base, the natural exponential base.
1431746	1437010	A	0.855191707611084	But we want to use units of bits, so we have to always have this factor of log two.
1438500	1442480	A	0.8625247478485107	So this lets us write H in a particular way.
1442550	1452900	A	0.7827832102775574	We can take out this energetic term that Boltzman tells us we have to include beta times KT.
1454040	1462868	A	0.8712027072906494	And what's left over is, in a sense, the pure representation of the action, stripping out the energy requirement.
1463044	1472380	A	0.8562185764312744	And we're going to call that M, because M is the standard symbol to use in quantum theory for a measurement operator.
1473520	1476552	A	0.6144594550132751	And M is now dimensionless.
1476696	1487712	A	0.7425050139427185	H has units of energy, KT is an energy, and M has no units at all.
1487846	1490290	A	0.5239946842193604	So it's H without the energy.
1491300	1505220	A	0.8134769201278687	So now we can ask, what is this operator M that we've defined as the simplest possible action on a qubit, but abstracting away the amount of energy that we have to use to act on the qubit.
1506200	1512490	A	0.8182701468467712	Well, what M does is just encode a bit or decode a bit.
1513740	1520760	A	0.8842766284942627	So we can use this operator M to say, I want Q to have the value one.
1520910	1530030	A	0.8075476288795471	I want it to be up, so I can sort of reach out with my operator M and grab Q and turn it so that its arrow is pointing up.
1531600	1534332	A	0.6132495403289795	And that's the operation.
1534396	1536284	A	0.8600772619247437	That's called preparation in physics.
1536332	1539644	A	0.8447548151016235	It's what it means to prepare an experimental apparatus.
1539692	1548070	A	0.9059577584266663	For example, you actually grab hold of the apparatus, and you twist some knobs and flick some switches to prepare it to be in some state.
1549320	1554160	A	0.8240416646003723	And you can use M to measure a state that isn't known.
1554320	1565290	A	0.9134740233421326	So I can use M to grab a hold of Q and look at it and determine whether it's in state one or minus one.
1566140	1574940	A	0.8774139285087585	And I can represent these as just a cycle that starts with measuring and then prepares, or that starts with preparing and then measuring.
1575840	1589052	A	0.8739936947822571	And if I represent it that way, what I see is M having a value which is either the value I want to encode or the value that I have measured.
1589196	1603510	A	0.896111786365509	And Q and M acts on that value and Q to produce a particular state of Q, to put Q in a particular state, or to realize that Q is in that state.
1604840	1613000	A	0.8765425682067871	And so M is actually an identity acting on some value and Q.
1613150	1624664	A	0.8616588115692139	So it maps one in Q to one in Q, and it maps minus one in Q to minus one in Q if you do the whole cycle of preparation and then measurement.
1624792	1625852	A	0.4946954548358917	And that makes sense.
1625906	1639024	A	0.8898751139640808	It's actually an axiom in some formulations of quantum theory that if I measure the state of some object, what I'm doing is also preparing it in that state.
1639142	1643010	A	0.7126256823539734	So if I immediately measure it again, I'll see the same value.
1644580	1646512	A	0.4935349225997925	And that makes sense physically.
1646576	1655540	A	0.8585200309753418	If I put my coffee cup on the table and then I look for it, it's likely going to be on the table unless something else intervenes.
1656200	1657464	A	0.7598902583122253	Well, what does this mean?
1657502	1660280	A	0.5289684534072876	It means that we can do a little bit of algebra.
1662860	1680670	A	0.769719660282135	It means that we can write this original expression of acting on Q with our Hamiltonian in this somewhat more explicit form of using the energy beta KT and our operator M on Q.
1681540	1687890	A	0.8532034158706665	And what I get out of that is the energy beta KT multiplied by Q.
1690020	1693360	A	0.7897849678993225	So HQ equals EQ.
1694200	1696180	A	0.8295080065727234	That's the Schrodinger equation.
1696520	1700016	A	0.8445209264755249	So that's one of the central equations of quantum theory.
1700208	1707450	A	0.8619721531867981	What it says is that this operator, H, is the total energy operator on a system.
1707980	1712344	A	0.8003080487251282	Its eigenvalues are the total energies of the system.
1712542	1723576	A	0.7583325505256653	And we can now see where that energy is coming from in this very, very simple, stripped down kind of representation of an action.
1723768	1732930	A	0.8101053237915039	The energy is the thermodynamic energy that has to be spent to determine one binary outcome up or down.
1734900	1746500	A	0.8654885292053223	Now, if you're familiar with quantum mechanics, you will have seen exponentiated operators like the next line here of algebra.
1748120	1762420	A	0.8762990236282349	This operator P, which is time dependent and which is the exponential of H multiplied by it over H bar, is called the propagator.
1762500	1770190	A	0.7700998187065125	It's the unitary operator in quantum theory, the operator that conserves probability or conserves information.
1772080	1785730	A	0.8730686902999878	And so, using the representation of H as beta KT, we can see that this operator P is just E to the minus beta M.
1787460	1803540	A	0.7972109913825989	If we recall the WIC rotation from the first session, this strange equivalence of it over H bar with one over KT that wasn't discovered until 50 years after the invention of quantum theory.
1805000	1809960	A	0.7238414883613586	And it's still a very debated thing.
1810030	1813850	A	0.5105687975883484	I mean, people worry about what this equation really means.
1814540	1836690	A	0.7761223912239075	But one thing that it means in this setting where H has this particularly simple form is that the propagator is now just the exponential of a number multiplied by this very simple strip down operator that encodes a bit or decodes a bit.
1838020	1842480	A	0.8577010631561279	But we know something about the exponential propagator just by looking at its form.
1842630	1848740	A	0.8703901767730713	If you're again familiar with these sorts of exponential operators, you know that they're wave equations.
1849720	1854608	A	0.8173184990882874	And we can make sense of that using the diagram up above.
1854784	1859160	A	0.7558680176734924	What M is doing is just performing a cycle.
1860220	1867850	A	0.8651224374771118	It's just mapping one and Q back to itself, or minus one and Q back to itself.
1868620	1884290	A	0.8939153552055359	So we can think of M as just taking this object and flipping it back around until it gets itself again.
1885860	1894608	A	0.8434486389160156	And that kind of cycle can always be turned into a wave equation and e to the I over H bar times.
1894694	1903524	A	0.8857629895210266	HT is a canonical form of a wave equation, where the horizontal axis here on the wave is time.
1903722	1917370	A	0.8494945764541626	Or if you look at the little cycle that I've drawn as a circle with an arrow, it's the time of the thing spinning around like this, which is exactly the same thing as a wave traveling through time.
1918540	1921070	A	0.5818413496017456	So that tells us something very important.
1922240	1929340	A	0.9006466269493103	It tells us that this equivalent expression, e to the minus beta M, is also a wave equation.
1929920	1937170	A	0.8439921140670776	So it tells us that this operator M has built into it some sense of time.
1939540	1943760	A	0.8602635264396667	It's the sense of time of this prepare measure cycle.
1944820	1948112	A	0.7592752575874329	And that's implicit in m right.
1948166	1958170	A	0.8585926294326782	We've used the WIC rotation to get rid of what I'll end up calling the external time t, the objective time T.
1959340	1971420	A	0.9211219549179077	And we'll see in July where this internal time comes from in terms of the WIC rotation.
1972160	1977948	A	0.8461791276931763	But we can say now that it's an agent specific time.
1978114	1992770	A	0.8790996670722961	It's an internal time reference frame that's built into our idea of this system, Alice, that can act on the world, and it represents the time that's required to ask this question.
1994280	1997716	C	0.8594004511833191	Okay, can I ask a question at this point?
1997898	1998630	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
1999240	2004260	C	0.8810670971870422	So on this slide with the operator M, I'm curious.
2004600	2011240	C	0.6838585138320923	How can the agent deploy in the operator M tell the difference or break the symmetry between preparation and measurement?
2012060	2015000	C	0.8339369893074036	Or are they just completely dual pictures?
2016060	2017572	A	0.7369080781936646	Yeah, they're completely dual.
2017636	2021720	A	0.7574622631072998	So the agent never breaks the symmetry.
2021800	2027340	A	0.5158448815345764	The agent can't actually distinguish the act of preparing from the act of measuring.
2028640	2032988	A	0.759964108467102	Every preparation is a measurement, and every measurement is a preparation.
2033164	2033890	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2034340	2046310	A	0.8605523109436035	That's, in fact, what this axiom of unitarity measuring a state leaves the particle in the measured state means.
2046760	2047510	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2049800	2052180	A	0.8242389559745789	So, yeah, mathematically, they're duals.
2053320	2054230	C	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
2057420	2064360	A	0.8893458247184753	Okay, so let's now use this theory that we've developed to describe the interaction between Alice and Bob.
2064940	2079150	A	0.8859339952468872	And let's think of a situation in which Alice prepares a qubit that Bob then measures, and then Bob prepares the very same qubit, and then Alice measures it.
2079680	2090720	A	0.9312945604324341	So Alice acts with her Hamiltonian operator, which we'll label Ha, and Bob acts with his Hamiltonian operator that we label HB.
2092020	2097030	A	0.8703143000602722	And let's say that Alice prepares the qubit as in state up.
2097800	2104870	A	0.8323096632957458	And Bob can then measure the qubit in state up and say, oh, the qubit is now up.
2105720	2117368	A	0.8489129543304443	And if Bob then prepares the qubit in state down, alice can measure the qubit in state down and say, oh, the qubit switched from the up that I prepared to down.
2117454	2119950	A	0.7461739182472229	So Bob must have prepared it as down.
2120880	2122590	A	0.8004997372627258	So what's happened here?
2123920	2128700	A	0.7073357701301575	Alice and Bob have actually shared a bit flip.
2130480	2137650	A	0.7971950769424438	Alice said up and Bob said, down, and Alice heard him say down.
2138100	2143890	A	0.6646873354911804	So they've shared this idea of change by interacting with each other.
2144680	2149510	A	0.6884015202522278	Now, this works as long as they mean the same thing by up and down.
2150040	2160730	A	0.7390887141227722	So we've implicitly assumed, in talking about them communicating, that they both have this reference frame that distinguishes up from down.
2162220	2170876	A	0.7868370413780212	And this is actually a completely general model of what I'll call a noiseless one qubit channel.
2171058	2172636	A	0.7316036224365234	Now, what does that mean?
2172818	2177692	A	0.4823622703552246	It's noiseless because there's nothing else in the picture, right?
2177746	2183112	A	0.5758842825889587	There's nothing in the picture that can jiggle the qubit when Alice and Bob aren't looking.
2183186	2190604	A	0.7316941618919373	Alice and Bob are the only systems we're talking about, and they share this qubit and there's nothing else in the picture.
2190652	2202944	A	0.6805840730667114	So there's no kind of third party or environment or heat bath or anything like that that's going to mess with the qubit and disrupt their interaction.
2203072	2215210	A	0.8779648542404175	So that's a noiseless channel and it's a one qubit channel because they just have one qubit that they're interacting with and they're alternately preparing and measuring its state.
2216620	2223100	A	0.7672964334487915	Now, clearly, if they can interact using one qubit, they can interact using any finite number of qubits.
2223760	2236240	A	0.8939065933227539	So here's a picture of an in qubit channel that Alice and Bob, which here I've labeled A and B because I took this figure from a paper, are sharing.
2236900	2245330	A	0.9084057211875916	And Alice and Bob both have N operators, one for each of the N qubits that they share.
2245700	2250192	A	0.8641138076782227	And they just do this prepared measurement cycle on all N qubits.
2250256	2264180	A	0.8645633459091187	So you can think of Alice preparing the N qubits, bob measuring the N qubits, and then Bob preparing and Alice measuring, and that allows them to exchange N bit messages.
2264340	2267048	A	0.541026771068573	And we can make N as large as we want.
2267214	2272060	A	0.8532670140266418	And so they can exchange messages of arbitrary complexity.
2272640	2281580	A	0.6725459098815918	And if they share the meaning of up and down, then they can exchange these messages with no noise, so they can communicate.
2282260	2294050	A	0.863963782787323	And we now have our theory of two communicating agents that are that are sharing arbitrary finite information.
2295240	2302550	A	0.8872030973434448	Now, I've labeled Q one through QN in this picture, a holographic screen.
2303080	2306150	A	0.6339666843414307	And in fact, that's exactly what it is.
2307900	2313000	A	0.9240220189094543	Recall from session one this slide illustrating the holographic principle.
2316540	2321470	A	0.8424875140190125	Shannon made this point that a bit of information is an answer to a yes no question.
2322320	2327916	A	0.8637858629226685	And so we can write down a number of possible states.
2328018	2330220	A	0.7855663299560547	We can write down an entropy.
2331940	2338844	A	0.5507918000221252	And the limiting case of that entropy is the entropy of a black hole.
2338972	2349300	A	0.792315661907196	The densest possible encoding of information in space or on a boundary.
2350520	2360040	A	0.7947239279747009	And this holographic principle allows us to see any boundary, as we discuss in session one, as an encoding of bits.
2360700	2368010	A	0.8953613042831421	So the previous boundary of these in qubits, we can think of as a holographic screen.
2368960	2371310	A	0.6667858958244324	Now, why is that important?
2374640	2402608	A	0.5253045558929443	It's important because it allows us to use this idea of holography and this idea of a fixed encoding of a message or a fixed encoding of an observable entropy at some density that was developed in cosmology to talk about arbitrary quantum communication channels.
2402704	2414890	A	0.6906176209449768	So we can import a whole bunch of theory that was done someplace else into quantum information theory and see that it works perfectly because it describes exactly the same situation.
2416620	2418410	A	0.808063268661499	Now, what does this tell us?
2419840	2431340	A	0.7770612835884094	Philosophically, it tells us that Alice and Bob can learn about each other at most N bits per communication cycle.
2432740	2443250	A	0.8596284985542297	So the maximal amount of information that they can get from an observation is the in bits that the other one wrote on the screen.
2445240	2464200	A	0.644726037979126	So this tells us something very important, that when an agent is looking at their environment, which is this other agent, Bob, the amount of information that can be extracted from the environment is actually proportional to the size in bits of the boundary.
2465260	2470910	A	0.7313186526298523	And the holographic principle just makes that size finite in space.
2471440	2480190	A	0.7973698377609253	And I said early on that there's no embedding spacetime in this theory, that Alice and Bob are not thought of as separated in space.
2480960	2491360	A	0.8361942768096924	But as soon as we use the holographic principle, we can think of the boundary between them as having a spatial coordinate, even though they don't have a spatial coordinate.
2492100	2519880	A	0.8617681264877319	So we'll get back to this point in September when we talk about theories of emergent spacetime, but all of these theories of emergent spacetime come back to this idea that boundaries can have spatial extent, even though the systems that they separate don't have any natural spatial description or natural spatial degrees of freedom.
2522480	2528270	A	0.8726516962051392	Okay, so now let's recall another picture from session one.
2530640	2557370	A	0.9190964698791504	We talked a little bit about Feynman's theory of scattering and the origin of Feynman diagrams and the idea that if Alice prepares some system in some initial state and then measures the state later, if we want to calculate what the new state is.
2558140	2568760	A	0.8957417607307434	We have to take into account all of the possible paths that join the initial state that Alice prepared to the final state that Alice measured.
2570000	2572110	A	0.7886943221092224	So what does that mean?
2572560	2586770	A	0.8792670965194702	I mean, here effectively, if we think of suppose I'm Alice and the boundary is my screen, I'm talking to the screen, and then later on, I'm going to measure the screen.
2587380	2595510	A	0.6775351762771606	And between my preparation actions and my measurement actions, a bunch of stuff happens on the other side of the screen.
2596760	2605444	A	0.764506459236145	And if I want to predict what's going to happen on the other side of the screen, I've got to take into account every possible thing.
2605482	2606630	A	0.7660489082336426	That could happen.
2608040	2613656	A	0.8605174422264099	And I have to give some weight to those possible things that could happen.
2613758	2625870	A	0.8768473267555237	And Quantum theory, in fact, tells you how to assign those weights to things that could happen in order to make a measurement, given some theory of the mechanism that makes things happen.
2627040	2632370	A	0.8275417685508728	But the fact that all of the paths have to be counted is what unitary evolution means.
2633060	2641570	A	0.7426745891571045	This evolution that preserves information that doesn't take any away, it doesn't add any, it just represents it in different ways.
2642100	2654470	A	0.7614167332649231	So if you look at this screen and imagine that Alice is interacting with her boundary and then she's interacting with her boundary again, it looks just like the previous screen.
2654840	2659800	A	0.7699342966079712	And the wavy red arrows are what's happening inside Bob.
2660540	2671630	A	0.9060360193252563	The wavy red arrows are a representation of what's going on inside Bob as he measures his side of the screen and then prepares his side of the screen.
2672320	2684370	A	0.7512921690940857	So what Feynman is representing here is just the action of the environment or the action of the system while Alice isn't looking.
2684980	2693040	A	0.8953693509101868	Between Alice's preparation stage and her measurement stage, while Bob is doing his measurement and preparation.
2693780	2696832	A	0.7250462174415588	So this diagram is actually completely symmetrical.
2696896	2704896	A	0.8726626634597778	We could have drawn an arrow where the wavy red things are and drawn wavy red things where we talked about Alice.
2705008	2708410	A	0.8013938665390015	And we'd have the same picture just from Bob's point of view.
2709260	2722830	A	0.9060508012771606	We can also think of this, of course, as Alice communicating with her future self by writing a memory record someplace in the world and then coming back and reading it.
2723680	2739650	A	0.7971509695053101	And if Alice writes a memory on the world and then comes back later on and reads it, she actually has to take into account some theory of all of the things the world might have done to her memory while she wasn't looking.
2741460	2746660	A	0.8689810633659363	So this picture of Feynman's actually tells us a lot about memory.
2747400	2762952	A	0.7836053967475891	And when we think about organisms running around in the world doing things like we do all the time, we tend to think of memories as things that are persistent and unchanging and all of that.
2763006	2764890	A	0.5549447536468506	But we know that that's not true.
2765340	2768730	A	0.7966829538345337	We know that memories degrade in various ways.
2769600	2781340	A	0.5589694976806641	We know that adversarial third parties can come and change what we've done so that they fool us into thinking that we've remembered something that we haven't.
2781700	2783600	A	0.7454196214675903	And so on and so forth.
2784260	2796740	A	0.8932688236236572	That whole picture of memory is actually encoded in this picture that Feynman drew in the late fifty S to represent scattering of particles.
2800680	2807030	A	0.7634168863296509	So what we've done here is started with this simple idea of asking questions.
2808060	2812164	A	0.5815233588218689	And we've actually constructed a fair amount of Quantum theory.
2812212	2816628	A	0.8525733947753906	We constructed the Schrodinger equation, we constructed the unitary propagator.
2816724	2824700	A	0.6752974390983582	We constructed the idea of a reference frame, which we'll talk about intensely next time in July.
2825760	2832370	A	0.8313158750534058	So we can sum this up by saying that Quantum theory simply is a theory of communicating agents.
2833300	2854704	A	0.49083778262138367	And that quantum mechanics, the theory that Feynman was complaining about in that earlier slide, that quantum mechanics generates this problem that seems intractable of how to understand measurement, because the theory is in fact about measurement.
2854832	2857690	A	0.6895466446876526	It's not about mechanical motion at all.
2858460	2862920	A	0.5058519244194031	So quantum theory actually tells us nothing about ontology.
2864300	2875912	A	0.5336836576461792	And this is why the interpretations of quantum theory, the many worlds interpretation, where you have all these branching universes and so forth, are not really science.
2875976	2877112	A	0.7307204008102417	They're philosophy.
2877176	2885788	A	0.5895922183990479	They're attempts to understand an ontology that's generated by a theory that doesn't talk about ontology.
2885884	2888850	A	0.8840668797492981	It talks about communication between agents.
2889780	2892528	A	0.5730472207069397	But we've left something very important out.
2892694	2900070	A	0.6549880504608154	We've left out a consideration of what happens when Alice and Bob don't mean the same thing by up and down.
2900760	2910136	A	0.6828789114952087	And we've left out the famous phenomenon of entanglement spooky action at a distance, as Einstein called it.
2910238	2914680	A	0.6078862547874451	And it turns out these things that we've left out are very, very closely related.
2916060	2919604	A	0.8453767895698547	And we're going to see why in July.
2919732	2922604	A	0.8802435994148254	But I'm going to give you a brief preview now.
2922802	2928284	A	0.754625141620636	So what happens when Alice and Bob actually mean different things by up and down?
2928482	2931660	A	0.4997856318950653	What if their reference frames aren't aligned?
2932880	2937680	A	0.6934942007064819	Well, the first thing to note is that nothing in the theory says they have to be aligned.
2938180	2941490	A	0.7905992865562439	So we have to consider the possibility that they're not.
2942420	2949040	A	0.8579689860343933	And in fact, both Alice and Bob have to have what's called free choice of reference frame.
2949200	2957560	A	0.8956805467605591	When Alice prepares her instrument, she has to be able to prepare it any way she wants to in order to do an experiment.
2959020	2971710	A	0.8451750874519348	And when Bob makes up a sentence to tell Alice, he has to be able to choose any language he wants to use, he's a free agent in this way.
2972080	2975544	A	0.7172054052352905	And if they don't have that freedom, it turns out they're entangled.
2975672	2981900	A	0.7146868109703064	So reference frame, nonalignment and entanglement are very, very closely coupled.
2984420	2991120	A	0.5327709913253784	Now, misalignment of reference frames is what produces superpositions of outcomes.
2991940	3014776	A	0.7707143425941467	So if Alice makes her measurements with her up and down arrow arranged vertically, for example, but Bob prepares his qubit with his up and down arrow arranged at 90 degrees to Alice's, alice is not going to have any idea what Bob did.
3014958	3018820	A	0.6573636531829834	I mean, she can't see distinctions in the left right direction.
3018900	3022380	A	0.754849910736084	She can only see distinctions in the up and down direction.
3022880	3025580	A	0.5872709155082703	So all she can do is flip a coin.
3026080	3036608	A	0.785028874874115	If she wants to know what Bob prepared, it's 50% likely he prepared up for her what she calls one.
3036774	3041088	A	0.7674909234046936	And it's 50% likely that he prepared what's down for her.
3041174	3042370	A	0.6636780500411987	She can't tell.
3044040	3049744	A	0.8791342973709106	Now, if Bob's reference frame is pointing at about 45 degrees.
3049872	3057690	A	0.8916976451873779	So up for him means 45 degrees off of Alice's up, then she can sort of tell what he did.
3058300	3066010	A	0.8897002339363098	If he's pointing 45 degrees from up, then she's probably going to measure up.
3066460	3071230	A	0.8307136297225952	And if he's pointing 45 degrees from down, she's probably going to measure down.
3071600	3077420	A	0.8306978940963745	So her outcomes are 75% for one and 25% for minus one.
3077490	3081660	A	0.849662721157074	If he prepares at this 45 degree angle.
3082260	3084624	A	0.8828916549682617	So we can write this in a particular way.
3084662	3106368	A	0.8900225758552551	We can say that the value that Alice gets acting with her M on a qubit that Bob prepared is some number times what she measures as up plus some other number plus times what she measures as minus one, where those numbers, the squares of those numbers, add to one.
3106554	3108344	A	0.579547643661499	So why do they have to add to one?
3108462	3111720	A	0.8661649823188782	Well, they add to one because of the Pythagorean theorem.
3114300	3120540	A	0.8261215686798096	One is the distance, the total distance between the two outcomes.
3121360	3127740	A	0.8676782250404358	And A squared plus B squared are the other two sides of that triangle.
3128480	3146256	A	0.8587539792060852	So another way to think of it is that the metric distance in possibility space is one and A squared and B squared are just the Euclidean distance components.
3146288	3149936	A	0.8838751316070557	Again, Euclidean distance is based on the Pythagorean theorem.
3150128	3153060	A	0.8631048202514648	So this is the Born rule in quantum theory.
3154120	3162490	A	0.8606058955192566	It's the rule that tells us what happens when we're trying to measure a superposition and it tells us where these superpositions come from.
3164220	3170140	A	0.5796910524368286	We have a mismatch in reference frames between two agents that are communicating.
3172480	3189330	A	0.8072092533111572	So if we go back to the free energy principle, which is what this whole active inference class is about, and we formulate it in quantum theory, we get a very simple idea of what the free energy principle is.
3189940	3201910	A	0.7843860983848572	The FEP and quantum theory just says that interacting systems are going to behave in a way that aligns their reference frames and that makes their communication as good as it can be.
3203640	3217160	A	0.6178559064865112	But since aligning reference frames perfectly leads to entanglement, the free energy principle drives systems asymptotically toward entanglement.
3219360	3226540	A	0.8414928913116455	Well, the principle of unitarity says that all systems will approach entanglement asymptotically.
3226960	3232540	A	0.8494443893432617	So we can see the FEP is actually a classical statement of the principle of unitarity.
3233540	3249860	A	0.8435801267623901	And what we'll see in the next session is why this is the case, why active inference, when we think of it, quantum mechanically is a way of talking about the principle of unitarity, which is the deepest axiom of quantum theory.
3250840	3265320	A	0.7681992053985596	And we'll also see that this question of alignment becomes more and more complex as the complexity of the messages that the systems are trying to communicate to each other increases.
3266220	3270860	A	0.73244708776474	And that message complexity correlates with system complexity.
3271440	3279950	A	0.5028918981552124	So that aligning complicated systems is very hard, although aligning very simple systems is fairly easy.
3280480	3293410	A	0.5494786500930786	And if you think about what's the simplest possible theory in science, it's particle physics, because you're dealing with these very simple things that interact in extremely simple ways.
3294120	3306752	A	0.6234095096588135	And the really difficult parts of science are things like sociology, where you're dealing with incredibly complicated systems like humans that interact in incredibly complicated ways.
3306906	3312250	A	0.52141273021698	And all we have are very vague kind of folk theories of how that works.
3313180	3319370	A	0.6471943259239197	But we know from that example that aligning complex systems is extremely difficult.
3321580	3324030	A	0.9331569671630859	So humans don't get along very well.
3325600	3334610	A	0.6118137836456299	So the second session well, the second discussion section which Andrew will be leading is on Saturday, the 1 July, a couple of weeks from now.
3335540	3361780	A	0.7415562868118286	The third lecture session will be on July 13 and I hope you all will contribute to the interactive question and answer session on the web and show up for the discussion on Saturday, the 1 July and join us again in July for the discussion of quantum reference frames and reference frame alignment.
3361940	3363530	A	0.9706712365150452	So thank you very much.
3368970	3370470	B	0.8918594717979431	Thank you, Chris.
3372170	3372790	C	0.4896698594093323	All right.
3372860	3374070	B	0.972380518913269	Thank you all again.
3374140	3382002	B	0.8872153759002686	Please check out the chorus syllabus, ask questions through the site and see you at the discussion.
3382066	3383414	B	0.6020334959030151	See you next time.
3383612	3384262	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3384316	3384666	C	0.5137447118759155	Bye.
3384738	3384860	A	0.5428686141967773	It.
