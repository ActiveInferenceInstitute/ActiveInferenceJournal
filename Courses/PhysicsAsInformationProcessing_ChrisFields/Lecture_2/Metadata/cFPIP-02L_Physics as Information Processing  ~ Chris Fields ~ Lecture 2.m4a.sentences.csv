7800	8870	2	B	0.98612	Hello, everyone.
9320	12148	3	B	0.99014	It's June 15, 2023.
12314	19280	4	B	0.99934	We are here in lecture two of Chris field's course, physics as Information Processing.
19360	19700	5	B	0.99123	So.
19770	21040	6	B	0.99977	Thank you, Chris.
21200	23460	7	B	0.99998	Looking forward to the lecture.
25240	26660	8	A	0.62583	Thank you, Daniel.
27160	29380	9	A	0.99	And, yes, welcome to this session.
29840	30492	10	A	0.88265	How?
30626	34300	11	A	0.99991	This section is titled why Quantum Physics.
35440	54560	12	A	1	And if you will recall, from the first session, we reviewed the history of physics and some of the history of mathematics and computer science from the end of the 19th century through to the beginning of the 21st century.
55400	90808	13	A	0.98	And discuss the slow development from classical thermodynamics of quantum information theory and specifically characterizing quantum information theory as a new kind of physics that describes systems that are exchanging finite amounts of discretely encoded information across some intervening boundary.
90984	112928	14	A	0.73	And so we use this very conventional graphical notation of two agents or physical systems, alice and Bob, A and B, that are exchanging energy and information across some boundary.
113104	120680	15	A	1	And I always use a blue ellipse like this to indicate the boundary that separates Alice from Bob.
121500	128884	16	A	0.97	And this new approach to physics is entirely topological.
129012	130840	17	A	0.61556	It's not geometric.
131360	140620	18	A	0.99993	So it doesn't assume a particular background spacetime, so it doesn't assume that Alice and Bob are spatially separated.
141920	159844	19	A	0.81	And so this makes it a very different kind of theory from classical information theory in that the channel that separates Alice from Bob, this boundary is a boundary in state space.
160042	164612	20	A	0.99947	It's not a boundary in some geometric embedding space.
164666	173880	21	A	0.76	And in particular, it's not a boundary or a channel that's embedded in a three dimensional space that separates Alice from Bob.
175500	194770	22	A	0.62006	So that's what we talked about last time and today what I want to discuss is how quantum theory in particular makes this idea of physics as a theory of communication simple and obvious.
196260	211590	23	A	0.96	And quantum theory, of course, has a terrible reputation of being abstruse and mathematically incredibly complicated and counterintuitive and difficult to understand.
212520	224490	24	A	0.83	And this is one quotation among many from leading physicists pointing out that quantum mechanics is just difficult.
225900	239580	25	A	1	And as you probably know, there's an entire philosophical industry of interpretations of quantum theory that try to make sense of its ontology.
242900	248720	26	A	0.73773	What I don't want to do today is try to introduce quantum mechanics.
250340	253730	27	A	0.98645	We're not doing any of this.
254740	264660	28	A	0.99996	Some of you will recognize this as the table of contents, the first part of the table of contents of the famous textbook by Landau and Lifts.
265080	266004	29	A	0.75312	How that?
266042	275930	30	A	0.84385	If you've studied quantum theory in undergraduate or graduate school, you've probably dealt with a textbook structured much like this one.
276300	294530	31	A	1	And you've probably been introduced to quantum mechanics as it was traditionally conceived as essentially a mechanical theory, a theory of motion with wave functions and particle representations and on and on and on.
294980	297264	32	A	0.92022	So we're not going to try to do that.
297382	318810	33	A	0.56699	This what we're going to do instead is take a completely information theoretic approach, and we're going to characterize information transfer in a quantum theoretic way without any assumptions about mechanics or spacetime or any of that.
319500	323770	34	A	0.99992	So instead of this, we're going to ask a simple question.
325580	331788	35	A	0.99988	By a simple question, I mean a question with just a yes no answer or a binary answer.
331874	336670	36	A	0.99983	So let's use up or down as our example question.
338160	341070	37	A	0.56	And to ask this question, we need three things.
342340	343932	38	A	0.89	First, we need an action.
343996	346290	39	A	0.99987	We need a way of asking it.
347860	351730	40	A	0.99999	For example, making a sound or writing something down.
353860	359030	41	A	1	Second, we need a thing that we can ask the question of.
360040	373930	42	A	0.99999	We need an environment or a friend or the rest of the world or an experimental apparatus or some system or other that we're going to act on to ask this question.
375100	381100	43	A	0.71	And the third thing that we need to ask this question is a shared language.
381520	389100	44	A	1	And it's the shared language that's often neglected in models based in physics.
390880	396300	45	A	0.98	And I think the importance of the shared language became clear in classical information theory.
396460	400572	46	A	1	And it's become clear again, of course, in quantum information theory.
400716	404080	47	A	0.99957	But this has only happened over the last few decades.
404840	418664	48	A	0.97234	So what I want to do today is to construct in a step by step fashion a formal representation of these three things that we need to ask a simple question.
418862	424628	49	A	0.83	And what we'll find is that that formal representation is in fact quantum theory.
424724	435436	50	A	0.50235	So it's quantum theory that provides us with a formal representation of asking these simple binary questions.
435618	441950	51	A	1	And of course, if you can ask a binary question, you can ask any finite number of binary questions.
442420	455670	52	A	0.96096	So you can construct an Arbitrarily complex finite decision tree that ends up formulating an Arbitrarily complex but still finite question.
456040	462870	53	A	0.99992	So this really is a general model of communicative interactions between agents.
465240	472104	54	A	0.99977	So let's go about this and talk first about the action of asking you a question.
472222	488030	55	A	0.92	And so the first thing I want you to do is actually say out loud up or down, actually ask a question and then note two things about what just happened.
489440	493856	56	A	0.88	The first thing to note is that it took some time to do that.
494038	503970	57	A	0.94139	That action actually required a finite amount of time, a couple of seconds, not very long, but it's not zero.
504740	507590	58	A	0.99989	It always takes time to ask a question.
508440	514870	59	A	1	And the second thing to note is that it took energy to actually say up or down.
515400	520650	60	A	0.99739	It requires a little bit of exertion to ask a question.
521660	526920	61	A	0.99955	So let's put those two together and define a word.
526990	533596	62	A	0.98958	We're going to define the word action to mean some energy that's spent in some time.
533778	544944	63	A	0.74476	So asking a question is an action and it qualifies as an action because it requires spending some energy in some finite amount of time.
545142	549170	64	A	1	And so we can write this as action equals energy times time.
549540	553730	65	A	0.99914	Or I'll sometimes use the abbreviation E times T.
556100	571736	66	A	1	And action is always required when there's some interaction or two way action between systems.
571848	583330	67	A	0.99998	So whenever we talk about physical interaction, we're always talking about two systems doing something to each other that requires both energy and time.
584980	588220	68	A	0.87454	So let's define another concept.
588300	595750	69	A	1	A concept of a minimum action needed to ask a question, and specifically a question with a binary answer.
597000	601696	70	A	1	And we'll just pick a symbol to stand for that minimum action.
601888	605590	71	A	1	And the symbol we'll use because it's conventional is h.
606200	629260	72	A	1	And it turns out that this h is planck's constant, the number that planck came up with when he was trying to solve the black body problem back in 1900 that we talked about last time and recall, that was the problem of characterizing, the spectrum of radiation emitted by some physical system.
629330	630430	73	A	0.9509	That was hot.
630800	633920	74	A	1	How much energy comes out as a function of temperature.
634660	642304	75	A	1	And if you assume that the spectrum of energy coming out is continuous, you get predictions that are wrong.
642502	658824	76	A	0.63	And Planck got predictions that were correct by assuming that that spectrum was discrete and that this h represented the minimum amount of energy that could be emitted in a particular time.
658942	663400	77	A	1	So it represented the minimum energy times time or action.
663980	666490	78	A	0.99995	So let's look at an example of that.
667500	669976	79	A	1	And here's an example that may be familiar.
670088	673310	80	A	0.99367	It's the example of your own visual system.
674640	695750	81	A	0.99602	So in the retinal, the cells of your retinas, there are many, many molecules that are rodoxins of one variety or other that respond to different wavelengths of visible light, and they have some efficiency for capturing light.
696280	703430	82	A	0.67	And let's just assume that they're optimally efficient, that they're as efficient as they could possibly be.
704200	727372	83	A	0.65	And that means that they require the minimum amount of energy to change shape, which is what they do when they're impacted by Light to capture the energy and hence the information that's available in the Light and the minimum energy to do anything that records one bit of information.
727506	728796	84	A	0.99995	So yes or no?
728898	732112	85	A	0.99969	Up or down is 0.7.
732166	739760	86	A	0.99045	So log two of Boltzman's constant times the temperature.
741060	744370	87	A	1	And again, we saw this last time.
745080	760340	88	A	0.99992	This is from roughly 1875 and was then built into classical information theory by Shannon and then by Landauer in the mid 20th century.
760680	769720	89	A	0.98735	So what we're doing is assuming that since rudopsin is optimally efficient, all it requires is this amount of energy to change shape.
770300	775944	90	A	0.69	And it's known experimentally, that rhodopsin takes about 200 femtoseconds to change shape.
775992	779436	91	A	0.99999	So that's 200 times ten to the -15.
779538	780392	92	A	0.45	Seconds.
780536	784320	93	A	0.99998	So it's a very very fast reaction, chemical reaction.
785140	807910	94	A	0.99999	So we can just calculate what the action is and at 37 degrees centigrade so human body temperature KT is about 4.3 times ten to the -21 Joule and Joule is just a standard unit of energy and so we can multiply everything together.
809800	811992	95	A	0.97586	KT times zero seven times.
812046	825260	96	A	0.97024	This response time of 200 femtoseconds multiplied together gives you an action of about six times ten to the -34 joule seconds.
825840	836604	97	A	0.58	And if you're familiar with quantum mechanics, you'll instantly recognize that number because it's very close to the value of Planck's Constant, which is 6.6 times.
836642	837792	98	A	0.83	Ten to the -34.
837846	838780	99	A	0.75	Joule seconds.
838860	842720	100	A	0.64526	So this says that Rhodopsin is very near to optimal.
845480	850736	101	A	0.43	The best it would be able to do would be Planck's constant.
850848	854180	102	A	0.98621	That's the minimum action that can be undertaken.
855720	859290	103	A	0.99864	So Rodobson is clearly doing very well.
860220	868840	104	A	0.9998	It can't be as efficient as we're assuming it to be, but it's pretty efficient.
869180	877868	105	A	0.99969	So this number Planck's constant is and this idea of a minimum action is not something we just pulled out of the air.
878034	880216	106	A	0.98024	It's something that one can observe.
880328	888290	107	A	1	When you're looking at what real biological systems in particular do and other physical systems do.
889860	897380	108	A	0.99961	So let's think about the second component of this project of asking a question.
897450	899830	109	A	0.96	And that's the thing to be asked.
900840	903348	110	A	0.72	And we want to ask a very simple question.
903434	906870	111	A	0.99938	We want to have a theory of asking very simple questions.
907340	915290	112	A	0.99294	So let's define the simplest thing that we can ask a binary question to.
915660	923484	113	A	1	And let's say this is the thing that we can ask a binary question of using just this minimum action h.
923682	930030	114	A	0.99859	So we're going to ask for the minimal thing that it's possible physically to ask a question of.
930560	934160	115	A	0.79	And this thing needs a name, so let's call it a qubit.
934740	938210	116	A	1	And that word is a contraction of Quantum bit.
939300	940832	117	A	1	And we can draw it like this.
940886	943104	118	A	1	A little sphere with an arrow through it.
943222	945380	119	A	0.99942	That's called a block sphere.
946040	947504	120	A	1	And we use a symbol.
947552	948244	121	A	0.96	Q.
948442	957556	122	A	1	And that notation with the bar and the angle bracket is called a bra notation.
957668	960228	123	A	1	And it originates with Durac.
960404	972350	124	A	0.99966	So it's a traditional way of writing inner products, actually, in quantum theory to indicate the state of Q.
973360	980556	125	A	0.74539	So this thing called a qubit only responds to binary questions.
980738	983776	126	A	0.86159	So it clearly can have only two states.
983878	987410	127	A	0.97	The state that answers yes and the state that answers no.
987860	989440	128	A	1	And conventionally.
989780	993344	129	A	0.99998	We draw the arrow going up if the answer is yes.
993382	996308	130	A	0.71	And the arrow going down if the answer is no.
996474	1003350	131	A	1	And so those are the two states that the qubit can be in when it's answered a question.
1004520	1011480	132	A	0.69605	So now let's draw a picture for the act of asking a question of q in the state.
1011550	1011832	133	A	0.93	Q.
1011886	1013530	134	A	1	And let's draw it like this.
1015180	1021596	135	A	0.91971	This curvy arrow is the action of asking the question and getting the answer back.
1021778	1025740	136	A	1	And we're asking it of this minimum system, the qubit.
1026240	1038080	137	A	0.98	And let's call this entire act of h and write h acting on Q by this expression HQ.
1038660	1048660	138	A	0.99946	So again, we're developing the notation of quantum theory, which all of you who know the theory already will find familiar.
1050680	1058360	139	A	0.60563	So the third thing that we have to build into this picture and into the theory is the shared language.
1059740	1068810	140	A	0.99989	So we have to know what we mean by up or down if we're going to ask the question up or down?
1070000	1080110	141	A	0.89	And we have to have some representation of what it means for the qubit to distinguish up or down.
1080560	1094560	142	A	0.99966	So let's say that to us, up and down mean this little diagram with an arrow that's labeled up on one end and down on the other end.
1094710	1100048	143	A	0.99995	So we're defining up and down in a very simple way as just opposites.
1100144	1103888	144	A	0.99999	We don't know anything else about them except that they're opposites.
1104064	1107412	145	A	0.87808	So this is a stripped down one bit question.
1107546	1110296	146	A	0.82971	We could have called them one and minus one.
1110478	1112312	147	A	0.99999	We could have called them A and B.
1112366	1113930	148	A	0.99995	We could have called them anything.
1114860	1120460	149	A	0.80451	We're just indicating that up and down are two opposing concepts.
1121200	1133760	150	A	1	And so this object that we've used to make this definition of the relationship between our two words up and down is called a reference frame.
1135220	1143120	151	A	0.99912	It's a physical object that encodes a concept or a meaning.
1144120	1165160	152	A	0.99	And if you think about using language, using English, for example, you can understand me speaking in English because your brain has the right sorts of neural circuits to allow you to understand English and produce English using your hand in your mouth.
1165820	1174616	153	A	0.97	And those neural circuits are reference frames in your brain for understanding and producing English.
1174728	1178270	154	A	1	And they encode the relationships between different words.
1179600	1183040	155	A	0.99598	So you all know about Chat GPT.
1183540	1201940	156	A	0.93	You can think of all of the weights on all of the ten to the 19th or however many parameters there are in GPT four as a reference frame that describes the relationships between words and phrases in English and many other languages.
1202280	1214452	157	A	0.99996	So this idea of a reference frame is an instance of Landauer's principle, which is often summarized as saying that information is physical.
1214596	1228700	158	A	1	What that means is that information always has to have some encoding and that encoding, that object can always be thought of as a reference frame.
1229840	1231950	159	A	0.99995	So let's put all this stuff together.
1234100	1240208	160	A	0.99998	What we have now is a reference frame that defines the difference between up and down.
1240374	1251110	161	A	1	We have an action that we've labeled H, and the action acts on this object, the qubit, which is in some state.
1252520	1256900	162	A	1	And what we've drawn here now is an experiment.
1257660	1268324	163	A	0.94	And you can think of the incoming part of the arrow that goes from the reference frame to the qubit as a preparation of the qubit.
1268452	1280590	164	A	0.99744	So you can think of it as I'm doing something to the qubit to put it in a particular state like up, because that's the state I want it to be in.
1281680	1290930	165	A	0.99	And I can think of this returning part of the arrow as a measurement of the state that the qubit is actually in.
1291460	1302930	166	A	0.99987	So if the qubit is actually in this state with the arrow pointing up, then I'm going to get back the answer up when I act on the qubit to measure its state.
1304420	1328556	167	A	0.99982	So now we can recognize this action, H as the Hamiltonian operator in quantum theory, which always takes some time, which we represent by an interval DT, to act on some state, and in particular this binary state, Q.
1328738	1335360	168	A	0.99975	So this whole picture depicts the action of a very simple Hamiltonian operator.
1337380	1346070	169	A	0.83	And again, I want to emphasize that we've just defined the qubit as the simplest thing that we can ask a binary question of.
1348920	1351110	170	A	0.99981	So how does this H work?
1352840	1361450	171	A	0.99994	We can use H to prepare this qubit in one of two states, which we're going to label one and minus one.
1362140	1375292	172	A	1	The state one corresponds to the up direction, and the state minus one corresponds to the down direction, and doing this to Q.
1375426	1382288	173	A	0.99995	So preparing Q in one of these two states takes energy, and we know how much.
1382454	1394556	174	A	0.9597	Boltzman told us back in 1875 that the minimum energy to reduce the entropy of the universe by one bit is log two of KT.
1394748	1398720	175	A	1	We saw that earlier when we were thinking about Rhodobson.
1399240	1409864	176	A	0.92532	So we can say that acting with H always requires some number times KT, where that number is bigger than the log of two.
1409982	1431612	177	A	0.99998	Remember, the log of two is just in there to get units of bits of binary questions, as opposed to units of nats, which are questions that have e answers, where E is the exponential base, the natural exponential base.
1431746	1437010	178	A	0.94446	But we want to use units of bits, so we have to always have this factor of log two.
1438500	1442480	179	A	0.99999	So this lets us write H in a particular way.
1442550	1452900	180	A	0.99996	We can take out this energetic term that Boltzman tells us we have to include beta times KT.
1454040	1462868	181	A	1	And what's left over is, in a sense, the pure representation of the action, stripping out the energy requirement.
1463044	1472380	182	A	1	And we're going to call that M, because M is the standard symbol to use in quantum theory for a measurement operator.
1473520	1476552	183	A	1	And M is now dimensionless.
1476696	1487712	184	A	0.67	H has units of energy, KT is an energy, and M has no units at all.
1487846	1490290	185	A	0.99998	So it's H without the energy.
1491300	1505220	186	A	0.99982	So now we can ask, what is this operator M that we've defined as the simplest possible action on a qubit, but abstracting away the amount of energy that we have to use to act on the qubit.
1506200	1512490	187	A	0.74517	Well, what M does is just encode a bit or decode a bit.
1513740	1520760	188	A	0.99981	So we can use this operator M to say, I want Q to have the value one.
1520910	1530030	189	A	1	I want it to be up, so I can sort of reach out with my operator M and grab Q and turn it so that its arrow is pointing up.
1531600	1534332	190	A	1	And that's the operation.
1534396	1536284	191	A	0.94603	That's called preparation in physics.
1536332	1539644	192	A	0.99543	It's what it means to prepare an experimental apparatus.
1539692	1548070	193	A	1	For example, you actually grab hold of the apparatus, and you twist some knobs and flick some switches to prepare it to be in some state.
1549320	1554160	194	A	0.53	And you can use M to measure a state that isn't known.
1554320	1565290	195	A	0.91572	So I can use M to grab a hold of Q and look at it and determine whether it's in state one or minus one.
1566140	1574940	196	A	1	And I can represent these as just a cycle that starts with measuring and then prepares, or that starts with preparing and then measuring.
1575840	1589052	197	A	1	And if I represent it that way, what I see is M having a value which is either the value I want to encode or the value that I have measured.
1589196	1603510	198	A	0.56	And Q and M acts on that value and Q to produce a particular state of Q, to put Q in a particular state, or to realize that Q is in that state.
1604840	1613000	199	A	0.79	And so M is actually an identity acting on some value and Q.
1613150	1624664	200	A	0.99999	So it maps one in Q to one in Q, and it maps minus one in Q to minus one in Q if you do the whole cycle of preparation and then measurement.
1624792	1625852	201	A	0.97	And that makes sense.
1625906	1639024	202	A	0.99872	It's actually an axiom in some formulations of quantum theory that if I measure the state of some object, what I'm doing is also preparing it in that state.
1639142	1643010	203	A	0.99999	So if I immediately measure it again, I'll see the same value.
1644580	1646512	204	A	0.82	And that makes sense physically.
1646576	1655540	205	A	0.5772	If I put my coffee cup on the table and then I look for it, it's likely going to be on the table unless something else intervenes.
1656200	1657464	206	A	0.9499	Well, what does this mean?
1657502	1660280	207	A	0.99996	It means that we can do a little bit of algebra.
1662860	1680670	208	A	0.9999	It means that we can write this original expression of acting on Q with our Hamiltonian in this somewhat more explicit form of using the energy beta KT and our operator M on Q.
1681540	1687890	209	A	0.81	And what I get out of that is the energy beta KT multiplied by Q.
1690020	1693360	210	A	0.99993	So HQ equals EQ.
1694200	1696180	211	A	0.99937	That's the Schrodinger equation.
1696520	1700016	212	A	0.7181	So that's one of the central equations of quantum theory.
1700208	1707450	213	A	0.99989	What it says is that this operator, H, is the total energy operator on a system.
1707980	1712344	214	A	0.99971	Its eigenvalues are the total energies of the system.
1712542	1723576	215	A	1	And we can now see where that energy is coming from in this very, very simple, stripped down kind of representation of an action.
1723768	1732930	216	A	1	The energy is the thermodynamic energy that has to be spent to determine one binary outcome up or down.
1734900	1746500	217	A	0.99999	Now, if you're familiar with quantum mechanics, you will have seen exponentiated operators like the next line here of algebra.
1748120	1762420	218	A	0.99995	This operator P, which is time dependent and which is the exponential of H multiplied by it over H bar, is called the propagator.
1762500	1770190	219	A	0.72953	It's the unitary operator in quantum theory, the operator that conserves probability or conserves information.
1772080	1785730	220	A	0.96	And so, using the representation of H as beta KT, we can see that this operator P is just E to the minus beta M.
1787460	1803540	221	A	1	If we recall the WIC rotation from the first session, this strange equivalence of it over H bar with one over KT that wasn't discovered until 50 years after the invention of quantum theory.
1805000	1809960	222	A	1	And it's still a very debated thing.
1810030	1813850	223	A	0.95	I mean, people worry about what this equation really means.
1814540	1836690	224	A	1	But one thing that it means in this setting where H has this particularly simple form is that the propagator is now just the exponential of a number multiplied by this very simple strip down operator that encodes a bit or decodes a bit.
1838020	1842480	225	A	0.99996	But we know something about the exponential propagator just by looking at its form.
1842630	1848740	226	A	0.99999	If you're again familiar with these sorts of exponential operators, you know that they're wave equations.
1849720	1854608	227	A	0.69	And we can make sense of that using the diagram up above.
1854784	1859160	228	A	0.99998	What M is doing is just performing a cycle.
1860220	1867850	229	A	0.99745	It's just mapping one and Q back to itself, or minus one and Q back to itself.
1868620	1884290	230	A	0.99997	So we can think of M as just taking this object and flipping it back around until it gets itself again.
1885860	1894608	231	A	0.51	And that kind of cycle can always be turned into a wave equation and e to the I over H bar times.
1894694	1903524	232	A	0.6668	HT is a canonical form of a wave equation, where the horizontal axis here on the wave is time.
1903722	1917370	233	A	0.99983	Or if you look at the little cycle that I've drawn as a circle with an arrow, it's the time of the thing spinning around like this, which is exactly the same thing as a wave traveling through time.
1918540	1921070	234	A	0.99997	So that tells us something very important.
1922240	1929340	235	A	0.99909	It tells us that this equivalent expression, e to the minus beta M, is also a wave equation.
1929920	1937170	236	A	0.99997	So it tells us that this operator M has built into it some sense of time.
1939540	1943760	237	A	0.99678	It's the sense of time of this prepare measure cycle.
1944820	1948112	238	A	1	And that's implicit in m right.
1948166	1958170	239	A	0.62746	We've used the WIC rotation to get rid of what I'll end up calling the external time t, the objective time T.
1959340	1971420	240	A	1	And we'll see in July where this internal time comes from in terms of the WIC rotation.
1972160	1977948	241	A	0.99996	But we can say now that it's an agent specific time.
1978114	1992770	242	A	0.54612	It's an internal time reference frame that's built into our idea of this system, Alice, that can act on the world, and it represents the time that's required to ask this question.
1994280	1997716	243	C	0.99883	Okay, can I ask a question at this point?
1997898	1998630	244	A	0.99998	Yes.
1999240	2004260	245	C	0.51044	So on this slide with the operator M, I'm curious.
2004600	2011240	246	C	1	How can the agent deploy in the operator M tell the difference or break the symmetry between preparation and measurement?
2012060	2015000	247	C	0.99991	Or are they just completely dual pictures?
2016060	2017572	248	A	0.99945	Yeah, they're completely dual.
2017636	2021720	249	A	0.98807	So the agent never breaks the symmetry.
2021800	2027340	250	A	1	The agent can't actually distinguish the act of preparing from the act of measuring.
2028640	2032988	251	A	0.99922	Every preparation is a measurement, and every measurement is a preparation.
2033164	2033890	252	C	0.97429	Right.
2034340	2046310	253	A	0.99175	That's, in fact, what this axiom of unitarity measuring a state leaves the particle in the measured state means.
2046760	2047510	254	C	0.71717	Right.
2049800	2052180	255	A	0.99198	So, yeah, mathematically, they're duals.
2053320	2054230	256	C	0.99995	Thank you.
2057420	2064360	257	A	0.97276	Okay, so let's now use this theory that we've developed to describe the interaction between Alice and Bob.
2064940	2079150	258	A	1	And let's think of a situation in which Alice prepares a qubit that Bob then measures, and then Bob prepares the very same qubit, and then Alice measures it.
2079680	2090720	259	A	0.97238	So Alice acts with her Hamiltonian operator, which we'll label Ha, and Bob acts with his Hamiltonian operator that we label HB.
2092020	2097030	260	A	0.58	And let's say that Alice prepares the qubit as in state up.
2097800	2104870	261	A	1	And Bob can then measure the qubit in state up and say, oh, the qubit is now up.
2105720	2117368	262	A	1	And if Bob then prepares the qubit in state down, alice can measure the qubit in state down and say, oh, the qubit switched from the up that I prepared to down.
2117454	2119950	263	A	0.99998	So Bob must have prepared it as down.
2120880	2122590	264	A	0.99986	So what's happened here?
2123920	2128700	265	A	0.96318	Alice and Bob have actually shared a bit flip.
2130480	2137650	266	A	0.94942	Alice said up and Bob said, down, and Alice heard him say down.
2138100	2143890	267	A	0.9996	So they've shared this idea of change by interacting with each other.
2144680	2149510	268	A	0.66145	Now, this works as long as they mean the same thing by up and down.
2150040	2160730	269	A	0.83224	So we've implicitly assumed, in talking about them communicating, that they both have this reference frame that distinguishes up from down.
2162220	2170876	270	A	1	And this is actually a completely general model of what I'll call a noiseless one qubit channel.
2171058	2172636	271	A	0.99546	Now, what does that mean?
2172818	2177692	272	A	0.80268	It's noiseless because there's nothing else in the picture, right?
2177746	2183112	273	A	0.95861	There's nothing in the picture that can jiggle the qubit when Alice and Bob aren't looking.
2183186	2190604	274	A	0.92524	Alice and Bob are the only systems we're talking about, and they share this qubit and there's nothing else in the picture.
2190652	2202944	275	A	0.51706	So there's no kind of third party or environment or heat bath or anything like that that's going to mess with the qubit and disrupt their interaction.
2203072	2215210	276	A	0.99994	So that's a noiseless channel and it's a one qubit channel because they just have one qubit that they're interacting with and they're alternately preparing and measuring its state.
2216620	2223100	277	A	1	Now, clearly, if they can interact using one qubit, they can interact using any finite number of qubits.
2223760	2236240	278	A	0.99975	So here's a picture of an in qubit channel that Alice and Bob, which here I've labeled A and B because I took this figure from a paper, are sharing.
2236900	2245330	279	A	0.99	And Alice and Bob both have N operators, one for each of the N qubits that they share.
2245700	2250192	280	A	0.5	And they just do this prepared measurement cycle on all N qubits.
2250256	2264180	281	A	0.99996	So you can think of Alice preparing the N qubits, bob measuring the N qubits, and then Bob preparing and Alice measuring, and that allows them to exchange N bit messages.
2264340	2267048	282	A	1	And we can make N as large as we want.
2267214	2272060	283	A	0.98	And so they can exchange messages of arbitrary complexity.
2272640	2281580	284	A	1	And if they share the meaning of up and down, then they can exchange these messages with no noise, so they can communicate.
2282260	2294050	285	A	0.58	And we now have our theory of two communicating agents that are that are sharing arbitrary finite information.
2295240	2302550	286	A	0.52437	Now, I've labeled Q one through QN in this picture, a holographic screen.
2303080	2306150	287	A	1	And in fact, that's exactly what it is.
2307900	2313000	288	A	0.8308	Recall from session one this slide illustrating the holographic principle.
2316540	2321470	289	A	0.97703	Shannon made this point that a bit of information is an answer to a yes no question.
2322320	2327916	290	A	0.95	And so we can write down a number of possible states.
2328018	2330220	291	A	0.99997	We can write down an entropy.
2331940	2338844	292	A	0.76	And the limiting case of that entropy is the entropy of a black hole.
2338972	2349300	293	A	1	The densest possible encoding of information in space or on a boundary.
2350520	2360040	294	A	1	And this holographic principle allows us to see any boundary, as we discuss in session one, as an encoding of bits.
2360700	2368010	295	A	0.99974	So the previous boundary of these in qubits, we can think of as a holographic screen.
2368960	2371310	296	A	0.56131	Now, why is that important?
2374640	2402608	297	A	0.86274	It's important because it allows us to use this idea of holography and this idea of a fixed encoding of a message or a fixed encoding of an observable entropy at some density that was developed in cosmology to talk about arbitrary quantum communication channels.
2402704	2414890	298	A	0.99999	So we can import a whole bunch of theory that was done someplace else into quantum information theory and see that it works perfectly because it describes exactly the same situation.
2416620	2418410	299	A	0.99743	Now, what does this tell us?
2419840	2431340	300	A	0.39489	Philosophically, it tells us that Alice and Bob can learn about each other at most N bits per communication cycle.
2432740	2443250	301	A	0.99707	So the maximal amount of information that they can get from an observation is the in bits that the other one wrote on the screen.
2445240	2464200	302	A	0.99512	So this tells us something very important, that when an agent is looking at their environment, which is this other agent, Bob, the amount of information that can be extracted from the environment is actually proportional to the size in bits of the boundary.
2465260	2470910	303	A	1	And the holographic principle just makes that size finite in space.
2471440	2480190	304	A	1	And I said early on that there's no embedding spacetime in this theory, that Alice and Bob are not thought of as separated in space.
2480960	2491360	305	A	0.97759	But as soon as we use the holographic principle, we can think of the boundary between them as having a spatial coordinate, even though they don't have a spatial coordinate.
2492100	2519880	306	A	0.99983	So we'll get back to this point in September when we talk about theories of emergent spacetime, but all of these theories of emergent spacetime come back to this idea that boundaries can have spatial extent, even though the systems that they separate don't have any natural spatial description or natural spatial degrees of freedom.
2522480	2528270	307	A	0.63485	Okay, so now let's recall another picture from session one.
2530640	2557370	308	A	0.99998	We talked a little bit about Feynman's theory of scattering and the origin of Feynman diagrams and the idea that if Alice prepares some system in some initial state and then measures the state later, if we want to calculate what the new state is.
2558140	2568760	309	A	0.99999	We have to take into account all of the possible paths that join the initial state that Alice prepared to the final state that Alice measured.
2570000	2572110	310	A	0.9966	So what does that mean?
2572560	2586770	311	A	0.83	I mean, here effectively, if we think of suppose I'm Alice and the boundary is my screen, I'm talking to the screen, and then later on, I'm going to measure the screen.
2587380	2595510	312	A	0.61	And between my preparation actions and my measurement actions, a bunch of stuff happens on the other side of the screen.
2596760	2605444	313	A	0.7	And if I want to predict what's going to happen on the other side of the screen, I've got to take into account every possible thing.
2605482	2606630	314	A	1	That could happen.
2608040	2613656	315	A	1	And I have to give some weight to those possible things that could happen.
2613758	2625870	316	A	1	And Quantum theory, in fact, tells you how to assign those weights to things that could happen in order to make a measurement, given some theory of the mechanism that makes things happen.
2627040	2632370	317	A	1	But the fact that all of the paths have to be counted is what unitary evolution means.
2633060	2641570	318	A	0.99949	This evolution that preserves information that doesn't take any away, it doesn't add any, it just represents it in different ways.
2642100	2654470	319	A	0.97958	So if you look at this screen and imagine that Alice is interacting with her boundary and then she's interacting with her boundary again, it looks just like the previous screen.
2654840	2659800	320	A	0.53	And the wavy red arrows are what's happening inside Bob.
2660540	2671630	321	A	1	The wavy red arrows are a representation of what's going on inside Bob as he measures his side of the screen and then prepares his side of the screen.
2672320	2684370	322	A	0.9998	So what Feynman is representing here is just the action of the environment or the action of the system while Alice isn't looking.
2684980	2693040	323	A	0.99999	Between Alice's preparation stage and her measurement stage, while Bob is doing his measurement and preparation.
2693780	2696832	324	A	0.99984	So this diagram is actually completely symmetrical.
2696896	2704896	325	A	0.99999	We could have drawn an arrow where the wavy red things are and drawn wavy red things where we talked about Alice.
2705008	2708410	326	A	0.75	And we'd have the same picture just from Bob's point of view.
2709260	2722830	327	A	0.92322	We can also think of this, of course, as Alice communicating with her future self by writing a memory record someplace in the world and then coming back and reading it.
2723680	2739650	328	A	1	And if Alice writes a memory on the world and then comes back later on and reads it, she actually has to take into account some theory of all of the things the world might have done to her memory while she wasn't looking.
2741460	2746660	329	A	0.9999	So this picture of Feynman's actually tells us a lot about memory.
2747400	2762952	330	A	1	And when we think about organisms running around in the world doing things like we do all the time, we tend to think of memories as things that are persistent and unchanging and all of that.
2763006	2764890	331	A	0.99998	But we know that that's not true.
2765340	2768730	332	A	0.93184	We know that memories degrade in various ways.
2769600	2781340	333	A	0.95	We know that adversarial third parties can come and change what we've done so that they fool us into thinking that we've remembered something that we haven't.
2781700	2783600	334	A	0.97	And so on and so forth.
2784260	2796740	335	A	0.99611	That whole picture of memory is actually encoded in this picture that Feynman drew in the late fifty S to represent scattering of particles.
2800680	2807030	336	A	0.99985	So what we've done here is started with this simple idea of asking questions.
2808060	2812164	337	A	1	And we've actually constructed a fair amount of Quantum theory.
2812212	2816628	338	A	0.99994	We constructed the Schrodinger equation, we constructed the unitary propagator.
2816724	2824700	339	A	0.79367	We constructed the idea of a reference frame, which we'll talk about intensely next time in July.
2825760	2832370	340	A	0.99997	So we can sum this up by saying that Quantum theory simply is a theory of communicating agents.
2833300	2854704	341	A	1	And that quantum mechanics, the theory that Feynman was complaining about in that earlier slide, that quantum mechanics generates this problem that seems intractable of how to understand measurement, because the theory is in fact about measurement.
2854832	2857690	342	A	0.71575	It's not about mechanical motion at all.
2858460	2862920	343	A	0.78922	So quantum theory actually tells us nothing about ontology.
2864300	2875912	344	A	1	And this is why the interpretations of quantum theory, the many worlds interpretation, where you have all these branching universes and so forth, are not really science.
2875976	2877112	345	A	0.59231	They're philosophy.
2877176	2885788	346	A	0.58565	They're attempts to understand an ontology that's generated by a theory that doesn't talk about ontology.
2885884	2888850	347	A	0.93769	It talks about communication between agents.
2889780	2892528	348	A	0.99999	But we've left something very important out.
2892694	2900070	349	A	0.98419	We've left out a consideration of what happens when Alice and Bob don't mean the same thing by up and down.
2900760	2910136	350	A	1	And we've left out the famous phenomenon of entanglement spooky action at a distance, as Einstein called it.
2910238	2914680	351	A	1	And it turns out these things that we've left out are very, very closely related.
2916060	2919604	352	A	0.94	And we're going to see why in July.
2919732	2922604	353	A	0.72036	But I'm going to give you a brief preview now.
2922802	2928284	354	A	0.57171	So what happens when Alice and Bob actually mean different things by up and down?
2928482	2931660	355	A	0.99416	What if their reference frames aren't aligned?
2932880	2937680	356	A	0.99997	Well, the first thing to note is that nothing in the theory says they have to be aligned.
2938180	2941490	357	A	0.99992	So we have to consider the possibility that they're not.
2942420	2949040	358	A	1	And in fact, both Alice and Bob have to have what's called free choice of reference frame.
2949200	2957560	359	A	0.99999	When Alice prepares her instrument, she has to be able to prepare it any way she wants to in order to do an experiment.
2959020	2971710	360	A	1	And when Bob makes up a sentence to tell Alice, he has to be able to choose any language he wants to use, he's a free agent in this way.
2972080	2975544	361	A	1	And if they don't have that freedom, it turns out they're entangled.
2975672	2981900	362	A	0.99976	So reference frame, nonalignment and entanglement are very, very closely coupled.
2984420	2991120	363	A	0.93762	Now, misalignment of reference frames is what produces superpositions of outcomes.
2991940	3014776	364	A	0.6013	So if Alice makes her measurements with her up and down arrow arranged vertically, for example, but Bob prepares his qubit with his up and down arrow arranged at 90 degrees to Alice's, alice is not going to have any idea what Bob did.
3014958	3018820	365	A	0.81	I mean, she can't see distinctions in the left right direction.
3018900	3022380	366	A	1	She can only see distinctions in the up and down direction.
3022880	3025580	367	A	0.99984	So all she can do is flip a coin.
3026080	3036608	368	A	0.9979	If she wants to know what Bob prepared, it's 50% likely he prepared up for her what she calls one.
3036774	3041088	369	A	1	And it's 50% likely that he prepared what's down for her.
3041174	3042370	370	A	0.51818	She can't tell.
3044040	3049744	371	A	0.98435	Now, if Bob's reference frame is pointing at about 45 degrees.
3049872	3057690	372	A	0.67448	So up for him means 45 degrees off of Alice's up, then she can sort of tell what he did.
3058300	3066010	373	A	0.53086	If he's pointing 45 degrees from up, then she's probably going to measure up.
3066460	3071230	374	A	1	And if he's pointing 45 degrees from down, she's probably going to measure down.
3071600	3077420	375	A	0.99997	So her outcomes are 75% for one and 25% for minus one.
3077490	3081660	376	A	1	If he prepares at this 45 degree angle.
3082260	3084624	377	A	0.99991	So we can write this in a particular way.
3084662	3106368	378	A	0.99995	We can say that the value that Alice gets acting with her M on a qubit that Bob prepared is some number times what she measures as up plus some other number plus times what she measures as minus one, where those numbers, the squares of those numbers, add to one.
3106554	3108344	379	A	0.81461	So why do they have to add to one?
3108462	3111720	380	A	0.87398	Well, they add to one because of the Pythagorean theorem.
3114300	3120540	381	A	1	One is the distance, the total distance between the two outcomes.
3121360	3127740	382	A	1	And A squared plus B squared are the other two sides of that triangle.
3128480	3146256	383	A	0.80001	So another way to think of it is that the metric distance in possibility space is one and A squared and B squared are just the Euclidean distance components.
3146288	3149936	384	A	0.9612	Again, Euclidean distance is based on the Pythagorean theorem.
3150128	3153060	385	A	0.99986	So this is the Born rule in quantum theory.
3154120	3162490	386	A	0.99944	It's the rule that tells us what happens when we're trying to measure a superposition and it tells us where these superpositions come from.
3164220	3170140	387	A	1	We have a mismatch in reference frames between two agents that are communicating.
3172480	3189330	388	A	0.99979	So if we go back to the free energy principle, which is what this whole active inference class is about, and we formulate it in quantum theory, we get a very simple idea of what the free energy principle is.
3189940	3201910	389	A	1	The FEP and quantum theory just says that interacting systems are going to behave in a way that aligns their reference frames and that makes their communication as good as it can be.
3203640	3217160	390	A	0.99957	But since aligning reference frames perfectly leads to entanglement, the free energy principle drives systems asymptotically toward entanglement.
3219360	3226540	391	A	0.66109	Well, the principle of unitarity says that all systems will approach entanglement asymptotically.
3226960	3232540	392	A	0.99999	So we can see the FEP is actually a classical statement of the principle of unitarity.
3233540	3249860	393	A	0.89	And what we'll see in the next session is why this is the case, why active inference, when we think of it, quantum mechanically is a way of talking about the principle of unitarity, which is the deepest axiom of quantum theory.
3250840	3265320	394	A	1	And we'll also see that this question of alignment becomes more and more complex as the complexity of the messages that the systems are trying to communicate to each other increases.
3266220	3270860	395	A	0.8	And that message complexity correlates with system complexity.
3271440	3279950	396	A	0.99984	So that aligning complicated systems is very hard, although aligning very simple systems is fairly easy.
3280480	3293410	397	A	0.67	And if you think about what's the simplest possible theory in science, it's particle physics, because you're dealing with these very simple things that interact in extremely simple ways.
3294120	3306752	398	A	0.53	And the really difficult parts of science are things like sociology, where you're dealing with incredibly complicated systems like humans that interact in incredibly complicated ways.
3306906	3312250	399	A	0.9	And all we have are very vague kind of folk theories of how that works.
3313180	3319370	400	A	0.99998	But we know from that example that aligning complex systems is extremely difficult.
3321580	3324030	401	A	0.70094	So humans don't get along very well.
3325600	3334610	402	A	0.99364	So the second session well, the second discussion section which Andrew will be leading is on Saturday, the 1 July, a couple of weeks from now.
3335540	3361780	403	A	1	The third lecture session will be on July 13 and I hope you all will contribute to the interactive question and answer session on the web and show up for the discussion on Saturday, the 1 July and join us again in July for the discussion of quantum reference frames and reference frame alignment.
3361940	3363530	404	A	0.99323	So thank you very much.
3368970	3370470	405	B	0.99853	Thank you, Chris.
3372170	3372790	406	C	0.66911	All right.
