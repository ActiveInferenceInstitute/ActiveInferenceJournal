New approach to physics is entirely topological.	Daniel Field: Welcome to lecture two of physics as Information Processing	Quantum Physics
175500	462870	02:55	Quantum theory makes the idea of physics as a theory of communication simple and obvious. To ask a simple question, we need three things: an action, a shared language and a binary answer. That formal representation is in fact quantum theory.

465240	888290	07:45	Action is always required when there's some interaction or two way action between systems. A concept of a minimum action needed to ask a question, and specifically a question with a binary answer. Planck's constant represents the minimum energy times time or action.	Action is always required when there's some interaction between systems	Quantum mechanics 8, Action and Time
889860	1646512	14:49	We want to have a theory of asking very simple questions. We're developing the notation of quantum theory. The third thing that we have to build into this picture is the shared language. It's a physical object that encodes a concept or a meaning.

We can now see where that energy is coming from in this simple, stripped down representation of an action. It tells us that this equivalent expression, e to the minus beta M, is also a wave equation. It has built into it some sense of time.	H is the total energy operator on a system	Quantum Mechanics 2, The exponential propagator
1994280	2054230	33:14	Every preparation is a measurement, and every measurement is a preparation. How can the agent tell the difference or break the symmetry between preparation and measurement? Are they just completely dual pictures?	Every preparation is a measurement, and every measurement is a preparation	Quantum duality of preparation and measurement
2057420	2519880	34:17	Alice and Bob can interact using any finite number of qubits. This is a noiseless channel because they just have one qubit that they're interacting with. The holographic principle allows us to see any boundary as an encoding of bits.	We've developed a theory to describe the interaction between Alice and Bob	Quantum communication channels, the holographic principle
2522480	2922604	42:02	Quantum theory simply is a theory of communicating agents. It's not about mechanical motion at all. So quantum theory actually tells us nothing about ontology. This is why the interpretations of quantum theory are not really science.	Quantum theory is a theory of communicating agents	Quantum Mechanics, the law of measurement and control
2922802	3363530	48:42	Both Alice and Bob have to have what's called free choice of reference frame. If they don't have that freedom, it turns out they're entangled. Misalignment of reference frames is what produces superpositions of outcomes. And we'll also see that this question of alignment becomes more and more complex as complexity increases.	What happens when Alice and Bob's reference frames aren't aligned	What if Alice and Bob Don't Align Their Reference Frames?
