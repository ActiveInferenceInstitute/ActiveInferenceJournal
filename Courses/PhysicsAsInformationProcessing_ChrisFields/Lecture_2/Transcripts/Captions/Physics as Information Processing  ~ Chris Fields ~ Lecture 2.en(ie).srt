1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,040
foreign

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,519
it's June 15 2023 we are here in lecture

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,000
two of Chris Fields course physics as

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,279
information processing so thank you

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,960
Chris looking forward to the lecture

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,060
oh thank you Daniel

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,640
um and yes welcome to this session

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,480
uh this section is titled why quantum

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,340
physics

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,399
and if you will recall from the first

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,660
session

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,840
we reviewed the history of physics and

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,520
and some of the history of mathematics

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,620
and computer science

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,780
or I'll

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,059
the end from the end of the 19th century

17
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,820
through to the beginning of the 21st

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,379
Century

19
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,320
and discuss the the slow development

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,260
from classical thermodynamics

21
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,260
of quantum information Theory

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,740
and uh specifically characterizing

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,580
Quantum information Theory

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,520
as a new kind of physics

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,340
that

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,380
describes systems that are exchanging

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,520
finite amounts of discreetly encoded

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,960
information

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,100
across some intervening boundary and

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,299
so we use this very conventional

31
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,740
graphical notation

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,979
of two agents or physical systems

33
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,840
Alice and Bob A and B

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,979
that are exchanging energy and

35
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,840
information

36
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,720
across some boundary and I always use a

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,060
blue ellipse like this to indicate the

38
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,500
boundary that separates Alice from Bob

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,960
and this new approach to

40
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,840
physics is entirely topological it's not

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,340
geometric

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,980
so it doesn't assume a particular

43
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,140
background space time

44
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,780
so it doesn't assume that Alice and Bob

45
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,620
are spatially separated

46
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,879
and so this this makes it a very

47
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,459
different kind of theory from classical

48
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,319
information Theory

49
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,739
in that the channel uh that separates

50
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,560
Alice from Bob this boundary

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,099
is a boundary in state space it's not a

52
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,459
boundary in some geometric embedding

53
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,459
space and in particular it's not a

54
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,459
boundary or a channel that's embedded in

55
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,560
a three-dimensional space that separates

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,459
Alice from Bob

57
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,780
that's what we talked about last time

58
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,680
and today what I want to discuss is how

59
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,000
quantum

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,260
theory in particular

61
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,540
makes this idea of physics is a theory

62
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,579
of communication simple than obvious and

63
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,280
quantum theory of course has a terrible

64
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,080
reputation

65
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,860
uh of being abstruse and mathematically

66
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,940
incredibly complicated and

67
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,019
counter-intuitive and difficult to

68
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,480
understand

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,580
and this is one quotation among many

70
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,700
of from leading physicists pointing out

71
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,920
that that quantum mechanics is just

72
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,780
difficult

73
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,459
and uh as as you probably know there's

74
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,799
an entire

75
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,540
philosophical industry of

76
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,060
interpretations of quantum theory

77
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,340
that try to make sense of its ontology

78
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,040
and

79
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,120
so what I don't want to do today is try

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,840
to introduce quantum mechanics

81
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,180
uh we're not doing uh any of this

82
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,100
some of you will recognize this as the

83
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,320
table of contents the first part of the

84
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,620
table of contents of the famous textbook

85
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,020
by Landau and lift sheds

86
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,100
oh but if you've studied quantum theory

87
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,860
in undergraduate or graduate school

88
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,900
you've probably dealt with a textbook

89
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,139
structured much like this one and you've

90
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,180
probably been introduced to quantum

91
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,520
mechanics as it was traditionally

92
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,419
conceived as essentially a mechanical

93
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,000
Theory a theory of motion

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,960
uh with wave functions and and particle

95
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,080
representations and on and on and on

96
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,180
so we're not going to try to do that

97
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,540
this uh what we're going to do instead

98
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,900
is take a completely

99
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,540
information theoretic approach

100
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,840
uh and we're going to characterize

101
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,080
um information transfer in a Quantum

102
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,600
theoretic way without any assumptions

103
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,240
about mechanics or space-time or any of

104
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,040
that

105
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,600
so instead of this

106
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,180
we're going to ask a simple question

107
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,000
uh a simple by a simple question I mean

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,360
a question with just a yes no answer or

109
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,220
a binary answer so let's use up or down

110
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,360
as our example question

111
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
and to ask this question we need three

112
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,300
things

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,120
first we need an action we need a way of

114
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,460
asking it

115
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,759
uh for example making a sound or writing

116
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,419
something down

117
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,060
um second we need to a thing that we can

118
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,520
ask the question of

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,240
uh we need an environment or a friend or

120
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,759
the rest of the world or an experimental

121
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,460
apparatus

122
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,220
or some system or other that we're going

123
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,180
to act on to ask this question

124
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,240
and the third thing that we need to to

125
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,539
ask this question is a shared language

126
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,759
and it's the shared language that's

127
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,819
often neglected in in

128
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,539
models based in physics

129
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,580
um and I think the importance of the

130
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,620
shared language was became clear and

131
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,020
classical information Theory and it's

132
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,000
it's become clear again of course in

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,580
Quantum information Theory but this has

134
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,759
only happened over the last few decades

135
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,780
so what I want to do today is to

136
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,500
construct in a step-by-step fashion a

137
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,900
formal representation of these three

138
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,759
things that we need

139
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,860
to ask a simple question

140
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,919
and what we'll find is that that formal

141
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,560
representation is in fact quantum theory

142
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,060
so it's quantum theory that provides us

143
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,620
with a formal representation of asking

144
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,199
these simple binary questions and of

145
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,960
course if you can ask a binary question

146
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,240
you can ask any finite number of binary

147
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,620
questions so you can construct and

148
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,660
arbitrarily complex finite decision tree

149
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,900
that ends up formulating

150
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,199
an arbitrary an arbitrarily complex but

151
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,120
still finite question

152
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,160
so this really is a general model of

153
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,240
communicative interactions between

154
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,840
agents

155
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,020
so let's go about this and and talk

156
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,599
first about the action of asking a

157
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,520
question and so the first thing I want

158
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,840
you to do is is actually say out loud

159
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,400
up or down

160
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,720
actually

161
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,919
ask a question

162
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,500
and then note two things about what just

163
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,000
happened

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,639
uh the first thing to note is that it

165
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,460
took some time to do that that that

166
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,440
action actually we required to find that

167
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,360
amount of time

168
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,440
um

169
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,960
a couple of seconds not very long

170
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,919
but it's not zero it it always takes

171
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,979
time to ask a question

172
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:30,599
and the second thing to note is that it

173
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,099
took energy

174
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,399
to to actually say up or down

175
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,880
it requires a little bit of exertion

176
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,360
to ask a question

177
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,760
so let's put those two together

178
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,700
and Define a word we're going to define

179
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,800
the word action

180
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,100
to mean some energy that's spent in some

181
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,880
time

182
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,240
so asking a question is an action

183
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,720
and it qualifies as an action because it

184
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,420
requires spending some energy in some

185
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,160
finite amount of time

186
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,260
and so we can write this as action

187
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,440
equals energy times time or I'll

188
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,300
sometimes use the abbreviation E times t

189
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,080
um

190
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,740
and

191
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,320
action is is always required when when

192
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,600
there's some interaction

193
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,240
or two-way action

194
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,060
between systems so whenever we talk

195
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,000
about physical interaction we're always

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,760
talking about two systems doing

197
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,800
something to each other

198
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,959
that requires both energy and time

199
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,660
so let's define another concept a

200
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,420
concept of a minimum action needed to

201
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,820
ask a question and specifically a

202
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,940
question with a binary answer

203
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,760
and we'll just pick a symbol to stand

204
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,060
for that minimum action and the symbol

205
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,240
we'll use because it's conventional as h

206
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,760
and it turns out that this h

207
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,060
is Planck's constant the number that

208
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,160
Planck came up with

209
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,080
when he was trying to solve the black

210
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,320
body problem back in 1900 that we talked

211
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,820
about last time

212
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,399
and recall that was the problem of

213
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,240
characterizing the spectrum of radiation

214
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,820
emitted by some physical system that was

215
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,839
hot

216
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,000
how much energy comes out as a function

217
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,620
of temperature

218
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,160
and if you assume that the spectrum of

219
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,680
energy coming out is continuous you get

220
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,540
predictions that are wrong

221
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,060
and plank got predictions that were

222
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,079
correct

223
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,360
by assuming that that Spectrum was

224
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,380
discrete and that that this h

225
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,380
uh represented the minimum amount of

226
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,779
energy that could be emitted in a

227
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,300
particular time so it represented the

228
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,140
minimum energy times time or action

229
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,160
so let's look at an example of that

230
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,420
and here's an example that may be

231
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,240
familiar it's the example of your own

232
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,540
visual system

233
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,899
so in the retinal

234
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:20,940
the cells of your retinas

235
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,920
uh there are many many molecules that

236
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,839
are rhodopsins of one variety or other

237
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,519
that respond to different wavelengths of

238
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,620
visible light

239
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,560
and they have some efficiency for

240
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,300
capturing light

241
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,060
and let's just assume that they're

242
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,100
optimally efficient that there is

243
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,220
efficient as they could possibly be

244
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,980
and that means that they require the

245
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,779
minimum amount of energy

246
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,079
to change shape which is what they do

247
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,779
when they're impacted by light to

248
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,200
capture the the energy and hence the

249
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,880
information that's available in the

250
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,260
light

251
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,440
and the minimum energy to do anything

252
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,920
that records one bit of information so

253
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,200
yes or no up or down

254
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,459
uh is 0.7 so log 2

255
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,600
um

256
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,200
of of Boltzmann's constant times the

257
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,000
temperature

258
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,560
and again we saw this last time uh this

259
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,620
is from roughly 1875.

260
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,200
and was then built into classical

261
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,140
information Theory

262
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,100
by Shannon and then by landauer uh in

263
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,680
the mid 20th century

264
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,260
so what we're doing is is assuming that

265
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,540
since rhodopson's optimally efficient

266
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,940
all it requires is this amount of energy

267
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,459
to change shape

268
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,260
and it's known experimentally that

269
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,079
rhodopsin takes about 200 femtoseconds

270
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:58,320
to change shape so that's 200 times 10

271
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,560
to the minus 15 seconds so it's a very

272
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,220
very fast reaction chemical reaction

273
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,440
so we can just calculate what the action

274
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,519
is

275
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,399
and at 37 degrees Centigrade so human

276
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,519
body temperature

277
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,579
KT is about 4.3 times 10 to the minus 21

278
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:21,420
Joule my joules just the standard unit

279
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,899
of energy

280
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,120
and so we can multiply everything

281
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,500
together

282
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,820
um

283
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,540
KT times 0.7 times this response time of

284
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,760
200 femtoseconds

285
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,139
of

286
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,800
multiplied together gives you an action

287
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,100
of about 6 times 10 to the minus 34

288
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,899
Joule seconds

289
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,940
and if you're familiar with quantum

290
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,680
mechanics you'll instantly recognize

291
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,620
that number because it's very close to

292
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,560
the value of Planck's constant uh which

293
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,320
is 6.6 times 10 to the minus 34 Joule

294
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,079
seconds so this says that rhodopsin is

295
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,139
very near to Optimal

296
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,940
um the the best it would be able to do

297
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,519
would be Planck's constant that's the

298
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,660
minimum action that can be undertaken

299
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,660
um so rhodopsin is clearly doing very

300
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,040
well it can't be as efficient as we're

301
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,720
assuming it to be

302
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,220
uh but it's pretty efficient

303
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,420
so this number Planck's constant is and

304
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,880
this idea of a minimum action is not

305
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,040
something we just pulled out of the air

306
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,860
it's something that one can observe when

307
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,560
you're looking at what real biological

308
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,079
systems in particular do in other

309
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,339
physical systems too

310
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:52,260
so let's think about the the second

311
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,620
component of of this

312
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,079
project of asking a question and that's

313
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,899
the thing to be asked

314
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,880
and we want to ask a very simple

315
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,339
question we want to have a theory of

316
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,380
asking very simple questions

317
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,880
so let's define the simplest thing that

318
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,720
we can ask a binary question too

319
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,060
and let's say this is the thing that we

320
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,360
can ask a binary question of using just

321
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,760
this minimum action h

322
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,800
so we're going to ask for the minimal

323
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,740
thing that it's possible physically to

324
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,660
ask a question of

325
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,760
and this thing needs a name so let's

326
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,180
call it a qubit and that word is a

327
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,420
contraction or Quantum bit

328
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,279
and we can draw it like this a little

329
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,500
sphere with an arrow through it Ah

330
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,019
that's called a block sphere

331
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,320
and we use this symbol q and that

332
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,139
notation with the bar and the angle

333
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:53,160
bracket

334
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,959
uh

335
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,320
is called a bra notation and it

336
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,680
originates with Dirac so it's a

337
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,160
traditional way of writing inner

338
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,750
products actually in quantum theory

339
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,060
[Music]

340
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,440
um

341
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,440
to indicate the state of Q

342
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,740
so we'll we'll this this thing called a

343
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,860
qubit uh only responds to Binary

344
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,980
questions so it clearly can have only

345
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,440
two states the state that answers yes

346
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,839
and the state that answers no

347
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,199
and conventionally we we draw the arrow

348
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,899
going up if the answer is yes and the

349
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,480
arrow going down if the answer is no

350
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,120
and so those are the two states that the

351
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,899
qubit can be in when it's answered a

352
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,639
question

353
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,600
so now let's draw a picture for the act

354
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,720
of asking a question of Q in the state q

355
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,060
and let's draw it like this

356
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,920
uh this curviero is the action of asking

357
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,279
the question and getting the answer back

358
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,199
and we're asking it of this minimum

359
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,299
system the qubit

360
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:12,179
and let's call this this entire Act of H

361
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,500
and right at H acting on Q by this

362
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,660
expression HQ

363
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,179
so again we're developing the the

364
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,540
notation of quantum theory which uh all

365
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,799
of you who

366
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,839
know the theory already will find

367
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,379
familiar

368
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,059
so the third thing that we have to to

369
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,400
build into this picture and into the

370
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,480
theory

371
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,539
is the shared language

372
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:45,419
so we have to know uh what we mean by up

373
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,400
or down if we're going to ask the

374
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,940
question up or down

375
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,760
and we have to I'll have some

376
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,860
representation of of

377
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,740
what it means for the qubit to

378
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,660
distinguish up or down

379
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,539
so let's say that to us

380
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,340
oh

381
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,760
up and down mean this little diagram

382
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,539
with an arrow that's labeled up on one

383
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,299
end and down on the other end so we're

384
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,940
defining up and down in a very simple

385
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,760
way as just opposites we don't know

386
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,620
anything else about them except that

387
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,179
they're opposites

388
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,880
so this is a stripped down one bit

389
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,100
question we could have called them one

390
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,740
and minus one we could have called them

391
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,360
A and B we could have called them

392
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,380
anything

393
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,080
uh we're just indicating that up and

394
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,220
down are two opposing Concepts

395
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,940
and so this object that we've used to

396
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,160
make this definition

397
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,799
of the relationship between our two

398
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,660
words up and down

399
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,240
is called a reference frame

400
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,179
uh it's it's a

401
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,480
a physical object

402
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,020
that encodes a concept or a meaning

403
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,320
and if you think about using language

404
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,660
using English for example you can

405
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,780
understand me speaking in English

406
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,840
uh because your brain has the right

407
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,860
sorts of neural circuits to allow you to

408
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,620
understand English and produce English

409
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,799
uh using your your hand in your mouth

410
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,860
and those neural circuits are reference

411
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,580
frames in your brain uh for

412
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,220
understanding and producing English and

413
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,200
they encode the relationships between

414
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
different words

415
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,100
so you all know about chat GPT you can

416
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,380
think of all of the weights on

417
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,280
uh all of the 10 to the

418
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,720
19th or however many parameters there

419
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,340
are in gpd4

420
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,440
as a reference frame

421
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,840
that describes the relationships between

422
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,900
words and phrases in English and many

423
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,400
other languages

424
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,919
so this idea of a reference frame

425
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,780
is an instance of of Land hours

426
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,360
principle which is is often summarized

427
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,059
as saying that information is physical

428
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:17,220
what that means is that information

429
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,880
always has to have some encoding

430
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,340
and that encoding that object

431
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,020
can always be thought of as a reference

432
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,940
frame

433
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,679
so let's put all this stuff together

434
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,140
what we have now is a reference frame

435
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,539
that defines the difference between up

436
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,179
and down we have an action that we've

437
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:43,799
labeled h

438
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:47,760
and the action acts on this object of

439
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,020
the qubit

440
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,500
uh which is in some state

441
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,100
and what we've drawn here now is an

442
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,600
experiment

443
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,539
and you can think of the incoming part

444
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,760
of the arrow that goes from the

445
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,340
reference frame to the qubit

446
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,179
as a preparation of the qubit so you can

447
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,640
think of it as I'm doing something to

448
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,340
the qubit to put it in a particular

449
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,340
State like up

450
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,039
because that's the state I want it to be

451
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,780
in

452
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,299
and I can think of this returning part

453
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,100
of the arrow

454
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,100
as a measurement of the state that the

455
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,500
qubit is actually in

456
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,679
so if the qubit's actually in this state

457
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,539
with Europe pointing up

458
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,580
uh then I'm going to get back the answer

459
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,120
up when I act on the qubit to measure

460
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,460
its state

461
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,419
so now we can recognize this this action

462
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:50,840
h

463
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,880
as

464
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,460
the hamiltonian operator in quantum

465
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,480
theory

466
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,380
which always takes some time

467
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,840
which we represent by an interval DT

468
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,539
to act on some State and in particular

469
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,140
this binary state q so this is this

470
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,960
whole picture depicts the action of a

471
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,000
very simple hamiltonian operator

472
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,220
um and again I want to emphasize that

473
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,559
we've just defined the qubit as the

474
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,659
simplest thing that we can ask a binary

475
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,799
question of

476
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,980
so how does this H work

477
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,860
uh we can use h

478
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,799
to prepare this qubit in one of two

479
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,140
states which we're going to label one

480
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,760
and minus one

481
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,980
of the state one

482
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,039
uh corresponds to the up Direction

483
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,919
and the State minus 1 corresponds to the

484
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,200
down Direction

485
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,400
and

486
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,659
doing this to Q so preparing Q in one of

487
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,480
these two states takes energy

488
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,480
and we know how much uh boltzmann told

489
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,020
us back in 1875 that the minimum energy

490
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,720
to reduce the the entropy of the

491
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,539
universe by one bit

492
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:16,799
is log 2 of KT we saw that earlier when

493
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,980
we were thinking about rhodopsin so we

494
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,980
can say that acting with h always

495
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,659
requires some number times KT where that

496
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:30,120
number is bigger than the log of 2. and

497
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,340
remember the log of 2 is just in there

498
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,080
to get units of bits of binary questions

499
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,640
uh as opposed to units of gnats which

500
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,559
are questions that have

501
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,320
e answers where e is the exponential

502
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,260
base the natural exponential base but we

503
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,659
want to use units of bits so we have to

504
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,620
always have this factor of log 2.

505
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,980
so this lets us write H in a particular

506
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,580
way we can take out this this energetic

507
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,559
term

508
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,600
that vaultzmann tells us we have to

509
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,980
include uh beta times KT

510
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,100
and what's left over is is in a sense

511
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,159
the pure representation of the action

512
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,100
stripping out the energy requirement

513
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,580
and we're going to call that M because m

514
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,220
is the standard

515
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,020
symbol to use in quantum theory for a

516
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,539
measurement operator

517
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:38,400
and M is is now dimensionless H uh has

518
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,299
units of energy KT

519
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,900
is in energy

520
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,780
and M has no units at all so it's h

521
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,880
without the energy

522
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,580
so now we can ask what is this operator

523
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,539
M that we've defined as the the simplest

524
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,580
possible

525
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,679
action on a qubit but abstracting away

526
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,659
the amount of energy that we have to use

527
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,720
to act on the qubit

528
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,220
well what M does is just encode a bit or

529
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,799
decode a bit

530
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,820
so we can use this operator M to say uh

531
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,600
I want Q to have the value 1 I want it

532
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,779
to be up so I can sort of reach out with

533
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:28,260
my operator M and grab q and turn it so

534
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,559
that its arrow is pointing up

535
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,799
and that's what the the operation that's

536
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,840
called preparation in physics it's what

537
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,120
it means to prepare an experimental

538
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,279
apparatus for example you you actually

539
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,320
grab hold of the apparatus and you twist

540
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,020
some knobs and flick some switches to

541
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,380
prepare it to be in some state

542
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,679
and you can use M to measure a state

543
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,120
that isn't known so I can

544
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,080
use M to grab a hold of Q and look at it

545
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,559
and determine whether it's in state 1 or

546
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,120
-1

547
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,000
and I can represent these as just a

548
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,980
cycle that starts with measuring and

549
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,200
then prepares or that starts with

550
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,779
preparing and then measuring

551
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,299
and if I represent it that way

552
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:22,020
uh what I see is is m

553
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,500
having a value which is either the value

554
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,960
I want to encode or the value that I

555
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,500
have measured and Q

556
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,159
and M acts on that value and Q to

557
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,299
produce a particular state of Q to put Q

558
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,880
in a particular state or to realize that

559
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Q is in that state

560
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,559
and so m is actually an identity

561
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:54,059
acting on some value and Q so it Maps

562
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,659
one and Q to 1 and Q and it Maps minus 1

563
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,480
and Q two minus 1 and Q

564
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,419
if you do the whole cycle of preparation

565
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,640
and then measurement and that makes

566
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,340
sense it's actually an axiom in some

567
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,500
formulations of quantum theory

568
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,279
that if I measure the state of some

569
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,600
object

570
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,480
what I'm doing is also preparing it in

571
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,940
that state so if I immediately measure

572
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,659
it again I'll see the same value

573
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,900
and that makes sense physically if I you

574
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,779
know put my coffee cup on the table and

575
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,880
then I look for it it's likely going to

576
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,559
be on the table unless something else

577
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,299
intervenes

578
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,039
well what does this mean it means that

579
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:41,760
we can do a little bit of algebra

580
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,900
um

581
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,960
it means that we can write this original

582
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,640
expression

583
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,779
of acting on cue with our hamiltonian in

584
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,720
this somewhat more explicit form of

585
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,720
using the energy beta KT

586
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,440
and our operator M on Q

587
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,640
and what I get out of that is the energy

588
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,620
beta KT multiplied by Q

589
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,159
so HQ equals EQ

590
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,620
that's the Schrodinger equation

591
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,539
so that's one of the central equations

592
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:21,720
of quantum theory what it says is that

593
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,820
this operator h

594
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,960
is the total energy operator on a system

595
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,380
its eigenvalues are the total energies

596
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,580
of the system

597
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,700
and we can now see where that energy is

598
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,039
coming from in this very very simple

599
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,840
strip down

600
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,679
kind of of representation of an action

601
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,020
the energy is the thermodynamic energy

602
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,679
that has to be spent to determine one

603
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,880
binary

604
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,620
outcome up or down

605
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,299
now if you're familiar with quantum

606
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,720
mechanics uh you will have seen

607
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,600
exponentiated operators uh like the the

608
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,980
next line here of algebra

609
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,640
this operator P which is time dependent

610
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,200
and which is the exponential of H

611
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,880
uh multiplied by i t over H bar

612
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,340
is called the propagator it's the

613
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,980
unitary operator in quantum theory the

614
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,740
operator that conserves probability or

615
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,940
conserves information

616
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,520
and so

617
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,580
using the representation of H

618
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,360
as beta KT we can see that that this

619
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,799
operator p is just e to the minus beta m

620
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,159
uh if we recall the wick rotation from

621
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,539
the first session

622
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,960
of this strange equivalence of i t over

623
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,620
H bar with 1 over KT that wasn't

624
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,320
discovered until 50 years after the

625
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,860
invention of quantum theory

626
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,539
um and that's still a very debated uh

627
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,760
thing I mean people worry about what

628
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,580
this what this equation really means

629
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,740
but one thing that it means in this

630
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,620
setting where H has this particularly

631
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,120
simple form

632
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,659
is that the propagator is now just

633
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:28,140
the exponential of a number multiplied

634
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,840
by this very simple strip down operator

635
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,700
that

636
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,140
um

637
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,100
encodes a bit or decodes a bit

638
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,720
but we know something about the

639
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,580
exponential propagator just by looking

640
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,640
at its form if you're again familiar

641
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,320
with these sorts of exponential

642
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,120
operators you know that they're wave

643
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,700
equations

644
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,220
and we can make sense of that using the

645
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,600
diagram up above what m is doing is just

646
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,580
performing a cycle

647
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,659
uh it's just mapping 1 and Q back to

648
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,100
itself

649
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,360
or minus 1 and Q back to itself so we

650
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,120
can think of of M

651
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,760
as just taking this object and flipping

652
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,740
it back around until it's uh

653
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,640
until it gets itself again

654
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,500
and that kind of cycle can always be

655
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,320
turned into a wave equation

656
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,179
and e to the I over H Bar times h t is a

657
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:39,299
canonical form of a wave equation where

658
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,539
the the horizontal axis here on the wave

659
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,179
is time or if you look at the little

660
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,279
cycle that I've drawn as a circle with

661
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,919
an arrow it's it's the time of the thing

662
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,240
spinning around like this which

663
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,980
is exactly the same thing as a wave

664
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,679
traveling through time

665
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,600
so that tells us something very

666
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,220
important

667
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,460
it tells us that that this equivalent

668
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,279
expression e to the minus beta m is also

669
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,020
a wave equation

670
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,500
so it tells us that this operator m

671
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,860
has built into it some sense of time

672
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,020
um it's the sense of time of this

673
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,840
prepare measure cycle

674
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,659
and that's implicit in m

675
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:30,120
right we've used the wick rotation to

676
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,480
get rid of the the kind of what what

677
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,120
I'll end up calling the external time T

678
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,240
the objective time t

679
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,100
and we'll see in July uh

680
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:49,020
where this internal time comes from

681
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,080
uh in terms of the wick rotation

682
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,520
but

683
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,279
we can say now that it's an agent

684
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:00,059
specific time it's an internal time

685
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:01,820
reference frame

686
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:06,120
that's built into the our idea of this

687
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,340
system Alice that can act on the world

688
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,799
and it represents the time that's

689
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,100
required to ask this question

690
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,100
okay Chris uh can I ask a question at

691
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,779
this point yes uh so on this slide uh

692
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:23,100
with the operator

693
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,620
um I'm curious that's how can the agent

694
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,480
deploy in the operator m

695
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,860
tell the difference or break the

696
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,419
Symmetry between preparation and

697
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:32,100
measurement

698
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,260
or are they just completely dual

699
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,340
pictures

700
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,059
um

701
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,220
yeah they're completely dual so the

702
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,220
agent the agent never breaks the

703
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,500
Symmetry the agent can't actually

704
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,960
distinguish the act of preparing from

705
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,260
the act of measuring

706
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,120
every preparation is a measurement and

707
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,580
every measurement is a preparation right

708
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,580
that's that's in fact what this Axiom of

709
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,639
of

710
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,760
measuring a state

711
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,980
leaves the particle in the measured

712
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,320
State means right

713
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,320
so yeah mathematically they're duals

714
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,859
thank you

715
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,980
okay so let's let's now use this theory

716
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,379
that we've developed to describe the

717
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,960
interaction between Alice and Bob

718
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,418
and let's think of this situation in

719
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:30,719
which Alice prepares a qubit

720
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,359
that Bob then measures

721
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,879
and then Bob prepares the very same

722
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,719
qubit and that Alice measures it

723
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,899
so Alice acts with her hamiltonian

724
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,020
operator which will label h a

725
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,540
and Bob acts with his hamiltonian

726
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,080
operator that we label HB

727
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,599
and let's say that Alice prepares the

728
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,720
qubit as in-state up

729
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,619
and uh Bob can then measure the qubit in

730
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,760
state up and say oh the qubit is now up

731
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,880
and if Bob then prepares the Cuban State

732
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,200
down

733
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,780
uh Alice can measure the qubit in state

734
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,359
down and say oh the qubit switch from

735
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,119
the up that I prepared to down so Bob

736
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,000
must have prepared it is down

737
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,920
so what's happened here

738
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,839
uh Alice and Bob have actually shared a

739
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,820
bit flip

740
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:34,200
right Alice said uh up and and Bob said

741
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,579
down so

742
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,160
and Alice heard him say down

743
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,619
so they've they've shared this idea of

744
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:41,640
change

745
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,700
by interacting with each other

746
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,880
now this works as long as they mean the

747
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,980
same thing by up and down

748
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,920
so we've implicitly assumed in talking

749
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,680
about them communicating that they both

750
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,040
have this reference frame

751
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,160
that distinguishes up from down

752
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,920
and this is actually a completely

753
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,480
General model

754
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,260
of what I'll call a noiseless one qubit

755
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,440
channel now what does that mean it's

756
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,540
noiseless because there's nothing else

757
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,280
in the picture

758
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,079
right there's nothing else in the

759
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,839
picture that can jiggle the qubit when

760
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,820
else and Bob aren't looking Alice and

761
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,619
Bob are the only systems we're talking

762
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:26,520
about

763
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,400
and they share this qubit and there's

764
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,200
nothing else in the picture so there's

765
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,760
no kind of third party or environment or

766
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,460
heat bath or anything like that that's

767
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,520
going to mess with the qubit

768
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,740
and disrupt their interaction so that's

769
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,099
a noiseless channel and it's a one qubit

770
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,380
channel because they just have one qubit

771
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,060
that they're interacting with and

772
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,820
they're alternately

773
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,240
preparing and measuring at state

774
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,680
now clearly if if they can interact

775
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,140
using one qubit they can interact using

776
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,780
any finite number of qubits

777
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,300
so here's a picture of an in qubit

778
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,380
Channel

779
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,619
that uh Alice and Bob which here I've

780
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:13,380
labeled A and B because I took this

781
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,000
figure from a paper

782
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,640
are sharing

783
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,960
and uh

784
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,500
Alice and Bob both have n operators one

785
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,800
for each of the N qubits that they share

786
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,960
and they just do this prepare and

787
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,660
measurement cycle on all in qubits so

788
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,720
you can think of Alice preparing the in

789
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,660
qubits Bob measuring the in qubits and

790
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,780
then Bob preparing an ALICE measuring

791
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,300
and that allows them to to exchange

792
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,839
in-bit messages and we can make n as

793
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,540
large as we want and so they can

794
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,940
exchange messages of arbitrary

795
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,619
complexity

796
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:55,260
and if they share the meaning of up and

797
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,900
down then they can exchange these

798
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,880
messages with no noise

799
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,220
so they can communicate

800
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,119
and we now have our theory of two

801
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,339
communicating agents

802
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,680
that are that are sharing

803
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,300
arbitrary uh finite information

804
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,960
now I've labeled uh q1 through qn in

805
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,099
this picture uh a holographic screen

806
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:26,760
and in fact that's exactly what it is

807
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,839
I'll recall from Session One this slide

808
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,740
illustrating the holographic principle

809
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,320
um

810
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,880
Shannon made this point that a bit of

811
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,859
information is an answer to a yes no

812
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,240
question

813
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,560
and

814
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,420
so we can

815
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,760
write down a number of possible States

816
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,359
we can write down an entropy

817
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,700
um and

818
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,300
the limiting case of that entropy is the

819
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,000
entropy of a black hole the densest

820
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,300
possible uh

821
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,740
encoding of information

822
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,260
in space

823
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,440
or on a boundary

824
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,099
and this holographic principle allows us

825
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:16,859
to see any boundary as we discuss in

826
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:20,640
session one as an encoding of bits

827
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,720
so the previous boundary of these in

828
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,420
qubits we can think of as a holographic

829
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,800
screen

830
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,940
now

831
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,760
why is that important

832
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,680
um

833
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,460
it's important because it allows us to

834
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,020
use this idea of holography

835
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,200
and this idea of

836
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,800
fixed encoding of a message or a fixed

837
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,160
encoding of an observable entropy

838
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,320
at some density

839
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,500
that was developed in cosmology

840
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,260
to talk about arbitrary Quantum

841
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,720
communication channels so we can import

842
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,060
a whole bunch of theory that was done

843
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,680
someplace else

844
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,079
into Quantum information Theory and see

845
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,780
that it works perfectly because it

846
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,880
describes exactly the same situation

847
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,859
what does this tell us

848
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,599
philosophically

849
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,800
it tells us that Alice and Bob can learn

850
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,660
about each other

851
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:32,599
at most in bits per communication cycle

852
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,940
so the maximal amount of information

853
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,079
that they can get from an observation is

854
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,599
the in bits that the other one wrote on

855
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,020
the screen

856
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,339
so this tells us something very

857
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:49,859
important that when an agent is looking

858
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:52,140
at their environment which is this other

859
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,000
agent Bob

860
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,540
the amount of information that can be

861
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,280
extracted from the environment is

862
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,160
actually proportional to the size in

863
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,280
bits of the boundary

864
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,280
and the holographic principle just makes

865
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,460
that size finite in space

866
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,160
and I said early on that there's no

867
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,680
embedding space time in this theory that

868
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,720
Alice and Bob are not thought of as

869
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,119
separated in space

870
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,920
but as soon as we use the holographic

871
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,020
principle we can think of the boundary

872
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,119
between them as having a spatial

873
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,119
coordinate even though they don't have a

874
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,099
spatial coordinate

875
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:36,119
so uh we'll get back to this point in

876
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,700
September when we talk about theories of

877
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,460
emergent SpaceTime but all of these

878
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,220
theories of emergent space-time come

879
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,940
back to this idea that boundaries can

880
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,880
have spatial extent even though the

881
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,980
systems that they separate don't have

882
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,300
any natural spatial description or

883
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,839
natural spatial degrees of freedom

884
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,400
okay

885
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,500
so

886
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,140
now let's recall another picture from

887
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,880
Session One

888
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,680
uh

889
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,980
we talked a little bit about

890
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,380
feynman's theory of scattering

891
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,339
and the the origin of Feynman diagrams

892
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:25,680
and the idea that if Alice prepares some

893
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,880
system in some initial state

894
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,720
and then measures the state later

895
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,359
if we want to calculate what the new

896
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:38,099
state is

897
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,800
we have to take into account all of the

898
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,660
possible paths

899
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,060
that join the initial state that Alice

900
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,640
prepared to the final state that Ellis

901
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,920
measured

902
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,500
so what does that mean

903
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,079
I mean here effectively if we think of

904
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:58,920
suppose I'm Alice and the boundary is my

905
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,560
screen

906
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,260
I'm talking to the screen

907
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,119
and then later on I'm going to measure

908
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:07,440
the screen

909
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,520
and between my preparation actions and

910
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,380
my measurement actions a bunch of stuff

911
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,740
happens on the other side of the screen

912
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,859
and if I want to predict what's going to

913
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:22,260
happen on the other side of the screen

914
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,780
I've got to take into account every

915
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,900
possible thing that could happen

916
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,619
and uh I have to give some weight to

917
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,480
those possible things that could happen

918
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,240
and quantum theory in fact tells you how

919
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,160
to assign those weights to things that

920
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,380
could happen in order to make a

921
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,859
measurement given some theory of the

922
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:47,160
mechanism that makes things happen

923
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,200
but the fact that all of the paths have

924
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,599
to be counted as what unitary Evolution

925
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,599
means this in this this Evolution that

926
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:57,000
preserves information that doesn't take

927
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,819
any away it doesn't add any it just

928
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:03,060
represents it in different ways so if

929
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,040
you look at the screen

930
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,740
and imagine that Alice is interacting

931
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,300
with her boundary

932
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,160
and then she's interacting with her

933
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,440
boundary again it looks just like the

934
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,940
previous screen

935
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,640
and the way they read arrows are what's

936
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,579
happening inside Bob

937
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:23,040
the wavy red arrows are a representation

938
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,880
of what's going on inside Bob as he

939
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,960
measures

940
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,540
his side of the screen and then prepares

941
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,400
his side of the screen

942
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,339
so what Feynman is representing here

943
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,720
is just the action of the environment or

944
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,819
the action of the system

945
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:44,940
uh while Alice isn't looking

946
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,579
between Alice's preparation stage and

947
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:50,640
her measurement stage while Bob is is

948
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,819
doing his measurement in preparation

949
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:56,160
so this diagram is actually completely

950
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,859
symmetrical we could have drawn an arrow

951
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:01,260
where the the wavy red things are and

952
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,140
drawn wavy red things where we've talked

953
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,180
about Alice and we'd have the same

954
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,359
picture just from Bob's point of view

955
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,760
we can also think of this of course as

956
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,339
Alice communicating with her first

957
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:18,839
future self by writing a memory record

958
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:21,359
someplace in the world and then coming

959
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,640
back and reading it

960
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,119
and if Alice writes a memory on the

961
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,260
world

962
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,780
and then comes back later on and reads

963
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,240
it she actually has to take into account

964
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,880
some theory of all of the things the

965
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,099
world might have done to her memory

966
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:41,240
while she wasn't looking

967
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,760
um so this picture of feynman's actually

968
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,400
tells us a lot about memory

969
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,619
and when we think about organisms

970
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:52,500
running around in the world uh doing

971
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,880
things

972
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,060
like we do all the time

973
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,460
um we tend to think of memories as

974
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,440
things that are are persistent and

975
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,540
unchanging and all of that but we know

976
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,400
that that's not true

977
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,740
we know that memory is degrade in

978
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,180
various ways

979
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:13,440
uh we know that uh adversarial third

980
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,780
parties can come and and change what

981
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,599
we've done so that they fool us into

982
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,160
thinking that we've remembered something

983
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,720
that we haven't

984
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,700
and so on and so forth

985
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,880
that whole picture of memory

986
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,900
is actually encoded in in this picture

987
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,000
that Feynman Drew

988
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,760
in the late 50s to represent scattering

989
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,359
of particles

990
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,640
so what we've done here is started with

991
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,000
this simple idea of asking questions

992
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,060
and we've actually constructed a fair

993
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,980
amount of quantum theory we constructed

994
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,020
the Schrodinger equation we constructed

995
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,660
the unitary propagator we constructed

996
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,819
the idea of a reference frame

997
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:03,060
which we'll talk about intensely next

998
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,819
time in July

999
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:08,339
so we can sum this up by saying that

1000
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:11,099
quantum theory simply is a theory of

1001
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,319
communicating agents

1002
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:16,020
and that quantum mechanics

1003
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,839
of the theory that Feynman was

1004
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,460
complaining about

1005
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,460
in that earlier slide

1006
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,099
the quantum mechanics generates this

1007
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:29,640
problem that seems intractable of how to

1008
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,380
understand measurement

1009
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,720
because the theory is in fact about

1010
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,420
measurement it's not about mechanical

1011
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,460
motion at all

1012
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,099
so Quantum Theory actually tells us

1013
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:43,819
nothing about ontology

1014
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,500
and this is why the interpretations of

1015
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,780
quantum theory the the many worlds

1016
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,579
interpretation where you have all these

1017
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:52,619
branching universes

1018
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,859
uh and so forth are not really science

1019
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,440
they're philosophy their attempts to

1020
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,960
understand an ontology

1021
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,460
of

1022
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,500
that's generated by a theory that

1023
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,599
doesn't talk about ontology it talks

1024
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:09,900
about communication between agents

1025
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,760
but we've left something very important

1026
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,180
out we've left out a consideration of

1027
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,880
what happens when Alice and Bob don't

1028
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,819
mean the same thing by up and down

1029
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:23,280
and we've left out the famous phenomenon

1030
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,540
of entanglement

1031
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,460
uh

1032
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,520
spooky action at a distance as Einstein

1033
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,680
called it and it turns out these things

1034
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,420
that we've left out are very very

1035
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,060
closely related

1036
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,520
and we're going to see why

1037
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,040
in July and I'm going to give you a

1038
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,900
brief preview now

1039
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,119
so what happens when Alice and Bob

1040
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,700
actually mean different things by up and

1041
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,160
down what if their reference frames

1042
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,920
aren't aligned

1043
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,780
well the first thing to note is that

1044
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,760
nothing in the theory says they have to

1045
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,200
be aligned

1046
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,359
so we have to consider the possibility

1047
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:02,119
that they're not

1048
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:05,819
and in fact both Alice and Bob have to

1049
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:07,920
have what's called free choice of

1050
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,280
reference frame when Alice prepares her

1051
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,859
her instrument she has to be able to

1052
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:16,140
prepare it any way she wants to in order

1053
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,960
to do an experiment

1054
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,339
and uh when Bob makes up a sentence to

1055
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:26,400
tell Alice uh he has to be able to

1056
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,040
choose any language he wants to use

1057
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,099
he's a he's a free agent in this way

1058
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:34,260
and if they don't have that freedom it

1059
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,720
turns out they're entangled so reference

1060
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,960
frame non-alignment and entanglement are

1061
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,579
very very closely coupled

1062
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,640
now misalignment of reference frames is

1063
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:52,079
what produces superpositions of outcomes

1064
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,859
so if Alice makes her measurements with

1065
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,380
her up and down arrow arranged

1066
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,720
vertically for example

1067
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,920
but Bob prepares his qubit with his up

1068
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,140
and down

1069
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,859
Arrow

1070
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:12,060
arranged at 90 degrees to Alice's Alice

1071
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,040
is not going to have any idea what Bob

1072
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,940
did

1073
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,760
I mean she can't see distinctions in the

1074
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,920
left right direction she can only see

1075
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,540
distinctions in the up and down

1076
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,920
Direction

1077
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,040
so all she can do is flip a coin

1078
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,280
if she wants to know what uh Bob

1079
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,160
prepared it's 50 percent likely he

1080
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,359
prepared up for her what she calls one

1081
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:39,180
and it's fifty percent likely that he

1082
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,700
prepared what's down for her she can't

1083
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,380
tell

1084
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,260
oh now if Bob

1085
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,300
if Bob's reference frame is pointing at

1086
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,140
about 45 degrees so up for him means 45

1087
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:55,079
degrees off of Alice's up

1088
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:58,260
then she can sort of tell what he did

1089
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,520
if if he's pointing 45 degrees from Up

1090
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,339
then uh she's probably going to measure

1091
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:06,480
up

1092
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,240
and if he's putting 45 degrees from town

1093
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,640
she's probably going to measure down

1094
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,359
so her outcomes are 75 percent for one

1095
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,059
and 25 percent for minus one if he

1096
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:22,380
prepares uh at this 45 degree angle

1097
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,540
so we can write this in a particular way

1098
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,700
we can say that

1099
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,280
the value that Alice gets acting with

1100
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,599
her M on a qubit that Bob prepared

1101
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,420
is some number times what she measures

1102
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,940
is up plus some other number plus times

1103
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,180
what she measures as minus one

1104
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,940
where those numbers the squares of those

1105
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,559
numbers add to one

1106
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,839
so why do they have to add to one well

1107
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,040
they add to one because of the

1108
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,319
Pythagorean theorem

1109
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,319
oh

1110
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:58,500
one is the distance the total distance

1111
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,319
between the two outcomes

1112
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:02,700
and

1113
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,240
um

1114
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,760
a squared plus b squared are the other

1115
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,380
two sides of that triangle so

1116
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:11,520
um

1117
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,859
another way to think of it is that

1118
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:16,500
the metric distance

1119
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,000
of

1120
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,740
[Music]

1121
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,599
impossibility space is one

1122
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,720
and a squared and B squared are just the

1123
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,579
euclidean distance components again

1124
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,500
euclidean distance is based on the

1125
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,180
Pythagorean theorem

1126
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,460
so this is the born rule in quantum

1127
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,480
theory

1128
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,119
uh it's the rule that tells us what

1129
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,920
happens when we're trying to measure a

1130
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,480
superposition

1131
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,920
and it tells us where these

1132
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,220
superpositions come from uh

1133
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,619
we have a mismatch in in reference

1134
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:49,319
frames between two agents that are

1135
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:51,859
communicating

1136
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,819
so

1137
00:52:53,819 --> 00:52:55,920
if we go back to the free energy

1138
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,819
principle which is what uh this whole

1139
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:02,760
active inference class is about

1140
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,460
and we formulated in quantum theory we

1141
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,800
get a very simple idea of what the free

1142
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,960
energy principle is

1143
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,720
the fep and quantum theory just says

1144
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,760
that interacting systems are going to

1145
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,500
behave in a way that aligns their

1146
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,119
reference frames

1147
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:20,460
and that makes their communication as

1148
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,760
good as it can be

1149
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,460
uh but since aligning reference frames

1150
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,140
perfectly

1151
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,599
leads to entanglement

1152
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:33,900
of the free energy principle drives

1153
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,059
systems asymptotically toward

1154
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:38,720
entanglement

1155
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:42,119
well the principle of unitarity

1156
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,220
says that all systems will approach

1157
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,040
entanglement asymptotically

1158
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,800
so we can see the fep is actually a

1159
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,540
classical statement of the principle of

1160
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,579
unitarity

1161
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:55,559
and what we'll see in the next session

1162
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:58,980
is why this is the case why active

1163
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,859
inference when we think of a Quantum

1164
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:04,619
mechanically is a way of talking about

1165
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,319
the principle of unitarity which is the

1166
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:10,859
deepest Axiom of quantum theory

1167
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:13,800
and we'll also see that this question of

1168
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,280
alignment becomes more and more complex

1169
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,119
as the complexity of the messages of the

1170
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,220
CIS that the systems are trying to

1171
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,220
communicate to each other increases

1172
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:29,160
and the message complexity correlates

1173
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,500
with system complexity

1174
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,680
so that aligning complicated systems is

1175
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,960
very hard

1176
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,940
although aligning very simple systems is

1177
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:42,240
fairly easy if you think about

1178
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,819
uh what's the what's the simplest

1179
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:46,200
possible

1180
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,599
theory in science it's particle physics

1181
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,339
because you're dealing with these very

1182
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:52,380
simple things that interact in extremely

1183
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,119
simple ways

1184
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:56,579
and the really difficult parts of

1185
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:58,920
science are things like sociology

1186
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,920
where you're dealing with uh incredibly

1187
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,140
complicated systems like humans that

1188
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,599
interact in incredibly complicated ways

1189
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:09,900
and all we have are very vague kind of

1190
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,839
folk theories of how that works

1191
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:16,440
but we know from that example that

1192
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,780
aligning complex systems is extremely

1193
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,000
difficult

1194
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,540
um

1195
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,520
it's what humans don't get along very

1196
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,680
well

1197
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,800
so the second session uh well the second

1198
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,660
discussion section which Andrew will be

1199
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,180
leading is on Saturday the first of July

1200
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,040
a couple of weeks from now

1201
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,800
the third lecture session will be on

1202
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,559
July 13th

1203
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:43,500
and uh I hope you all will contribute to

1204
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,660
the interactive question and answer

1205
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,359
session on the web

1206
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:51,119
and uh show up for the discussion on

1207
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,839
Saturday the 1st of July and join us

1208
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:58,619
again in July for the discussion of

1209
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:00,660
quantum reference frames and reference

1210
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,920
Frame Alignment

1211
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,119
so thank you very much

1212
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:12,240
thank you Chris

1213
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,460
all right thank you all again please

1214
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,280
check out the chorus syllabus

1215
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,880
ask questions through the site and

1216
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,619
see you at the discussion see you next

1217
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:23,640
time

1218
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,779
thank you bye
