00:00:07,793 --> 00:00:08,862
Daniel Friedman: Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:12,313
It's June 15, 2023.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,670
We are here in lecture two of Chris field'

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:15,670
's course, physics as Information

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,026
Processing.

6
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:19,068
So.

7
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:21,201
Thank you, Chris.

8
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:23,443
Looking forward to the lecture.

9
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:26,763
Chris Fields: Thank you, Daniel.

10
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:29,035
And, yes, welcome to this session.

11
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:30,146
How?

12
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:33,449
This section is titled why Quantum

13
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:34,526
Physics.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,968
And if you will recall, from the first

15
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:38,968
session, we reviewed the history of

16
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:38,968
physics and some of the history of

17
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:38,968
mathematics and computer science from the

18
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:38,968
end of the 19th century through to the

19
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:54,550
beginning of the 21st century.

20
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:59,067
And discuss the slow development from

21
00:00:59,067 --> 00:00:59,067
classical thermodynamics of quantum

22
00:00:59,067 --> 00:00:59,067
information theory and specifically

23
00:00:59,067 --> 00:00:59,067
characterizing quantum information theory

24
00:00:59,067 --> 00:00:59,067
as a new kind of physics that describes

25
00:00:59,067 --> 00:00:59,067
systems that are exchanging finite

26
00:00:59,067 --> 00:00:59,067
amounts of discretely encoded information

27
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:30,577
across some intervening boundary.

28
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:35,036
And so we use this very conventional

29
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:35,036
graphical notation of two agents or

30
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:35,036
physical systems, alice and Bob, A and B,

31
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:35,036
that are exchanging energy and

32
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:52,078
information across some boundary.

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,112
And I always use a blue ellipse like this

34
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:56,112
to indicate the boundary that separates

35
00:01:56,112 --> 00:02:00,096
Alice from Bob.

36
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:06,150
And this new approach to physics is

37
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,178
entirely topological.

38
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,198
It's not geometric.

39
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:13,228
So it doesn't assume a particular

40
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:13,228
background spacetime, so it doesn't

41
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:13,228
assume that Alice and Bob are spatially

42
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:20,296
separated.

43
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:25,345
And so this makes it a very different

44
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:25,345
kind of theory from classical information

45
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:25,345
theory in that the channel that separates

46
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:25,345
Alice from Bob, this boundary is a

47
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:39,488
boundary in state space.

48
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,521
It's not a boundary in some geometric

49
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:44,535
embedding space.

50
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:47,565
And in particular, it's not a boundary or

51
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:47,565
a channel that's embedded in a three

52
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:47,565
dimensional space that separates Alice

53
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:53,628
from Bob.

54
00:02:55,644 --> 00:02:59,686
So that's what we talked about last time

55
00:02:59,686 --> 00:02:59,686
and today what I want to discuss is how

56
00:02:59,686 --> 00:02:59,686
quantum theory in particular makes this

57
00:02:59,686 --> 00:02:59,686
idea of physics as a theory of

58
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:14,777
communication simple and obvious.

59
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:19,825
And quantum theory, of course, has a

60
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:19,825
terrible reputation of being abstruse and

61
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:19,825
mathematically incredibly complicated and

62
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:19,825
counterintuitive and difficult to

63
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:31,945
understand.

64
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:36,997
And this is one quotation among many from

65
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:36,997
leading physicists pointing out that

66
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:44,074
quantum mechanics is just difficult.

67
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:49,122
And as you probably know, there's an

68
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:49,122
entire philosophical industry of

69
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:49,122
interpretations of quantum theory that

70
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:59,225
try to make sense of its ontology.

71
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:06,232
What I don't want to do today is try to

72
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:08,257
introduce quantum mechanics.

73
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:13,307
We're not doing any of this.

74
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:17,343
Some of you will recognize this as the

75
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:17,343
table of contents, the first part of the

76
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:17,343
table of contents of the famous textbook

77
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:24,416
by Landau and Lifts.

78
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,429
How that?

79
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,455
If you've studied quantum theory in

80
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:28,455
undergraduate or graduate school, you've

81
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:28,455
probably dealt with a textbook structured

82
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:35,528
much like this one.

83
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:39,564
And you've probably been introduced to

84
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:39,564
quantum mechanics as it was traditionally

85
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:39,564
conceived as essentially a mechanical

86
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:39,564
theory, a theory of motion with wave

87
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:39,564
functions and particle representations

88
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:54,714
and on and on and on.

89
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:57,742
So we're not going to try to do that.

90
00:04:57,743 --> 00:05:00,718
This what we're going to do instead is

91
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:00,718
take a completely information theoretic

92
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:00,718
approach, and we're going to characterize

93
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:00,718
information transfer in a quantum

94
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:00,718
theoretic way without any assumptions

95
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:00,718
about mechanics or spacetime or any of

96
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:18,897
that.

97
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,934
So instead of this, we're going to ask a

98
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:23,947
simple question.

99
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:28,994
By a simple question, I mean a question

100
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:28,994
with just a yes no answer or a binary

101
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:31,027
answer.

102
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:35,066
So let's use up or down as our example

103
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,076
question.

104
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:40,115
And to ask this question, we need three

105
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:41,120
things.

106
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:43,148
First, we need an action.

107
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:46,172
We need a way of asking it.

108
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:50,215
For example, making a sound or writing

109
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:51,226
something down.

110
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:57,284
Second, we need a thing that we can ask

111
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:59,299
the question of.

112
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,285
We need an environment or a friend or the

113
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:03,285
rest of the world or an experimental

114
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:03,285
apparatus or some system or other that we'

115
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:03,285
're going to act on to ask this question.

116
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:13,389
.

117
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,432
And the third thing that we need to ask

118
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:21,460
this question is a shared language.

119
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,504
And it's the shared language that's often

120
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:29,540
neglected in models based in physics.

121
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,581
And I think the importance of the shared

122
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:33,581
language became clear in classical

123
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:36,612
information theory.

124
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:38,637
And it's become clear again, of course,

125
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:40,655
in quantum information theory.

126
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:43,682
But this has only happened over the last

127
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:44,690
few decades.

128
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:47,726
So what I want to do today is to

129
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:47,726
construct in a step by step fashion a

130
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:47,726
formal representation of these three

131
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:47,726
things that we need to ask a simple

132
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:58,836
question.

133
00:06:58,838 --> 00:07:01,806
And what we'll find is that that formal

134
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:01,806
representation is in fact quantum theory.

135
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:04,836
.

136
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:08,875
So it's quantum theory that provides us

137
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:08,875
with a formal representation of asking

138
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:15,944
these simple binary questions.

139
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:18,970
And of course, if you can ask a binary

140
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:18,970
question, you can ask any finite number

141
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,009
of binary questions.

142
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:25,047
So you can construct an Arbitrarily

143
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:25,047
complex finite decision tree that ends up

144
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:25,047
formulating an Arbitrarily complex but

145
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:35,146
still finite question.

146
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,181
So this really is a general model of

147
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:39,181
communicative interactions between agents.

148
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:42,218
.

149
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:48,273
So let's go about this and talk first

150
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:48,273
about the action of asking you a question.

151
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:52,310
.

152
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:56,352
And so the first thing I want you to do

153
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:56,352
is actually say out loud up or down,

154
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:56,352
actually ask a question and then note two

155
00:07:56,352 --> 00:08:08,410
things about what just happened.

156
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:12,452
The first thing to note is that it took

157
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,468
some time to do that.

158
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,504
That action actually required a finite

159
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:17,504
amount of time, a couple of seconds, not

160
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:23,569
very long, but it's not zero.

161
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:27,605
It always takes time to ask a question.

162
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:31,645
And the second thing to note is that it

163
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:34,678
took energy to actually say up or down.

164
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:39,720
It requires a little bit of exertion to

165
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,736
ask a question.

166
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:45,782
So let's put those two together and

167
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:46,798
define a word.

168
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,830
We're going to define the word action to

169
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:50,830
mean some energy that's spent in some

170
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,865
time.

171
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,900
So asking a question is an action and it

172
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:57,900
qualifies as an action because it

173
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:57,900
requires spending some energy in some

174
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:04,919
finite amount of time.

175
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,948
And so we can write this as action equals

176
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,961
energy times time.

177
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:12,999
Or I'll sometimes use the abbreviation E

178
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:13,007
times T.

179
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:22,098
And action is always required when there'

180
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:22,098
's some interaction or two way action

181
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:31,187
between systems.

182
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:34,213
So whenever we talk about physical

183
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:34,213
interaction, we're always talking about

184
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:34,213
two systems doing something to each other

185
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:43,302
that requires both energy and time.

186
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:48,351
So let's define another concept.

187
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:51,380
A concept of a minimum action needed to

188
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:51,380
ask a question, and specifically a

189
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,426
question with a binary answer.

190
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:00,411
And we'll just pick a symbol to stand for

191
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:01,426
that minimum action.

192
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:04,453
And the symbol we'll use because it's

193
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:05,465
conventional is h.

194
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:09,503
And it turns out that this h is planck's

195
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:09,503
constant, the number that planck came up

196
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:09,503
with when he was trying to solve the

197
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:09,503
black body problem back in 1900 that we

198
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:09,503
talked about last time and recall, that

199
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:09,503
was the problem of characterizing, the

200
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:09,503
spectrum of radiation emitted by some

201
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:29,702
physical system.

202
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:30,714
That was hot.

203
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:33,739
How much energy comes out as a function

204
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:33,748
of temperature.

205
00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:37,783
And if you assume that the spectrum of

206
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:37,783
energy coming out is continuous, you get

207
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:42,832
predictions that are wrong.

208
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:45,865
And Planck got predictions that were

209
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:45,865
correct by assuming that that spectrum

210
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:45,865
was discrete and that this h represented

211
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:45,865
the minimum amount of energy that could

212
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:58,997
be emitted in a particular time.

213
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:01,967
So it represented the minimum energy

214
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,983
times time or action.

215
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:06,014
So let's look at an example of that.

216
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:09,043
And here's an example that may be

217
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:09,049
familiar.

218
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,076
It's the example of your own visual

219
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:13,082
system.

220
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:18,129
So in the retinal, the cells of your

221
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:18,129
retinas, there are many, many molecules

222
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:18,129
that are rodoxins of one variety or other

223
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:18,129
that respond to different wavelengths of

224
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:18,129
visible light, and they have some

225
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:35,307
efficiency for capturing light.

226
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:38,334
And let's just assume that they're

227
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:38,334
optimally efficient, that they're as

228
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:43,383
efficient as they could possibly be.

229
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:47,420
And that means that they require the

230
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:47,420
minimum amount of energy to change shape,

231
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:47,420
which is what they do when they're

232
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:47,420
impacted by Light to capture the energy

233
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:47,420
and hence the information that's

234
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:47,420
available in the Light and the minimum

235
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:47,420
energy to do anything that records one

236
00:11:47,420 --> 00:12:07,563
bit of information.

237
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:08,577
So yes or no?

238
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:12,611
Up or down is 0.7.

239
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:17,664
So log two of Boltzman's constant times

240
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:19,687
the temperature.

241
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,733
And again, we saw this last time.

242
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,783
This is from roughly 1875 and was then

243
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:29,783
built into classical information theory

244
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:29,783
by Shannon and then by Landauer in the

245
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:40,893
mid 20th century.

246
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:43,920
So what we're doing is assuming that

247
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:43,920
since rudopsin is optimally efficient,

248
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:43,920
all it requires is this amount of energy

249
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,986
to change shape.

250
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:52,014
And it's known experimentally, that

251
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:52,014
rhodopsin takes about 200 femtoseconds to

252
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:55,048
change shape.

253
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:59,083
So that's 200 times ten to the -15.

254
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:00,033
Seconds.

255
00:13:00,035 --> 00:13:02,059
So it's a very very fast reaction,

256
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:04,073
chemical reaction.

257
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:09,121
So we can just calculate what the action

258
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,121
is and at 37 degrees centigrade so human

259
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,121
body temperature KT is about 4.3 times

260
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,121
ten to the -21 Joule and Joule is just a

261
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,121
standard unit of energy and so we can

262
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:27,308
multiply everything together.

263
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:31,349
KT times zero seven times.

264
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,389
This response time of 200 femtoseconds

265
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:35,389
multiplied together gives you an action

266
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:35,389
of about six times ten to the -34 joule

267
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:45,482
seconds.

268
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:48,510
And if you're familiar with quantum

269
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:48,510
mechanics, you'll instantly recognize

270
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:48,510
that number because it's very close to

271
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:48,510
the value of Planck's Constant, which is

272
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:56,595
6.6 times.

273
00:13:56,595 --> 00:13:57,607
Ten to the -34.

274
00:13:57,607 --> 00:13:58,617
Joule seconds.

275
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:01,588
So this says that Rhodopsin is very near

276
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:02,597
to optimal.

277
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:09,660
The best it would be able to do would be

278
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,677
Planck's constant.

279
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:13,703
That's the minimum action that can be

280
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:14,711
undertaken.

281
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:19,762
So Rodobson is clearly doing very well.

282
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:23,807
It can't be as efficient as we're

283
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:23,807
assuming it to be, but it's pretty

284
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:28,858
efficient.

285
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:32,890
So this number Planck's constant is and

286
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:32,890
this idea of a minimum action is not

287
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,948
something we just pulled out of the air.

288
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:40,971
It's something that one can observe.

289
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:42,998
When you're looking at what real

290
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:42,998
biological systems in particular do and

291
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:48,052
other physical systems do.

292
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:53,107
So let's think about the second component

293
00:14:53,107 --> 00:14:57,143
of this project of asking a question.

294
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,167
And that's the thing to be asked.

295
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:03,143
And we want to ask a very simple question.

296
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:03,143
.

297
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:05,167
We want to have a theory of asking very

298
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,178
simple questions.

299
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:11,226
So let's define the simplest thing that

300
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:15,262
we can ask a binary question to.

301
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:18,296
And let's say this is the thing that we

302
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:18,296
can ask a binary question of using just

303
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:23,344
this minimum action h.

304
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:26,371
So we're going to ask for the minimal

305
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:26,371
thing that it's possible physically to

306
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:30,410
ask a question of.

307
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:33,439
And this thing needs a name, so let's

308
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:34,451
call it a qubit.

309
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:37,487
And that word is a contraction of Quantum

310
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:38,491
bit.

311
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:40,517
And we can draw it like this.

312
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:43,540
A little sphere with an arrow through it.

313
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:43,540
.

314
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,563
That's called a block sphere.

315
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:47,584
And we use a symbol.

316
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:48,591
Q.

317
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:52,638
And that notation with the bar and the

318
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:57,684
angle bracket is called a bra notation.

319
00:15:57,686 --> 00:16:00,652
And it originates with Durac.

320
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:04,693
So it's a traditional way of writing

321
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:04,693
inner products, actually, in quantum

322
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:12,773
theory to indicate the state of Q.

323
00:16:13,783 --> 00:16:17,821
So this thing called a qubit only

324
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:20,855
responds to binary questions.

325
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:23,887
So it clearly can have only two states.

326
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:26,913
The state that answers yes and the state

327
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:27,923
that answers no.

328
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:29,944
And conventionally.

329
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,977
We draw the arrow going up if the answer

330
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:33,983
is yes.

331
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:36,010
And the arrow going down if the answer is

332
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,012
no.

333
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:39,045
And so those are the two states that the

334
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:39,045
qubit can be in when it's answered a

335
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:43,083
question.

336
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:47,129
So now let's draw a picture for the act

337
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:51,164
of asking a question of q in the state.

338
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:51,167
Q.

339
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:53,184
And let's draw it like this.

340
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:58,232
This curvy arrow is the action of asking

341
00:16:58,232 --> 00:16:58,232
the question and getting the answer back.

342
00:16:58,232 --> 00:17:01,205
.

343
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:04,233
And we're asking it of this minimum

344
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,247
system, the qubit.

345
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:11,308
And let's call this entire act of h and

346
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:11,308
write h acting on Q by this expression HQ.

347
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:18,370
.

348
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:21,408
So again, we're developing the notation

349
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:21,408
of quantum theory, which all of you who

350
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:21,408
know the theory already will find

351
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:28,476
familiar.

352
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:33,526
So the third thing that we have to build

353
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:33,526
into this picture and into the theory is

354
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:38,573
the shared language.

355
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:43,626
So we have to know what we mean by up or

356
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:43,626
down if we're going to ask the question

357
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:48,677
up or down?

358
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:54,730
And we have to have some representation

359
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:54,730
of what it means for the qubit to

360
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:00,731
distinguish up or down.

361
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:04,779
So let's say that to us, up and down mean

362
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:04,779
this little diagram with an arrow that's

363
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:04,779
labeled up on one end and down on the

364
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:14,875
other end.

365
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:17,907
So we're defining up and down in a very

366
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:20,930
simple way as just opposites.

367
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:22,951
We don't know anything else about them

368
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:23,968
except that they're opposites.

369
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,996
So this is a stripped down one bit

370
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:27,000
question.

371
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,002
We could have called them one and minus

372
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:30,003
one.

373
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:32,005
We could have called them A and B.

374
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:33,006
We could have called them anything.

375
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:38,011
We're just indicating that up and down

376
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:40,013
are two opposing concepts.

377
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:44,017
And so this object that we've used to

378
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:44,017
make this definition of the relationship

379
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:44,017
between our two words up and down is

380
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:53,026
called a reference frame.

381
00:18:55,028 --> 00:19:00,027
It's a physical object that encodes a

382
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:03,030
concept or a meaning.

383
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:07,034
And if you think about using language,

384
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
using English, for example, you can

385
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
understand me speaking in English because

386
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
your brain has the right sorts of neural

387
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
circuits to allow you to understand

388
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
English and produce English using your

389
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:25,052
hand in your mouth.

390
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:29,056
And those neural circuits are reference

391
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
frames in your brain for understanding

392
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:34,061
and producing English.

393
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:37,064
And they encode the relationships between

394
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:38,065
different words.

395
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:43,069
So you all know about Chat GPT.

396
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,073
You can think of all of the weights on

397
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:46,073
all of the ten to the 19th or however

398
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:46,073
many parameters there are in GPT four as

399
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:46,073
a reference frame that describes the

400
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:46,073
relationships between words and phrases

401
00:19:46,073 --> 00:20:01,082
in English and many other languages.

402
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,086
So this idea of a reference frame is an

403
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:05,086
instance of Landauer's principle, which

404
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:05,086
is often summarized as saying that

405
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:14,095
information is physical.

406
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:17,098
What that means is that information

407
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:17,098
always has to have some encoding and that

408
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:17,098
encoding, that object can always be

409
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:28,109
thought of as a reference frame.

410
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,112
So let's put all this stuff together.

411
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:36,117
What we have now is a reference frame

412
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
that defines the difference between up

413
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:40,121
and down.

414
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:44,125
We have an action that we've labeled H,

415
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:44,125
and the action acts on this object, the

416
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:51,132
qubit, which is in some state.

417
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:55,136
And what we've drawn here now is an

418
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:56,137
experiment.

419
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:01,136
And you can think of the incoming part of

420
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:01,136
the arrow that goes from the reference

421
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:01,136
frame to the qubit as a preparation of

422
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:08,143
the qubit.

423
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:11,146
So you can think of it as I'm doing

424
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:11,146
something to the qubit to put it in a

425
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:11,146
particular state like up, because that's

426
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:20,155
the state I want it to be in.

427
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:25,160
And I can think of this returning part of

428
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,160
the arrow as a measurement of the state

429
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,165
that the qubit is actually in.

430
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,169
So if the qubit is actually in this state

431
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:34,169
with the arrow pointing up, then I'm

432
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:34,169
going to get back the answer up when I

433
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:42,177
act on the qubit to measure its state.

434
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:49,183
So now we can recognize this action, H as

435
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:49,183
the Hamiltonian operator in quantum

436
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:49,183
theory, which always takes some time,

437
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:49,183
which we represent by an interval DT, to

438
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:49,183
act on some state, and in particular this

439
00:21:49,183 --> 00:22:08,197
binary state, Q.

440
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:12,201
So this whole picture depicts the action

441
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:15,204
of a very simple Hamiltonian operator.

442
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:20,209
And again, I want to emphasize that we've

443
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:20,209
just defined the qubit as the simplest

444
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:20,209
thing that we can ask a binary question

445
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:26,215
of.

446
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:31,220
So how does this H work?

447
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:36,225
We can use H to prepare this qubit in one

448
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,225
of two states, which we're going to label

449
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:41,230
one and minus one.

450
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:45,234
The state one corresponds to the up

451
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:45,234
direction, and the state minus one

452
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:45,234
corresponds to the down direction, and

453
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:55,244
doing this to Q.

454
00:22:55,244 --> 00:22:59,248
So preparing Q in one of these two states

455
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:02,245
takes energy, and we know how much.

456
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:06,249
Boltzman told us back in 1875 that the

457
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:06,249
minimum energy to reduce the entropy of

458
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:06,249
the universe by one bit is log two of KT.

459
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:14,257
.

460
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:17,260
We saw that earlier when we were thinking

461
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,261
about Rhodobson.

462
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:22,265
So we can say that acting with H always

463
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:22,265
requires some number times KT, where that

464
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:29,272
number is bigger than the log of two.

465
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:34,277
Remember, the log of two is just in there

466
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
to get units of bits of binary questions,

467
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
as opposed to units of nats, which are

468
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
questions that have e answers, where E is

469
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
the exponential base, the natural

470
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:51,294
exponential base.

471
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:54,297
But we want to use units of bits, so we

472
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:54,297
have to always have this factor of log

473
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:57,299
two.

474
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:02,299
So this lets us write H in a particular

475
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:02,299
way.

476
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:07,304
We can take out this energetic term that

477
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:07,304
Boltzman tells us we have to include beta

478
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:12,309
times KT.

479
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:17,314
And what's left over is, in a sense, the

480
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:17,314
pure representation of the action,

481
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:22,319
stripping out the energy requirement.

482
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,323
And we're going to call that M, because M

483
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:26,323
is the standard symbol to use in quantum

484
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:32,329
theory for a measurement operator.

485
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,333
And M is now dimensionless.

486
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:43,340
H has units of energy, KT is an energy,

487
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,344
and M has no units at all.

488
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:50,347
So it's H without the energy.

489
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:54,351
So now we can ask, what is this operator

490
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:54,351
M that we've defined as the simplest

491
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:54,351
possible action on a qubit, but

492
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:54,351
abstracting away the amount of energy

493
00:24:54,351 --> 00:25:05,356
that we have to use to act on the qubit.

494
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:10,361
Well, what M does is just encode a bit or

495
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:12,363
decode a bit.

496
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:17,368
So we can use this operator M to say, I

497
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:20,371
want Q to have the value one.

498
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:23,374
I want it to be up, so I can sort of

499
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:23,374
reach out with my operator M and grab Q

500
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:23,374
and turn it so that its arrow is pointing

501
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:30,381
up.

502
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:34,385
And that's the operation.

503
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:36,387
That's called preparation in physics.

504
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:38,389
It's what it means to prepare an

505
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:39,390
experimental apparatus.

506
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,392
For example, you actually grab hold of

507
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:42,392
the apparatus, and you twist some knobs

508
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:42,392
and flick some switches to prepare it to

509
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:48,399
be in some state.

510
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,403
And you can use M to measure a state that

511
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:54,405
isn't known.

512
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:58,409
So I can use M to grab a hold of Q and

513
00:25:58,409 --> 00:25:58,409
look at it and determine whether it's in

514
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:05,410
state one or minus one.

515
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,413
And I can represent these as just a cycle

516
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:08,413
that starts with measuring and then

517
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:08,413
prepares, or that starts with preparing

518
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:14,419
and then measuring.

519
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,424
And if I represent it that way, what I

520
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:19,424
see is M having a value which is either

521
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:19,424
the value I want to encode or the value

522
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:29,434
that I have measured.

523
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:33,438
And Q and M acts on that value and Q to

524
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:33,438
produce a particular state of Q, to put Q

525
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:33,438
in a particular state, or to realize that

526
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:43,448
Q is in that state.

527
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:50,455
And so M is actually an identity acting

528
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:53,457
on some value and Q.

529
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,461
So it maps one in Q to one in Q, and it

530
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:56,461
maps minus one in Q to minus one in Q if

531
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:56,461
you do the whole cycle of preparation and

532
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:04,463
then measurement.

533
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:05,464
And that makes sense.

534
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:08,467
It's actually an axiom in some

535
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
formulations of quantum theory that if I

536
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
measure the state of some object, what I'

537
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
'm doing is also preparing it in that

538
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:19,478
state.

539
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:21,480
So if I immediately measure it again, I'

540
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,481
'll see the same value.

541
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:26,485
And that makes sense physically.

542
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:29,488
If I put my coffee cup on the table and

543
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:29,488
then I look for it, it's likely going to

544
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:29,488
be on the table unless something else

545
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:35,494
intervenes.

546
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:37,496
Well, what does this mean?

547
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:39,498
It means that we can do a little bit of

548
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:40,499
algebra.

549
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:46,505
It means that we can write this original

550
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:46,505
expression of acting on Q with our

551
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:46,505
Hamiltonian in this somewhat more

552
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:46,505
explicit form of using the energy beta KT

553
00:27:46,505 --> 00:28:00,513
and our operator M on Q.

554
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:05,518
And what I get out of that is the energy

555
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,520
beta KT multiplied by Q.

556
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,526
So HQ equals EQ.

557
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,529
That's the Schrodinger equation.

558
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,532
So that's one of the central equations of

559
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,532
quantum theory.

560
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,536
What it says is that this operator, H, is

561
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:27,540
the total energy operator on a system.

562
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,544
Its eigenvalues are the total energies of

563
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:32,545
the system.

564
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:35,548
And we can now see where that energy is

565
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
coming from in this very, very simple,

566
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
stripped down kind of representation of

567
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:43,556
an action.

568
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:47,560
The energy is the thermodynamic energy

569
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
that has to be spent to determine one

570
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,565
binary outcome up or down.

571
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:58,571
Now, if you're familiar with quantum

572
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:58,571
mechanics, you will have seen

573
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:58,571
exponentiated operators like the next

574
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:06,573
line here of algebra.

575
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:12,579
This operator P, which is time dependent

576
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:12,579
and which is the exponential of H

577
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:12,579
multiplied by it over H bar, is called

578
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:22,589
the propagator.

579
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:25,591
It's the unitary operator in quantum

580
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:25,591
theory, the operator that conserves

581
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:30,597
probability or conserves information.

582
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:36,603
And so, using the representation of H as

583
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:36,603
beta KT, we can see that this operator P

584
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:45,612
is just E to the minus beta M.

585
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:50,617
If we recall the WIC rotation from the

586
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:50,617
first session, this strange equivalence

587
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:50,617
of it over H bar with one over KT that

588
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:50,617
wasn't discovered until 50 years after

589
00:29:50,617 --> 00:30:03,624
the invention of quantum theory.

590
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:09,630
And it's still a very debated thing.

591
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:12,633
I mean, people worry about what this

592
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:13,634
equation really means.

593
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:17,638
But one thing that it means in this

594
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:17,638
setting where H has this particularly

595
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:17,638
simple form is that the propagator is now

596
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:17,638
just the exponential of a number

597
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:17,638
multiplied by this very simple strip down

598
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:17,638
operator that encodes a bit or decodes a

599
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:36,657
bit.

600
00:30:38,658 --> 00:30:39,660
But we know something about the

601
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:39,660
exponential propagator just by looking at

602
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,663
its form.

603
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:45,665
If you're again familiar with these sorts

604
00:30:45,665 --> 00:30:45,665
of exponential operators, you know that

605
00:30:45,665 --> 00:30:48,669
they're wave equations.

606
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:53,674
And we can make sense of that using the

607
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:54,675
diagram up above.

608
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:58,679
What M is doing is just performing a

609
00:30:58,679 --> 00:30:59,680
cycle.

610
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,678
It's just mapping one and Q back to

611
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:03,678
itself, or minus one and Q back to itself.

612
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:07,682
.

613
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:14,689
So we can think of M as just taking this

614
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:14,689
object and flipping it back around until

615
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:24,699
it gets itself again.

616
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,704
And that kind of cycle can always be

617
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:29,704
turned into a wave equation and e to the

618
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:34,709
I over H bar times.

619
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:38,713
HT is a canonical form of a wave equation,

620
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:38,713
, where the horizontal axis here on the

621
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:43,718
wave is time.

622
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,721
Or if you look at the little cycle that I'

623
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:46,721
've drawn as a circle with an arrow, it's

624
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:46,721
the time of the thing spinning around

625
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:46,721
like this, which is exactly the same

626
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:57,732
thing as a wave traveling through time.

627
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:01,730
So that tells us something very important.

628
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:01,730
.

629
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:04,733
It tells us that this equivalent

630
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:04,733
expression, e to the minus beta M, is

631
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:09,738
also a wave equation.

632
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:13,742
So it tells us that this operator M has

633
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:17,746
built into it some sense of time.

634
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:22,751
It's the sense of time of this prepare

635
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:23,752
measure cycle.

636
00:32:24,753 --> 00:32:28,757
And that's implicit in m right.

637
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:31,760
We've used the WIC rotation to get rid of

638
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:31,760
what I'll end up calling the external

639
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:38,767
time t, the objective time T.

640
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:45,773
And we'll see in July where this internal

641
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:45,773
time comes from in terms of the WIC

642
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:51,780
rotation.

643
00:32:52,781 --> 00:32:56,785
But we can say now that it's an agent

644
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:57,786
specific time.

645
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:01,784
It's an internal time reference frame

646
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
that's built into our idea of this system,

647
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
, Alice, that can act on the world, and

648
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
it represents the time that's required to

649
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:12,795
ask this question.

650
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:17,800
Ander Aguirre: Okay, can I ask a question at this

651
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:17,800
point?

652
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,801
Chris: Yes.

653
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:22,805
Ander: So on this slide with the operator

654
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:24,807
M, I'm curious.

655
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:26,809
How can the agent deploy in the operator

656
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:26,809
M tell the difference or break the

657
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:26,809
symmetry between preparation and

658
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:31,814
measurement?

659
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:34,817
Or are they just completely dual

660
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:35,817
pictures?

661
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:37,820
Chris: Yeah, they're completely dual.

662
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,824
So the agent never breaks the symmetry.

663
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:44,827
The agent can't actually distinguish the

664
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
act of preparing from the act of

665
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:47,830
measuring.

666
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:50,833
Every preparation is a measurement, and

667
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:52,835
every measurement is a preparation.

668
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:53,836
Ander: Right.

669
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:58,841
Chris: That's, in fact, what this axiom

670
00:33:58,841 --> 00:33:58,841
of unitarity measuring a state leaves the

671
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:06,843
particle in the measured state means.

672
00:34:06,843 --> 00:34:07,844
Ander: Right.

673
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:11,848
Chris: So, yeah, mathematically, they're

674
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:12,849
duals.

675
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,851
Ander: Thank you.

676
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:19,856
Chris: Okay, so let's now use this theory

677
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:19,856
that we've developed to describe the

678
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:24,861
interaction between Alice and Bob.

679
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:28,865
And let's think of a situation in which

680
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:28,865
Alice prepares a qubit that Bob then

681
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:28,865
measures, and then Bob prepares the very

682
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:39,876
same qubit, and then Alice measures it.

683
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:42,879
So Alice acts with her Hamiltonian

684
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:42,879
operator, which we'll label Ha, and Bob

685
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:42,879
acts with his Hamiltonian operator that

686
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:50,887
we label HB.

687
00:34:52,888 --> 00:34:55,892
And let's say that Alice prepares the

688
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:57,893
qubit as in state up.

689
00:34:57,894 --> 00:35:01,892
And Bob can then measure the qubit in

690
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:01,892
state up and say, oh, the qubit is now up.

691
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,895
.

692
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,899
And if Bob then prepares the qubit in

693
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
state down, alice can measure the qubit

694
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
in state down and say, oh, the qubit

695
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
switched from the up that I prepared to

696
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:17,908
down.

697
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,910
So Bob must have prepared it as down.

698
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,913
So what's happened here?

699
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:28,919
Alice and Bob have actually shared a bit

700
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:28,919
flip.

701
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:34,925
Alice said up and Bob said, down, and

702
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,928
Alice heard him say down.

703
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,932
So they've shared this idea of change by

704
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,934
interacting with each other.

705
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:47,938
Now, this works as long as they mean the

706
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,940
same thing by up and down.

707
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,943
So we've implicitly assumed, in talking

708
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:53,943
about them communicating, that they both

709
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:53,943
have this reference frame that

710
00:35:53,943 --> 00:36:00,945
distinguishes up from down.

711
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:05,950
And this is actually a completely general

712
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:05,950
model of what I'll call a noiseless one

713
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:10,955
qubit channel.

714
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:12,957
Now, what does that mean?

715
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:15,960
It's noiseless because there's nothing

716
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,962
else in the picture, right?

717
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:20,965
There's nothing in the picture that can

718
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:20,965
jiggle the qubit when Alice and Bob aren'

719
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:23,968
't looking.

720
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:25,970
Alice and Bob are the only systems we're

721
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:25,970
talking about, and they share this qubit

722
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:30,975
and there's nothing else in the picture.

723
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:33,978
So there's no kind of third party or

724
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:33,978
environment or heat bath or anything like

725
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:33,978
that that's going to mess with the qubit

726
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:42,987
and disrupt their interaction.

727
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:45,990
So that's a noiseless channel and it's a

728
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:45,990
one qubit channel because they just have

729
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:45,990
one qubit that they're interacting with

730
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:45,990
and they're alternately preparing and

731
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:55,000
measuring its state.

732
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:59,004
Now, clearly, if they can interact using

733
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
one qubit, they can interact using any

734
00:36:59,004 --> 00:37:03,002
finite number of qubits.

735
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:06,005
So here's a picture of an in qubit

736
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:06,005
channel that Alice and Bob, which here I'

737
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:06,005
've labeled A and B because I took this

738
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:16,015
figure from a paper, are sharing.

739
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:20,019
And Alice and Bob both have N operators,

740
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:20,019
one for each of the N qubits that they

741
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:25,024
share.

742
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:27,026
And they just do this prepared

743
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:30,029
measurement cycle on all N qubits.

744
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:33,032
So you can think of Alice preparing the N

745
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:33,032
qubits, bob measuring the N qubits, and

746
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:33,032
then Bob preparing and Alice measuring,

747
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:33,032
and that allows them to exchange N bit

748
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:44,043
messages.

749
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:47,046
And we can make N as large as we want.

750
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:50,049
And so they can exchange messages of

751
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:52,051
arbitrary complexity.

752
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:55,054
And if they share the meaning of up and

753
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:55,054
down, then they can exchange these

754
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:55,054
messages with no noise, so they can

755
00:37:55,054 --> 00:38:01,054
communicate.

756
00:38:02,055 --> 00:38:05,058
And we now have our theory of two

757
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,058
communicating agents that are that are

758
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:14,067
sharing arbitrary finite information.

759
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:18,071
Now, I've labeled Q one through QN in

760
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:22,075
this picture, a holographic screen.

761
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:26,079
And in fact, that's exactly what it is.

762
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,083
Recall from session one this slide

763
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:33,085
illustrating the holographic principle.

764
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:38,091
Shannon made this point that a bit of

765
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:38,091
information is an answer to a yes no

766
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:41,094
question.

767
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:46,099
And so we can write down a number of

768
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,100
possible states.

769
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,103
We can write down an entropy.

770
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:55,108
And the limiting case of that entropy is

771
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:58,111
the entropy of a black hole.

772
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:03,110
The densest possible encoding of

773
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:09,116
information in space or on a boundary.

774
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:13,120
And this holographic principle allows us

775
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,120
to see any boundary, as we discuss in

776
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:20,127
session one, as an encoding of bits.

777
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:23,130
So the previous boundary of these in

778
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,130
qubits, we can think of as a holographic

779
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:28,134
screen.

780
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:31,138
Now, why is that important?

781
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:38,145
It's important because it allows us to

782
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:38,145
use this idea of holography and this idea

783
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:38,145
of a fixed encoding of a message or a

784
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:38,145
fixed encoding of an observable entropy

785
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:38,145
at some density that was developed in

786
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:38,145
cosmology to talk about arbitrary quantum

787
00:39:38,145 --> 00:40:02,163
communication channels.

788
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:05,166
So we can import a whole bunch of theory

789
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:05,166
that was done someplace else into quantum

790
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:05,166
information theory and see that it works

791
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:05,166
perfectly because it describes exactly

792
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:14,175
the same situation.

793
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:18,179
Now, what does this tell us?

794
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,184
Philosophically, it tells us that Alice

795
00:40:23,184 --> 00:40:23,184
and Bob can learn about each other at

796
00:40:23,184 --> 00:40:31,192
most N bits per communication cycle.

797
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:36,197
So the maximal amount of information that

798
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:36,197
they can get from an observation is the

799
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:36,197
in bits that the other one wrote on the

800
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:43,204
screen.

801
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:48,209
So this tells us something very important,

802
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:48,209
, that when an agent is looking at their

803
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:48,209
environment, which is this other agent,

804
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:48,209
Bob, the amount of information that can

805
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:48,209
be extracted from the environment is

806
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:48,209
actually proportional to the size in bits

807
00:40:48,209 --> 00:41:04,219
of the boundary.

808
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,223
And the holographic principle just makes

809
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:10,225
that size finite in space.

810
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:13,228
And I said early on that there's no

811
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:13,228
embedding spacetime in this theory, that

812
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:13,228
Alice and Bob are not thought of as

813
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:20,235
separated in space.

814
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:23,238
But as soon as we use the holographic

815
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:23,238
principle, we can think of the boundary

816
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:23,238
between them as having a spatial

817
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:23,238
coordinate, even though they don't have a

818
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:31,246
spatial coordinate.

819
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:34,249
So we'll get back to this point in

820
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:34,249
September when we talk about theories of

821
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:34,249
emergent spacetime, but all of these

822
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:34,249
theories of emergent spacetime come back

823
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:34,249
to this idea that boundaries can have

824
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:34,249
spatial extent, even though the systems

825
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:34,249
that they separate don't have any natural

826
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:34,249
spatial description or natural spatial

827
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:59,274
degrees of freedom.

828
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:06,275
Okay, so now let's recall another picture

829
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:08,277
from session one.

830
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:14,283
We talked a little bit about Feynman's

831
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
theory of scattering and the origin of

832
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
Feynman diagrams and the idea that if

833
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
Alice prepares some system in some

834
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
initial state and then measures the state

835
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
later, if we want to calculate what the

836
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:37,306
new state is.

837
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:41,310
We have to take into account all of the

838
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:41,310
possible paths that join the initial

839
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:41,310
state that Alice prepared to the final

840
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:48,317
state that Alice measured.

841
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,321
So what does that mean?

842
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:55,324
I mean, here effectively, if we think of

843
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:55,324
suppose I'm Alice and the boundary is my

844
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:55,324
screen, I'm talking to the screen, and

845
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:55,324
then later on, I'm going to measure the

846
00:42:55,324 --> 00:43:06,329
screen.

847
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,333
And between my preparation actions and my

848
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:10,333
measurement actions, a bunch of stuff

849
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:15,338
happens on the other side of the screen.

850
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:19,342
And if I want to predict what's going to

851
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:19,342
happen on the other side of the screen, I'

852
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:19,342
've got to take into account every

853
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:25,348
possible thing.

854
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:26,349
That could happen.

855
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:30,353
And I have to give some weight to those

856
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:33,356
possible things that could happen.

857
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:36,359
And Quantum theory, in fact, tells you

858
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:36,359
how to assign those weights to things

859
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:36,359
that could happen in order to make a

860
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:36,359
measurement, given some theory of the

861
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:45,368
mechanism that makes things happen.

862
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:49,372
But the fact that all of the paths have

863
00:43:49,372 --> 00:43:49,372
to be counted is what unitary evolution

864
00:43:49,372 --> 00:43:52,375
means.

865
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:55,378
This evolution that preserves information

866
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
that doesn't take any away, it doesn't

867
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
add any, it just represents it in

868
00:43:55,378 --> 00:44:01,378
different ways.

869
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:04,381
So if you look at this screen and imagine

870
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:04,381
that Alice is interacting with her

871
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:04,381
boundary and then she's interacting with

872
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:04,381
her boundary again, it looks just like

873
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:14,391
the previous screen.

874
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:17,394
And the wavy red arrows are what's

875
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:19,396
happening inside Bob.

876
00:44:20,397 --> 00:44:23,400
The wavy red arrows are a representation

877
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
of what's going on inside Bob as he

878
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
measures his side of the screen and then

879
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:31,408
prepares his side of the screen.

880
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:35,412
So what Feynman is representing here is

881
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:35,412
just the action of the environment or the

882
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:35,412
action of the system while Alice isn't

883
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:44,421
looking.

884
00:44:44,421 --> 00:44:47,424
Between Alice's preparation stage and her

885
00:44:47,424 --> 00:44:47,424
measurement stage, while Bob is doing his

886
00:44:47,424 --> 00:44:53,429
measurement and preparation.

887
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,432
So this diagram is actually completely

888
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:56,433
symmetrical.

889
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:59,436
We could have drawn an arrow where the

890
00:44:59,436 --> 00:44:59,436
wavy red things are and drawn wavy red

891
00:44:59,436 --> 00:45:04,435
things where we talked about Alice.

892
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,438
And we'd have the same picture just from

893
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,439
Bob's point of view.

894
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,443
We can also think of this, of course, as

895
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:12,443
Alice communicating with her future self

896
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:12,443
by writing a memory record someplace in

897
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:12,443
the world and then coming back and

898
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:22,453
reading it.

899
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,457
And if Alice writes a memory on the world

900
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:26,457
and then comes back later on and reads it,

901
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:26,457
, she actually has to take into account

902
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:26,457
some theory of all of the things the

903
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:26,457
world might have done to her memory while

904
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:39,470
she wasn't looking.

905
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:44,475
So this picture of Feynman's actually

906
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,477
tells us a lot about memory.

907
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,481
And when we think about organisms running

908
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:50,481
around in the world doing things like we

909
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:50,481
do all the time, we tend to think of

910
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:50,481
memories as things that are persistent

911
00:45:50,481 --> 00:46:02,487
and unchanging and all of that.

912
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:04,489
But we know that that's not true.

913
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,493
We know that memories degrade in various

914
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:08,493
ways.

915
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:12,497
We know that adversarial third parties

916
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:12,497
can come and change what we've done so

917
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:12,497
that they fool us into thinking that we'

918
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:12,497
've remembered something that we haven't.

919
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:21,506
.

920
00:46:21,506 --> 00:46:23,508
And so on and so forth.

921
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:27,512
That whole picture of memory is actually

922
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:27,512
encoded in this picture that Feynman drew

923
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:27,512
in the late fifty S to represent

924
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:36,521
scattering of particles.

925
00:46:40,525 --> 00:46:43,528
So what we've done here is started with

926
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:47,531
this simple idea of asking questions.

927
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:50,535
And we've actually constructed a fair

928
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:52,537
amount of Quantum theory.

929
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:54,539
We constructed the Schrodinger equation,

930
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:56,541
we constructed the unitary propagator.

931
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:59,544
We constructed the idea of a reference

932
00:46:59,544 --> 00:46:59,544
frame, which we'll talk about intensely

933
00:46:59,544 --> 00:47:04,543
next time in July.

934
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:08,547
So we can sum this up by saying that

935
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:08,547
Quantum theory simply is a theory of

936
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:12,551
communicating agents.

937
00:47:13,552 --> 00:47:16,555
And that quantum mechanics, the theory

938
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:16,555
that Feynman was complaining about in

939
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:16,555
that earlier slide, that quantum

940
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:16,555
mechanics generates this problem that

941
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:16,555
seems intractable of how to understand

942
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:16,555
measurement, because the theory is in

943
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:34,573
fact about measurement.

944
00:47:34,573 --> 00:47:37,576
It's not about mechanical motion at all.

945
00:47:38,577 --> 00:47:41,580
So quantum theory actually tells us

946
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,581
nothing about ontology.

947
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:46,585
And this is why the interpretations of

948
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:46,585
quantum theory, the many worlds

949
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:46,585
interpretation, where you have all these

950
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:46,585
branching universes and so forth, are not

951
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:55,594
really science.

952
00:47:55,594 --> 00:47:57,596
They're philosophy.

953
00:47:57,596 --> 00:47:59,598
They're attempts to understand an

954
00:47:59,598 --> 00:47:59,598
ontology that's generated by a theory

955
00:47:59,598 --> 00:48:05,598
that doesn't talk about ontology.

956
00:48:05,598 --> 00:48:08,601
It talks about communication between

957
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:08,601
agents.

958
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:12,605
But we've left something very important

959
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:12,605
out.

960
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:15,608
We've left out a consideration of what

961
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:15,608
happens when Alice and Bob don't mean the

962
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:20,613
same thing by up and down.

963
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:24,617
And we've left out the famous phenomenon

964
00:48:24,617 --> 00:48:24,617
of entanglement spooky action at a

965
00:48:24,617 --> 00:48:30,623
distance, as Einstein called it.

966
00:48:30,623 --> 00:48:32,625
And it turns out these things that we've

967
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:34,627
left out are very, very closely related.

968
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:39,632
And we're going to see why in July.

969
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:42,635
But I'm going to give you a brief preview

970
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:42,635
now.

971
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:45,638
So what happens when Alice and Bob

972
00:48:45,638 --> 00:48:45,638
actually mean different things by up and

973
00:48:45,638 --> 00:48:48,641
down?

974
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:51,643
What if their reference frames aren't

975
00:48:51,643 --> 00:48:51,644
aligned?

976
00:48:52,645 --> 00:48:54,647
Well, the first thing to note is that

977
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:54,647
nothing in the theory says they have to

978
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:57,650
be aligned.

979
00:48:58,651 --> 00:49:00,647
So we have to consider the possibility

980
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:01,648
that they're not.

981
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:05,652
And in fact, both Alice and Bob have to

982
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:05,652
have what's called free choice of

983
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:09,656
reference frame.

984
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:11,658
When Alice prepares her instrument, she

985
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:11,658
has to be able to prepare it any way she

986
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:17,664
wants to in order to do an experiment.

987
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,669
And when Bob makes up a sentence to tell

988
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:22,669
Alice, he has to be able to choose any

989
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:22,669
language he wants to use, he's a free

990
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:31,678
agent in this way.

991
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:34,681
And if they don't have that freedom, it

992
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:35,682
turns out they're entangled.

993
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:38,685
So reference frame, nonalignment and

994
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:38,685
entanglement are very, very closely

995
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,688
coupled.

996
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:47,694
Now, misalignment of reference frames is

997
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:47,694
what produces superpositions of outcomes.

998
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:51,698
.

999
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:55,702
So if Alice makes her measurements with

1000
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:55,702
her up and down arrow arranged vertically,

1001
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:55,702
, for example, but Bob prepares his qubit

1002
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:55,702
with his up and down arrow arranged at 90

1003
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:55,702
degrees to Alice's, alice is not going to

1004
00:49:55,702 --> 00:50:14,715
have any idea what Bob did.

1005
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:17,718
I mean, she can't see distinctions in the

1006
00:50:17,718 --> 00:50:18,719
left right direction.

1007
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:21,722
She can only see distinctions in the up

1008
00:50:21,722 --> 00:50:22,723
and down direction.

1009
00:50:22,723 --> 00:50:25,726
So all she can do is flip a coin.

1010
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:30,731
If she wants to know what Bob prepared,

1011
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:30,731
it's 50% likely he prepared up for her

1012
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:36,737
what she calls one.

1013
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:39,740
And it's 50% likely that he prepared what'

1014
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,742
's down for her.

1015
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:42,743
She can't tell.

1016
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:47,748
Now, if Bob's reference frame is pointing

1017
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:49,750
at about 45 degrees.

1018
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:53,754
So up for him means 45 degrees off of

1019
00:50:53,754 --> 00:50:53,754
Alice's up, then she can sort of tell

1020
00:50:53,754 --> 00:50:57,758
what he did.

1021
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:02,757
If he's pointing 45 degrees from up, then

1022
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:06,761
she's probably going to measure up.

1023
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:08,763
And if he's pointing 45 degrees from down,

1024
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:11,766
, she's probably going to measure down.

1025
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:15,770
So her outcomes are 75% for one and 25%

1026
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,772
for minus one.

1027
00:51:17,772 --> 00:51:21,776
If he prepares at this 45 degree angle.

1028
00:51:22,777 --> 00:51:24,779
So we can write this in a particular way.

1029
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:24,779
.

1030
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:28,783
We can say that the value that Alice gets

1031
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:28,783
acting with her M on a qubit that Bob

1032
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:28,783
prepared is some number times what she

1033
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:28,783
measures as up plus some other number

1034
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:28,783
plus times what she measures as minus one,

1035
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:28,783
, where those numbers, the squares of

1036
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:46,801
those numbers, add to one.

1037
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:48,803
So why do they have to add to one?

1038
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:50,805
Well, they add to one because of the

1039
00:51:50,805 --> 00:51:51,806
Pythagorean theorem.

1040
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:58,812
One is the distance, the total distance

1041
00:51:58,812 --> 00:52:00,809
between the two outcomes.

1042
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,813
And A squared plus B squared are the

1043
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:07,816
other two sides of that triangle.

1044
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:13,822
So another way to think of it is that the

1045
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:13,822
metric distance in possibility space is

1046
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:13,822
one and A squared and B squared are just

1047
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:26,835
the Euclidean distance components.

1048
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:28,837
Again, Euclidean distance is based on the

1049
00:52:28,837 --> 00:52:29,838
Pythagorean theorem.

1050
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,841
So this is the Born rule in quantum

1051
00:52:32,841 --> 00:52:33,842
theory.

1052
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:36,845
It's the rule that tells us what happens

1053
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:36,845
when we're trying to measure a

1054
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:36,845
superposition and it tells us where these

1055
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:42,851
superpositions come from.

1056
00:52:44,853 --> 00:52:46,855
We have a mismatch in reference frames

1057
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:46,855
between two agents that are communicating.

1058
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:50,859
.

1059
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:55,864
So if we go back to the free energy

1060
00:52:55,864 --> 00:52:55,864
principle, which is what this whole

1061
00:52:55,864 --> 00:52:55,864
active inference class is about, and we

1062
00:52:55,864 --> 00:52:55,864
formulate it in quantum theory, we get a

1063
00:52:55,864 --> 00:52:55,864
very simple idea of what the free energy

1064
00:52:55,864 --> 00:53:09,872
principle is.

1065
00:53:09,872 --> 00:53:12,875
The FEP and quantum theory just says that

1066
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:12,875
interacting systems are going to behave

1067
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:12,875
in a way that aligns their reference

1068
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:12,875
frames and that makes their communication

1069
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:21,884
as good as it can be.

1070
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:26,889
But since aligning reference frames

1071
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:26,889
perfectly leads to entanglement, the free

1072
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:26,889
energy principle drives systems

1073
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:37,900
asymptotically toward entanglement.

1074
00:53:39,902 --> 00:53:42,905
Well, the principle of unitarity says

1075
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:42,905
that all systems will approach

1076
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:46,909
entanglement asymptotically.

1077
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:49,912
So we can see the FEP is actually a

1078
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:49,912
classical statement of the principle of

1079
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:52,915
unitarity.

1080
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:56,919
And what we'll see in the next session is

1081
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
why this is the case, why active

1082
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
inference, when we think of it, quantum

1083
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
mechanically is a way of talking about

1084
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
the principle of unitarity, which is the

1085
00:53:56,919 --> 00:54:09,926
deepest axiom of quantum theory.

1086
00:54:10,927 --> 00:54:14,931
And we'll also see that this question of

1087
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:14,931
alignment becomes more and more complex

1088
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:14,931
as the complexity of the messages that

1089
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:14,931
the systems are trying to communicate to

1090
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:25,942
each other increases.

1091
00:54:26,943 --> 00:54:29,946
And that message complexity correlates

1092
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:30,947
with system complexity.

1093
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:34,951
So that aligning complicated systems is

1094
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:34,951
very hard, although aligning very simple

1095
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:39,956
systems is fairly easy.

1096
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:42,959
And if you think about what's the

1097
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:42,959
simplest possible theory in science, it's

1098
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:42,959
particle physics, because you're dealing

1099
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:42,959
with these very simple things that

1100
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:53,970
interact in extremely simple ways.

1101
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:56,973
And the really difficult parts of science

1102
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:56,973
are things like sociology, where you're

1103
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:56,973
dealing with incredibly complicated

1104
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:56,973
systems like humans that interact in

1105
00:54:56,973 --> 00:55:06,977
incredibly complicated ways.

1106
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:09,980
And all we have are very vague kind of

1107
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,983
folk theories of how that works.

1108
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:15,986
But we know from that example that

1109
00:55:15,986 --> 00:55:15,986
aligning complex systems is extremely

1110
00:55:15,986 --> 00:55:19,990
difficult.

1111
00:55:21,992 --> 00:55:24,995
So humans don't get along very well.

1112
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:28,998
So the second session well, the second

1113
00:55:28,998 --> 00:55:28,998
discussion section which Andrew will be

1114
00:55:28,998 --> 00:55:28,998
leading is on Saturday, the 1 July, a

1115
00:55:28,998 --> 00:55:34,005
couple of weeks from now.

1116
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:39,010
The third lecture session will be on July

1117
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:39,010
13 and I hope you all will contribute to

1118
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:39,010
the interactive question and answer

1119
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:39,010
session on the web and show up for the

1120
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:39,010
discussion on Saturday, the 1 July and

1121
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:39,010
join us again in July for the discussion

1122
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:39,010
of quantum reference frames and reference

1123
00:55:39,010 --> 00:56:01,026
frame alignment.

1124
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:03,028
So thank you very much.

1125
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:10,035
Daniel: Thank you, Chris.

1126
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:12,037
Ander: All right.

1127
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:14,039
Daniel: Thank you all again.

1128
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:17,042
Please check out the course syllabus, ask

1129
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:17,042
questions through the site and see you at

1130
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:22,046
the discussion.

1131
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:23,048
See you next time.

1132
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:24,049
Thank you.

1133
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
Bye.
