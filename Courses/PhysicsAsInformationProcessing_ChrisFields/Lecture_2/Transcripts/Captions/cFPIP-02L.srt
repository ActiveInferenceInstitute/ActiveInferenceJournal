00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,870
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,148
It's June 15th, 2023.

3
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:19,280
We are here in lecture two of Chris Field's course: Physics as Information Processing.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:19,700
So,

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,040
Thank you, Chris.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,460
Looking forward to the lecture.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,660
Thank you, Daniel.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,380
And, yes, welcome to this session.

9
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:34,300
This section is titled "Why Quantum Physics?".

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:54,560
And, if you will recall, from the first session, we reviewed the History of Physics and some of the History of Mathematics and Computer Science, from the end of the 19th century through to the beginning of the 21st century.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:30,808
And, we discussed the slow development from classical thermodynamics of Quantum Information Theory and specifically we characterized Quantum Information Theory as a new kind of physics that describes systems that are exchanging finite amounts of discretely encoded information across some intervening boundary.

12
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:52,928
And so, we use this very conventional graphical notation of two agents or physical systems, Alice and Bob (A and B), that are exchanging energy and information across some boundary.

13
00:01:53,104 --> 00:02:00,680
And I always use a blue ellipse like this to indicate the boundary that separates Alice from Bob.

14
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,884
And, this new approach to physics is entirely topological.

15
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:10,840
It's not geometric.

16
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:20,620
So, it doesn't assume a particular background spacetime. So, it doesn't assume that Alice and Bob are spatially separated.

17
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:39,844
And, so, this makes it a very different kind of theory from Classical Information Theory in that the channel that separates Alice from Bob, this boundary, is a boundary in state space.

18
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:44,612
It's not a boundary in some geometric embedding space.

19
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:53,880
And, in particular, it's not a boundary or a channel that's embedded in a three-dimensional space that separates Alice from Bob.

20
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:14,770
So, that's what we talked about last time. And today, what I want to discuss is how Quantum Theory in particular makes this idea of physics as a theory of communication simple and obvious.

21
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:31,590
And, Quantum Theory, of course, has a terrible reputation of being abstruse and mathematically incredibly complicated and counterintuitive and difficult to understand.

22
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:44,490
And, this is one quotation among many from leading physicists pointing out that quantum mechanics is just difficult.

23
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:59,580
And, as you probably know, there's an entire philosophical industry of interpretations of Quantum Theory that try to make sense of its ontology.

24
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,720
And so, what I don't want to do today is try to introduce quantum mechanics.

25
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,730
We're not doing any of this.

26
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:24,660
Some of you will recognize this as the table of contents, the first part of the table of contents of the famous textbook by Landau and Lifshitz.

27
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:35,930
If you've studied Quantum Theory in undergraduate or graduate school, you've probably dealt with a textbook structured much like this one.

28
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:54,530
And, you've probably been introduced to quantum mechanics as it was traditionally conceived: as essentially a mechanical theory, a theory of motion, with wave functions and particle representations, and on, and on, and on.

29
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,264
So, we're not going to try to do that

30
00:04:57,382 --> 00:05:18,810
(this). What we're going to do instead is take a completely information theoretical approach, and we're going to characterize information transfer in a quantum theoretical way without any assumptions about mechanics or spacetime or any of that.

31
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,770
So, instead of this, we're going to ask a simple question.

32
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,788
By a simple question, I mean a question with just a "yes-no" answer or a binary answer.

33
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:36,670
So, let's use "up or down" as our example question.

34
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,070
And, to ask this question, we need three things:

35
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,932
First, we need an action.

36
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:46,290
We need a way of asking it.

37
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,730
For example, making a sound or writing something down.

38
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,030
Second, we need a thing that we can ask the question of.

39
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:13,930
We need an environment or a friend or the rest of the world or an experimental apparatus or some system or other that we're going to act on to ask this question.

40
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,100
And, the third thing that we need to ask this question is a shared language.

41
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:29,100
And, it's the shared language that's often neglected in models based on physics.

42
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,300
And, I think the importance of the shared language became clear in Classical Information Theory.

43
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,572
And, it's become clear again, of course, in Quantum Information Theory.

44
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:44,080
But this has only happened over the last few decades.

45
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:58,664
So, what I want to do today is to construct in a step-by-step fashion a formal representation of these three things that we need to ask a simple question.

46
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:04,628
And, what we'll find is that that formal representation is, in fact, Quantum Theory.

47
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:15,436
So, it's the Quantum Theory that provides us with a formal representation of asking these simple binary questions.

48
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:21,950
And of course, if you can ask a binary question, you can ask any finite number of binary questions.

49
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:35,670
So, you can construct an arbitrarily complex, finite decision tree that ends up formulating an arbitrarily complex but still finite question.

50
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:42,870
So, this really is a general model of communicative interactions between agents.

51
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,104
So, let's go about this. And, talk first about the action of asking you a question.

52
00:07:52,222 --> 00:08:08,030
And, so, the first thing I want you to do is actually say out loud "up or down?". Actually, ask a question, and then note two things about what just happened.

53
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,856
The first thing to note is that it took some time to do that.

54
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:23,970
That action actually required a finite amount of time, a couple of seconds, not very long, but it's not zero.

55
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,590
It always takes time to ask a question.

56
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,870
And the second thing to note is that it took energy to actually say "up or down".

57
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,650
It requires a little bit of exertion to ask a question.

58
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,920
So, let's put those two together and define a word.

59
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:53,596
We're going to define the word "action" to mean some energy that's been spent in some time.

60
00:08:53,778 --> 00:09:04,944
So, asking a question is an action and it qualifies as an action because it requires spending some energy in some finite amount of time.

61
00:09:05,142 --> 00:09:09,170
And, so, we can write this as action equals energy times time.

62
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,730
Or I'll sometimes use the abbreviation E times T.

63
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:31,736
And, action is always required when there's some inter-action or two-way-action between systems.

64
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:43,330
So, whenever we talk about physical interaction, we're always talking about two systems doing something to each other that requires both energy and time.

65
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,220
So, let's define another concept.

66
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:55,750
A concept of a minimum action needed to ask a question, and, specifically, a question with a binary answer.

67
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,696
And, we'll just pick a symbol to stand for that minimum action.

68
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:05,590
And the symbol we'll use because it's conventional is "h".

69
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:29,260
And it turns out that this h is Planck's constant, the number that Planck came up with when he was trying to solve the black-body problem back in 1900 that we talked about last time. And, recall that was the problem of characterizing the spectrum of radiation emitted by some physical system that was hot.

70
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,920
How much energy comes out as a function of temperature.

71
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:42,304
And, if you assume that the spectrum of energy coming out is continuous, you get predictions that are wrong.

72
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:58,824
And, Planck got predictions that were correct by assuming that that spectrum was discrete and that this h represented the minimum amount of energy that could be emitted in a particular time.

73
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:03,400
So, it represented the minimum energy times time or action.

74
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,490
So, let's look at an example of that.

75
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,976
And, here's an example that may be familiar.

76
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:13,310
It's the example of your own visual system.

77
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:35,750
So, in the retinal, the cells of your retinas, there are many, many molecules that are rhodopsins (of one variety or other) that respond to different wavelengths of visible light. And they have some efficiency for capturing light.

78
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:43,430
And, let's just assume that they're optimally efficient, that they're as efficient as they could possibly be.

79
00:11:44,200 --> 00:12:07,372
And that means that they require the minimum amount of energy to change shape, which is what they do when they're impacted by light, to capture the energy and hence the information that's available in the light. And, the minimum energy to do anything that records one bit of information, so yes or no, up or down, is 0.7.

80
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:19,760
So, log two of Boltzman's constant times the temperature.

81
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,370
And again, we saw this last time.

82
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:40,340
This is from roughly 1875 and was then built into Classical Information Theory by Shannon and then by Landauer in the mid-20th century.

83
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:49,720
So, what we're doing is assuming that, since rhodopsin is optimally efficient, all it requires is this amount of energy to change shape.

84
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,944
And, it's known experimentally, that rhodopsin takes about 200 femtoseconds to change shape.

85
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:59,436
So, that's 200 times ten to the -15

86
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:00,392
seconds.

87
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:04,320
So, it's a very, very fast reaction, chemical reaction.

88
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:27,910
So, we can just calculate what the action is. And, at 37 degrees centigrade, so human body temperature, KT is about 4.3 times 10 to the -21 Joule, and Joule is just a standard unit of energy. And, so we can multiply everything together:

89
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,992
KT times 0.7 times this response time of 200 femtoseconds. Multiplied together gives you an action of about 6 times 10 to the -34 joule seconds.

90
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:56,604
And, if you're familiar with quantum mechanics, you'll instantly recognize that number because it's very close to the value of Planck's Constant, which is 6.6 times 10 to the -34 Joule seconds.

91
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,720
So, this says that rhodopsin is very near to optimal.

92
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,736
The best it would be able to do would be Planck's constant.

93
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:14,180
That's the minimum action that can be undertaken.

94
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,290
So rhodopsin is clearly doing very well.

95
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:28,840
It can't be as efficient as we're assuming it to be, but it's pretty efficient.

96
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:37,868
So, this number Planck's constant (is) and this idea of a minimum action is not something we just pulled out of the air.

97
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:40,216
It's something that one can observe.

98
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:48,290
When you're looking at what real biological systems in particular do, and other physical systems do.

99
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:57,380
So, let's think about the second component of this project of asking a question.

100
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,830
And, that's the thing to be asked.

101
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,348
And, we want to ask a very simple question.

102
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:06,870
We want to have a theory of asking very simple questions.

103
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:15,290
So, let's define the simplest thing that we can ask a binary question to.

104
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:23,484
And, let's say this is the thing that we can ask a binary question of using just this minimum action h.

105
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:30,030
So, we're going to ask for the minimal thing that it's possible physically to ask a question of.

106
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,160
And, this thing needs a name, so let's call it a "qubit".

107
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,210
And, that word is a contraction of "quantum bit".

108
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,832
And, we can draw it like this.

109
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:43,104
A little sphere with an arrow through it.

110
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:45,380
That's called a "block sphere".

111
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,504
And, we use a symbol |q>.

112
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:57,556
And, that notation with the bar and the angle bracket is called a "bra notation".

113
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:00,228
And, it originates with Durac.

114
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:12,350
So, it's a traditional way of writing inner products, actually, in Quantum Theory to indicate the state of q.

115
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:20,556
So, this thing called a qubit only responds to binary questions.

116
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:23,776
So, it clearly can have only two states.

117
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:27,410
The state that answers yes and the state that answers no.

118
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,440
And, conventionally, we draw the arrow going up if the answer is yes and the arrow going down if the answer is no.

119
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:43,350
And, so those are the two states that the qubit can be in when it's answered a question.

120
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:51,480
So, now let's draw a picture for the act of asking a question of |q> in the state q, and let's draw it like this.

121
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:01,596
This curvy arrow is the action of asking the question and getting the answer back.

122
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:05,740
And, we're asking it of this minimum system, the qubit.

123
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:18,080
And, let's call this entire act of H and write H acting on |q> by this expression H|q>.

124
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:28,660
So again, we're developing the notation of Quantum Theory, which all of you who know the theory already will find familiar.

125
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:38,360
So, the third thing that we have to build into this picture and into the theory is the shared language.

126
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:48,810
So, we have to know what we mean by "up" or "down" if we're going to ask the question "up or down?".

127
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,110
And, we have to have some representation of what it means for the qubit to distinguish up or down.

128
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:14,560
So, let's say that to us, "up" and "down" mean this little diagram with an arrow that's labeled "up" on one end and "down" on the other end.

129
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,048
So, we're defining "up" and "down" in a very simple way as just opposites.

130
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:23,888
We don't know anything else about them except that they're opposites.

131
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:27,412
So, this is a stripped-down one-bit question.

132
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:30,296
We could have called them 1 and -1.

133
00:18:30,478 --> 00:18:32,312
We could have called them A and B.

134
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:33,930
We could have called them anything.

135
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,460
We're just indicating that up and down are two opposing concepts.

136
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:53,760
And so, this object that we've used to make this definition of the relationship between our two words (up and down) is called a reference frame.

137
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:03,120
It's a physical object that encodes a concept or a meaning.

138
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:25,160
And, if you think about using language, using English, for example, you can understand me speaking in English because your brain has the right sorts of neural circuits to allow you to understand English and produce English using your hand and your mouth.

139
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:34,616
And, those neural circuits are reference frames in your brain for understanding and producing English.

140
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:38,270
And, they encode the relationships between different words.

141
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,040
So, you all know about Chat GPT.

142
00:19:43,540 --> 00:20:01,940
You can think of all of the weights on all of the 10th to the 19th or however many parameters there are in GPT-4 as a reference frame that describes the relationships between words and phrases in English and many other languages.

143
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:14,452
So, this idea of a reference frame is an instance of Landauer's principle, which is often summarized as saying that "information is physical".

144
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:28,700
What that means is that information always has to have some encoding and that encoding, that object, can always be thought of as a reference frame.

145
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,950
So, let's put all this stuff together.

146
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:40,208
What we have now is a reference frame that defines the difference between up and down.

147
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:51,110
We have an action that we've labeled h, and the action acts on this object, the qubit, which is in some state.

148
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,900
And, what we've drawn here now is an experiment.

149
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:08,324
And, you can think of the incoming part of the arrow that goes from the reference frame to the qubit as a preparation of the qubit.

150
00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:20,590
So, you can think of it as I'm doing something to the qubit to put it in a particular state like up because that's the state I want it to be in.

151
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:30,930
And I can think of this returning part of the arrow as a measurement of the state that the qubit is actually in.

152
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:42,930
So, if the qubit is actually in this state with the arrow pointing up, then I'm going to get back the answer up when I act on the qubit to measure its state.

153
00:21:44,420 --> 00:22:08,556
So, now we can recognize this action H as the Hamiltonian operator in Quantum Theory, which always takes some time, which we represent by an interval dt, to act on some state and in particular this binary state, |q>.

154
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:15,360
So, this whole picture depicts the action of a very simple Hamiltonian operator.

155
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:26,070
And again, I want to emphasize that we've just defined the qubit as the simplest thing that we can ask a binary question of.

156
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,110
So how does this H work?

157
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:41,450
We can use H to prepare this qubit in one of two states, which we're going to label "1" and "-1".

158
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:55,292
The state 1 corresponds to the up direction, and the state -1 corresponds to the down direction. And, doing this to |q>, so, preparing |q> in one of these two states takes energy, and we know how much.

159
00:23:02,454 --> 00:23:14,556
Boltzman told us back in 1875 that the minimum energy to reduce the entropy of the universe by one bit is log two of KT.

160
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:18,720
We saw that earlier when we were thinking about rhodopsin.

161
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:29,864
So, we can say that acting with H always requires some number times KT, where that number is bigger than the log of two.

162
00:23:29,982 --> 00:23:51,612
Remember, the log of two is just in there to get units of bits of binary questions, as opposed to units of nats, which are questions that have e answers, where e is the exponential base, the natural exponential base.

163
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:57,010
But we want to use units of bits, so we have to always have this factor of log two.

164
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,480
So, this lets us write H in a particular way.

165
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:12,900
We can take out this energetic term that Boltzman tells us we have to include beta times KT.

166
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:22,868
And, what's left over is, in a sense, the pure representation of the action, stripping out the energy requirement.

167
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:32,380
And, we're going to call that M, because M is the standard symbol to use in Quantum Theory for a measurement operator.

168
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,552
And, M is now dimensionless.

169
00:24:36,696 --> 00:24:47,712
H has units of energy, KT is an energy, and M has no units at all.

170
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:50,290
So, it's H without the energy.

171
00:24:51,300 --> 00:25:05,220
So, now we can ask, what is this operator M that we've defined as the simplest possible action on a qubit, but abstracting away the amount of energy that we have to use to act on the qubit.

172
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,490
Well, what M does is just encode a bit or decode a bit.

173
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:20,760
So, we can use this operator M to say: I want Q to have the value 1.

174
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:30,030
I want it to be up, so I can sort of reach out with my operator M and grab |q> and turn it so that its arrow is pointing up.

175
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,332
And that's the operation.

176
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:36,284
That's called preparation in physics.

177
00:25:36,332 --> 00:25:39,644
It's what it means to prepare an experimental apparatus.

178
00:25:39,692 --> 00:25:48,070
For example, you actually grab hold of the apparatus, and you twist some knobs, and flick some switches to prepare it to be in some state.

179
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,160
And you can use M to measure a state that isn't known.

180
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:05,290
So, I can use M to grab a hold of |q> and look at it and determine whether it's in state 1 or -1.

181
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:14,940
And, I can represent these as just a cycle that starts with measuring and then preparing, or that starts with preparing and then measuring.

182
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:29,052
And, if I represent it that way, what I see is M having a value which is either the value I want to encode or the value that I have measured.

183
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:43,510
And q and M act on that value and q to produce a particular state of q, to put q in a particular state, or to realize that q is in that state.

184
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:53,000
And so, M is actually an identity acting on some value and q.

185
00:26:53,150 --> 00:27:04,664
So it maps 1 in |q> to 1 in |q>, and it maps -1 in |q> to -1 in |q> if you do the whole cycle of preparation and then measurement.

186
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:05,852
And that makes sense.

187
00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:19,024
It's actually an axiom in some formulations of Quantum Theory that if I measure the state of some object, what I'm doing is also preparing it in that state.

188
00:27:19,142 --> 00:27:23,010
So, if I immediately measure it again, I'll see the same value.

189
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,512
And that makes sense physically.

190
00:27:26,576 --> 00:27:35,540
If I, you know, put my coffee cup on the table and then I look for it, it's likely going to be on the table unless something else intervenes.

191
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,464
Well, what does this mean?

192
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:40,280
It means that we can do a little bit of algebra.

193
00:27:42,860 --> 00:28:00,670
It means that we can write this original expression of acting on q with our Hamiltonian in this somewhat more explicit form of using the energy beta KT and our operator M|q>.

194
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:07,890
And what I get out of that is the energy beta KT multiplied by |q>.

195
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,360
So H|q> equals E|q>.

196
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,180
That's the Schrodinger equation.

197
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,016
So that's one of the central equations of Quantum Theory.

198
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:27,450
What it says is that this operator, H, is the total energy operator on a system.

199
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,344
Its eigenvalues are the total energies of the system.

200
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:43,576
And, we can now see where that energy is coming from in this very, very simple, stripped-down kind of representation of an action.

201
00:28:43,768 --> 00:28:52,930
The energy is the thermodynamic energy that has to be spent to determine one binary outcome (up or down).

202
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:06,500
Now, if you're familiar with quantum mechanics, you will have seen exponentiated operators like the next line here of algebra.

203
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:22,420
This operator P, which is time-dependent and which is the exponential of H multiplied by it over H bar, is called the propagator.

204
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:30,190
It's the unitary operator in Quantum Theory, the operator that conserves probability or conserves information.

205
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:45,730
And so, using the representation of H as beta KT, we can see that this operator P is just E to the minus beta M.

206
00:29:47,460 --> 00:30:03,540
If we recall the Wick rotation from the first session, this strange equivalence of it over H bar with one over KT (that) wasn't discovered until 50 years after the invention of Quantum Theory.

207
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,960
And it's still a very debated thing.

208
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,850
I mean, people worry about what this equation really means.

209
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:36,690
But one thing that it means in this setting where H has this particularly simple form is that the propagator is now just the exponential of a number multiplied by this very simple strip-down operator that encodes a bit or decodes a bit.

210
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,480
But we know something about the exponential propagator just by looking at its form.

211
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:48,740
If you're again familiar with these sorts of exponential operators, you know that they're wave equations.

212
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,608
And we can make sense of that using the diagram up above.

213
00:30:54,784 --> 00:30:59,160
What M is doing is just performing a cycle.

214
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:07,850
It's just mapping 1 and |q> back to itself, or -1 and |q> back to itself.

215
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:24,290
So we can think of M as just taking this object and flipping it back around until it gets itself again.

216
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:34,608
And that kind of cycle can always be turned into a wave equation and e to the i over h bar times Ht is a canonical form of a wave equation, where the horizontal axis here on the wave is time.

217
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:57,370
Or if you look at the little cycle that I've drawn as a circle with an arrow, it's the time of the thing spinning around like this, which is exactly the same thing as a wave traveling through time.

218
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,070
So, that tells us something very important.

219
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:09,340
It tells us that this equivalent expression, e to the minus beta M, is also a wave equation.

220
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:17,170
So it tells us that this operator M has built into it some sense of time.

221
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,760
It's the sense of time of this prepare measure cycle.

222
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,112
And that's implicit in M, right?

223
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:38,170
We've used the Wick rotation to get rid of what I'll end up calling the external time T, the objective time T.

224
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:51,420
And we'll see in July where this internal time comes from, in terms of the Wick rotation.

225
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,948
But we can say now that it's an agent-specific time.

226
00:32:58,114 --> 00:33:12,770
It's an internal time reference frame that's built into our idea of this system, Alice, that can act on the world. And it represents the time that's required to ask this question. Ok.

227
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,716
Can I ask a question at this point?

228
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:18,630
Yes.

229
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,260
So, on this slide with the operator M, I'm curious.

230
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:31,240
How can the agent deploy in the operator M tell the difference or break the symmetry between preparation and measurement?

231
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,000
Or are they just completely dual pictures?

232
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,572
Yeah, they're completely dual.

233
00:33:37,636 --> 00:33:41,720
So the agent never breaks the symmetry.

234
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,340
The agent can't actually distinguish the act of preparing from the act of measuring.

235
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,988
Every preparation is a measurement, and every measurement is a preparation.

236
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:53,890
Right.

237
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:06,310
That's, in fact, what this axiom of (unitarity) measuring a state leaves the particle in the measured state means.

238
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,510
Right.

239
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,180
So, yeah, mathematically, they're duals.

240
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,230
Thank you.

241
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:24,360
Okay, so let's now use this theory that we've developed to describe the interaction between Alice and Bob.

242
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:39,150
And, let's think of a situation in which Alice prepares a qubit that Bob then measures, and then Bob prepares the very same qubit, and then Alice measures it.

243
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:50,720
So, Alice acts with her Hamiltonian operator, which we'll label "Ha", and Bob acts with his Hamiltonian operator that we label "Hb".

244
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,030
And, let's say that Alice prepares the qubit as in state up.

245
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:04,870
And, Bob can then measure the qubit in state up and say: "Oh, the qubit is now up".

246
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:17,368
And, if Bob then prepares the qubit in state down, Alice can measure the qubit in state down and say: "Oh, the qubit switched from the up that I prepared to down".

247
00:35:17,454 --> 00:35:19,950
So, Bob must have prepared it as down.

248
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,590
So, what's happened here?

249
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,700
Alice and Bob have actually shared a bit flip.

250
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,650
Alice said "up" and Bob said "down", and Alice heard him say "down".

251
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,890
So, they've shared this idea of change by interacting with each other.

252
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,510
Now, this works as long as they mean the same thing by "up" and "down".

253
00:35:50,040 --> 00:36:00,730
So, we've implicitly assumed, in talking about them communicating, that they both have this reference frame that distinguishes "up" from "down".

254
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:10,876
And, this is actually a completely general model of what I'll call a noiseless 1-qubit channel.

255
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:12,636
Now, what does that mean?

256
00:36:12,818 --> 00:36:17,692
It's noiseless because there's nothing else in the picture, right?

257
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:23,112
There's nothing in the picture that can jiggle the qubit when Alice and Bob aren't looking.

258
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:30,604
Alice and Bob are the only systems we're talking about, and they share this qubit and there's nothing else in the picture.

259
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:42,944
So, there's no kind of third party or environment or heat bath or anything like that that's going to mess with the qubit and disrupt their interaction.

260
00:36:43,072 --> 00:36:55,210
So, that's a noiseless channel and it's a 1-qubit channel because they just have one qubit that they're interacting with and they're alternately preparing and measuring its state.

261
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:03,100
Now, clearly, if they can interact using 1-qubit, they can interact using any finite number of qubits.

262
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:16,240
So, here's a picture of an N-qubit channel that Alice and Bob, which here I've labeled A and B, (because I took this figure from a paper) are sharing.

263
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:25,330
And, Alice and Bob both have N operators, one for each of the N-qubits that they share.

264
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:30,192
And, they just do this prepared measurement cycle on all N-qubits.

265
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:44,180
So, you can think of Alice preparing the N-qubits, Bob measuring the N-qubits, and then Bob preparing and Alice measuring, and that allows them to exchange N-bit messages.

266
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,048
And, we can make N as large as we want.

267
00:37:47,214 --> 00:37:52,060
And so, they can exchange messages of arbitrary complexity.

268
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:01,580
And, if they share the meaning of "up" and "down", then they can exchange these messages with no noise, so they can communicate.

269
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:14,050
And, we now have our theory of two communicating agents that are sharing arbitrary finite information.

270
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:22,550
Now, I've labeled q1 through qN in this picture, a Holographic Screen.

271
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,150
And, in fact, that's exactly what it is.

272
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,000
Recall from Session 1 this slide illustrating the Holographic principle.

273
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,470
Shannon made this point that a bit of information is an answer to a yes-no question.

274
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,916
And so, we can write down a number of possible states.

275
00:38:48,018 --> 00:38:50,220
We can write down an entropy.

276
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:58,844
And, the limiting case of that entropy is the entropy of a black hole.

277
00:38:58,972 --> 00:39:09,300
The densest possible encoding of information in space or on a boundary.

278
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:20,040
And, this Holographic principle allows us to see any boundary, as we discussed in Session 1, as an encoding of bits.

279
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:28,010
So, the previous boundary of these in qubits, we can think of as a Holographic Screen.

280
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,310
Now, why is that important?

281
00:39:34,640 --> 00:40:02,608
It's important because it allows us to use this idea of holography and this idea of a fixed encoding of a message or a fixed encoding of an observable entropy at some density that was developed in Cosmology to talk about arbitrary quantum communication channels.

282
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:14,890
So, we can import a whole bunch of theory that was done someplace else into Quantum Information Theory and see that it works perfectly because it describes exactly the same situation.

283
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,410
Now, what does this tell us?

284
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:31,340
Philosophically, it tells us that Alice and Bob can learn about each other at most N bits per communication cycle.

285
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:43,250
So, the maximal amount of information that they can get from an observation is the N bits that the other one wrote on the screen.

286
00:40:45,240 --> 00:41:04,200
So, this tells us something very important, that when an agent is looking at their environment, which is this other agent, Bob, the amount of information that can be extracted from the environment is actually proportional to the size in bits of the boundary.

287
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,910
And, the Holographic principle just makes that size finite in space.

288
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:20,190
And, I said early on that there's no embedding spacetime in this theory, that Alice and Bob are not thought of as separated in space.

289
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:31,360
But as soon as we use the Holographic principle, we can think of the boundary between them as having a spatial coordinate, even though they don't have a spatial coordinate.

290
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:59,880
So, we'll get back to this point in September when we talk about theories of emergent spacetime, but all of these theories of emergent spacetime come back to this idea that boundaries can have spatial extent, even though the systems that they separate don't have any natural spatial description or natural spatial degrees of freedom.

291
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,270
Okay, so now let's recall another picture from Session 1.

292
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:37,370
We talked a little bit about Feynman's theory of scattering, the origin of Feynman diagrams, and the idea that if Alice prepares some system in some initial state and then measures the state later. If we want to calculate what the new state is, we have to take into account all of the possible paths that join the initial state that Alice prepared to the final state that Alice measured.

293
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,110
So, what does that mean?

294
00:42:52,560 --> 00:43:06,770
I mean, here effectively, if we think of... Suppose I'm Alice and the boundary is my screen. I'm talking to the screen, and then later on, I'm going to measure the screen.

295
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:15,510
And, between my preparation actions and my measurement actions, a bunch of stuff happens on the other side of the screen.

296
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:25,444
And, if I want to predict what's going to happen on the other side of the screen, I've got to take into account every possible thing that could happen.

297
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:33,656
And, I have to give some weight to those possible things that could happen.

298
00:43:33,758 --> 00:43:45,870
And, Quantum theory, in fact, tells you how to assign those weights to things that could happen, in order to make a measurement, given some theory of the mechanism that makes things happen.

299
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,370
But the fact that all of the paths have to be counted is what unitary evolution means.

300
00:43:53,060 --> 00:44:01,570
This evolution that preserves information that doesn't take any away, it doesn't add any, it just represents it in different ways.

301
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:14,470
So, if you look at this screen and imagine that Alice is interacting with her boundary and then she's interacting with her boundary again, it looks just like the previous screen.

302
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,800
And the wavy red arrows are what's happening inside Bob.

303
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:31,630
The wavy red arrows are a representation of what's going on inside Bob as he measures his side of the screen and then prepares his side of the screen.

304
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:44,370
So, what Feynman is representing here is just the action of the environment or the action of the system while Alice isn't looking.

305
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:53,040
Between Alice's preparation stage and her measurement stage, while Bob is doing his measurement and preparation.

306
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,832
So this diagram is actually completely symmetrical.

307
00:44:56,896 --> 00:45:04,896
We could have drawn an arrow where the wavy red things are and drawn wavy red things where we talked about Alice.

308
00:45:05,008 --> 00:45:08,410
And, we'd have the same picture just from Bob's point of view.

309
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:22,830
We can also think of this, of course, as Alice communicating with her future self by writing a memory record someplace in the world and then coming back and reading it.

310
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:39,650
And if Alice writes a memory in the world and then comes back later on and reads it, she actually has to take into account some theory of all of the things the world might have done to her memory while she wasn't looking.

311
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,660
So, this picture of Feynman's actually tells us a lot about memory.

312
00:45:47,400 --> 00:46:02,952
And, when we think about organisms running around in the world doing things like we do all the time, we tend to think of memories as things that are persistent and unchanging and all of that.

313
00:46:03,006 --> 00:46:04,890
But we know that that's not true.

314
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,730
We know that memories degrade in various ways.

315
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:21,340
We know that adversarial third parties can come and change what we've done so that they fool us into thinking that we've remembered something that we haven't.

316
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,600
And so on, and so forth.

317
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:36,740
That whole picture of memory is actually encoded in this picture that Feynman drew in the late 1950s to represent the scattering of particles.

318
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:47,030
So, what we've done here is started with this simple idea of asking questions.

319
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:52,164
And, we've actually constructed a fair amount of Quantum Theory.

320
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:56,628
We constructed the Schrodinger equation. We constructed the unitary propagator.

321
00:46:56,724 --> 00:47:04,700
We constructed the idea of a reference frame, which we'll talk about intensely next time in July.

322
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:12,370
So, we can sum this up by saying that Quantum theory simply is a theory of communicating agents.

323
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:34,704
And that quantum mechanics, the theory that Feynman was complaining about in that earlier slide, that quantum mechanics generates this problem that seems intractable of how to understand measurement because the theory is in fact about measurement.

324
00:47:34,832 --> 00:47:37,690
It's not about mechanical motion at all.

325
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:42,920
So, Quantum Theory actually tells us nothing about ontology.

326
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:55,912
And, this is why the interpretations of Quantum Theory, the many worlds interpretation, where you have all these branching universes and so forth, are not really science.

327
00:47:55,976 --> 00:47:57,112
They're philosophy.

328
00:47:57,176 --> 00:48:05,788
They're attempts to understand an ontology that's generated by a theory that doesn't talk about ontology.

329
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:08,850
It talks about communication between agents.

330
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,528
But we've left something very important out.

331
00:48:12,694 --> 00:48:20,070
We've left out a consideration of what happens when Alice and Bob don't mean the same thing by "up" and "down".

332
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:30,136
And, we've left out the famous phenomenon of entanglement - the spooky action at a distance, as Einstein called it.

333
00:48:30,238 --> 00:48:34,680
And, it turns out these things that we've left out are very, very closely related.

334
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,604
And, we're going to see why in July.

335
00:48:39,732 --> 00:48:42,604
But I'm going to give you a brief preview now.

336
00:48:42,802 --> 00:48:48,284
So, what happens when Alice and Bob actually mean different things by "up" and "down"?

337
00:48:48,482 --> 00:48:51,660
What if their reference frames aren't aligned?

338
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,680
Well, the first thing to note is that nothing in the theory says they have to be aligned.

339
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,490
So, we have to consider the possibility that they're not.

340
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:09,040
And, in fact, both Alice and Bob have to have what's called "free choice" of reference frame.

341
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:17,560
When Alice prepares her instrument, she has to be able to prepare it any way she wants to, in order to do an experiment.

342
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:31,710
And, when Bob makes up a sentence to tell Alice, he has to be able to choose any language he wants to use, he's a free agent in this way.

343
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,544
And, if they don't have that freedom, it turns out they're entangled.

344
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:41,900
So reference frame, nonalignment, and entanglement are very, very closely coupled.

345
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:51,120
Now, the misalignment of reference frames is what produces superpositions of outcomes.

346
00:49:51,940 --> 00:50:14,776
So, if Alice makes her measurements with her up-down arrow arranged vertically, for example, but Bob prepares his qubit with his up-down arrow arranged at 90 degrees to Alice's, Alice is not going to have any idea what Bob did.

347
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:18,820
I mean, she can't see distinctions in the left-right direction.

348
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,380
She can only see distinctions in the up-down direction.

349
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,580
So, all she can do is flip a coin.

350
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:36,608
If she wants to know what Bob prepared, it's 50% likely he prepared up for her what she calls 1.

351
00:50:36,774 --> 00:50:41,088
And it's 50% likely that he prepared what's down for her.

352
00:50:41,174 --> 00:50:42,370
She can't tell.

353
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:49,744
Now, if Bob's reference frame is pointing at about 45 degrees, so, up for him means 45 degrees off of Alice's up, then she can sort of tell what he did.

354
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:06,010
If he's pointing 45 degrees from up, then she's probably going to measure up.

355
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,230
And if he's pointing 45 degrees from down, she's probably going to measure down.

356
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:17,420
So, her outcomes are 75% for 1 and 25% for -1.

357
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:21,660
If he prepares at this 45-degree angle.

358
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,624
So, we can write this in a particular way.

359
00:51:24,662 --> 00:51:46,368
We can say that the value that Alice gets acting with her M on a qubit that Bob prepared is some number times what she measures as up plus some other number plus times what she measures as -1, where those numbers, the squares of those numbers, add to 1.

360
00:51:46,554 --> 00:51:48,344
So, why do they have to add to one?

361
00:51:48,462 --> 00:51:51,720
Well, they add to one because of the Pythagorean theorem.

362
00:51:54,300 --> 00:52:00,540
1 is the distance, the total distance between the two outcomes.

363
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:07,740
And A squared plus B squared are the other two sides of that triangle.

364
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:26,256
So, another way to think of it is that the metric distance in possibility space is 1 and A squared and B squared are just the Euclidean distance components.

365
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:29,936
Again, Euclidean distance is based on the Pythagorean theorem.

366
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:33,060
So, this is the Born rule in Quantum Theory.

367
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:42,490
It's the rule that tells us what happens when we're trying to measure a superposition and it tells us where these superpositions come from.

368
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:50,140
We have a mismatch in reference frames between two agents that are communicating.

369
00:52:52,480 --> 00:53:09,330
So, if we go back to the Free Energy Principle, which is what this whole active inference class is about, and we formulate it in Quantum Theory, we get a very simple idea of what the Free Energy Principle is.

370
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:21,910
The FEP and Quantum Theory just say that interacting systems are going to behave in a way that aligns their reference frames and that makes their communication as good as it can be.

371
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:37,160
But since aligning reference frames perfectly leads to entanglement, the Free Energy Principle drives systems asymptotically toward entanglement.

372
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:46,540
Well, the Principle of Unitarity says that all systems will approach entanglement asymptotically.

373
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,540
So, we can see the FEP is actually a classical statement of the Principle of Unitarity.

374
00:53:53,540 --> 00:54:09,860
And, what we'll see in the next Session is why this is the case, why active inference, when we think of it quantum mechanically, is a way of talking about the Principle of Unitarity, which is the deepest axiom of Quantum Theory.

375
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:25,320
And, we'll also see that this question of alignment becomes more and more complex as the complexity of the messages that the systems are trying to communicate to each other increases.

376
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:30,860
And that message complexity correlates with system complexity.

377
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:39,950
So that aligning complicated systems is very hard, although aligning very simple systems is fairly easy.

378
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:53,410
And, if you think about what's the simplest possible theory in science, it's particle physics, because you're dealing with these very simple things that interact in extremely simple ways.

379
00:54:54,120 --> 00:55:06,752
And, the really difficult parts of science are things like sociology, where you're dealing with incredibly complicated systems like humans that interact in incredibly complicated ways.

380
00:55:06,906 --> 00:55:12,250
And, all we have are very vague kinds of folk theories of how that works.

381
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:19,370
But we know from that example that aligning complex systems is extremely difficult.

382
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:24,030
So, humans don't get along very well.

383
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:34,610
So, the 2nd Session well, the 2nd discussion section which Andrew will be leading is on Saturday, the 1st of July, a couple of weeks from now.

384
00:55:35,540 --> 00:56:01,780
The 3rd lecture Session will be on July 13th and I hope you all will contribute to the interactive question and answer session on the web and show up for the discussion on Saturday, the 1st of July and join us again in July for the discussion of quantum reference frames and reference frame alignment.

385
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,530
So thank you very much.

386
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:10,470
Thank you, Chris.

387
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:12,790
All right.

388
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,070
Thank you all again.

389
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:22,002
Please check out the course syllabus, ask questions through the site, and see you at the discussion.

390
00:56:22,066 --> 00:56:23,414
See you next time.

391
00:56:23,612 --> 00:56:24,262
Thank you.

392
00:56:24,316 --> 00:56:24,666
Bye.
