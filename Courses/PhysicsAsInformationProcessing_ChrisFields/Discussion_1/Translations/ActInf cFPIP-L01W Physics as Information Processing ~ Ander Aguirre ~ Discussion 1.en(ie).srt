1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,039
hello and welcome everyone

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,519
it's June 3rd 2023 we're in the first

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,980
discussion section for physics as

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,839
information processing course with Chris

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,980
fields so welcome to all who are here on

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,859
and off camera really exciting to see so

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,619
many people joining for this

8
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:27,660
participatory discussion section so in

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,519
this first interval

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,140
we're going to

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,719
go to anyone who raises their hand and

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,579
it would be awesome to hear from

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,340
everyone who'd like to share

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,260
what excites them about what they heard

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,960
in the first lecture how has their

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,440
background and journey led to them

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,820
joining what are they hoping to learn

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,140
and do

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,480
in this course

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,760
so

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,640
first hand we'll get to go

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,039
maybe under you can actually start first

23
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,899
just speaking as a normal participant

24
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,939
and then meanwhile anyone is welcome to

25
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,619
raise their hands

26
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,619
that sounds good so I

27
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,220
I am a mathematician by training

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,560
um but I've always been interested in

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,080
the more physics side of things

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,659
and in particular you know I follow

31
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,759
Chris's work

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,060
I'll work pretty closely since probably

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,400
2019

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,460
uh and I don't know I'm just very

35
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,680
interested in the whole ontology of

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,079
quantum measurement what it means

37
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,960
um I feel like you know very often when

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,000
it's taught in physics classes it's hand

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,320
waved away

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,200
and even though I myself uh subscribe to

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,060
the philosophy of you know shut up and

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,200
compute

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,079
sometimes you know not everything you

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,579
need to do a little bit of philosophy

45
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,439
maybe and this may be one of the things

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,119
where you need to do it and you need to

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,220
address it from uh first principles

48
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,500
right and I think Chris is doing that so

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,159
I'm just here to learn more and yeah

50
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,680
that's basically it

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,720
awesome I'll just go from the top left

52
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,160
because I'm not necessarily watching

53
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,099
like what order but Ross first

54
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,020
yeah

55
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,280
hi

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,420
um

57
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,020
I'm interested in the kind of overlap

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,860
between cognitive science and physics

59
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,680
and seeing if uh there are any pan

60
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,459
psychist implications of the observation

61
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,440
that uh

62
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,260
physical processes seem to follow the

63
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,420
same kind of principle that we see apply

64
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,319
to uh brains and cognitive systems

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,239
awesome thank you Avo

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,340
hi I am uh I'm uh we have mixed

67
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,180
backgrounds

68
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,220
uh mostly physics and cognitive science

69
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,140
right now it could be qualified as a

70
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,000
philosopher of

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,819
visit some cognitive science and I'm

72
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,760
interested in uh basically formalizing

73
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,519
per respiratory realism the idea that

74
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,800
observer participates in creating

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
reality

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,519
I did some work in formalizing that in

77
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,280
the case of social norms and things like

78
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,360
language

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,019
and I met a block based on my lack of

80
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,060
knowledge of quantum physics and the

81
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,879
mathematical tools that I used for that

82
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,700
so I'm here in a course to get those

83
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,958
formal skills

84
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,340
awesome thank you evil blue

85
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,220
I think Alex was first

86
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,519
okay Alexi go for it oh sorry

87
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,560
hi I'm Alexia I'm a clinical

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,840
psychologist in Maryland in the states I

89
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,819
uh work with patients do Psychotherapy

90
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,299
mostly my interest came through uh Mark

91
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,879
songs uh who is uh you know the Creator

92
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,340
and leader of neuropsychoanalysis and he

93
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,620
has been collaborating with Kristen uh

94
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,019
on uh heart problem of Consciousness and

95
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,720
he's not working on AI with emotions and

96
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,199
so uh he you know I blame him I say it

97
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,180
with respect and love that for uh

98
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,978
introducing mathematics into our field

99
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,440
which was mostly devoid of mathematics

100
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,020
and uh people started looking at these

101
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,699
partial differential equations and

102
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,340
Markov blankets uh so I wrote a paper

103
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,280
about a possible extension of their

104
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,220
model uh to include chaos theory and I

105
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,080
just want to understand deeper uh

106
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,060
Concepts involved I have some

107
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,860
understanding of them but perhaps not

108
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,419
enough and I'm enjoying this course a

109
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,000
great deal I mean I think Chris among

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,680
other things is a fantastic teacher and

111
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,660
he is able to express things very

112
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,600
clearly and it just I have oh I have

113
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,220
Goosebumps so I'm very grateful to

114
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,759
everybody and thank you so much

115
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,600
cool blue then Francesco

116
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,540
hi everyone I'm blue Knight I'm with the

117
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,600
active inference Institute so I've been

118
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,940
tracking this work of Chris's

119
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,440
um you know connecting Quantum

120
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,440
information and active inference for I

121
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,820
don't know a couple couple years now

122
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,680
through through that thread

123
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,340
um I'm super interested actually in

124
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,680
um the aspect of

125
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,680
space-time arising from communication I

126
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,240
think that that's like fascinating to

127
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,720
dive into and how it connects to the

128
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,539
like Buddhist and maybe more Eastern

129
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,360
religion like concept of dependent

130
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,280
arising like how like the

131
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,919
interdependence of

132
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,919
all things leads to their existence

133
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,840
um and and so from from that aspect I

134
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,699
think that that's like the what I'm most

135
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,340
interested in exploring my background is

136
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,020
um Neuroscience but I've also been

137
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,419
studying practicing Buddhism for like 25

138
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:59,719
years so um yeah that's it thanks

139
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,060
awesome Francesca then Corby

140
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,280
thanks Daniel ciao everyone super happy

141
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,440
to be here I also have a mixed

142
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,240
background because I studied cognitive

143
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,039
anthropology and philosophy of science

144
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,039
and currently a few months ago I started

145
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,919
a PhD in artificial intelligence in an

146
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,100
es application in the educational field

147
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,620
and yes I'm actually super excited about

148
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,819
the all the science implications that

149
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,440
Chris Fields mentioned in the first

150
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,419
lecture in connection I have no

151
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:31,620
background in physics but the

152
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,720
connections between the first principles

153
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,060
of physics and free energy principle and

154
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,520
scientific condition in general is what

155
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,039
is really getting me exciting these days

156
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,759
thank you

157
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,039
cool Corby and then anyone else who

158
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,940
raises their hint

159
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,620
uh yeah great to be here uh my

160
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,259
background is in Quantum engineering uh

161
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,660
I've always been motivated by figuring

162
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,340
out what the next big thing in Computing

163
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,100
was in high school Moore's law was sort

164
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,900
of coming to an end and it seemed like a

165
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,580
really big opportunity to figure out

166
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,220
what the next day Computing architecture

167
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,860
might be so I did active research and no

168
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,220
more Computing on Computing and Quantum

169
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,680
sensors and I felt like I was a little

170
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,660
bit too early for all of those things so

171
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,620
I went into uh cloud and cloud gaming

172
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,280
and streaming AI services but I'm still

173
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,259
extremely motivated to figure out what

174
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,940
the next big thing is in the holographic

175
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,039
principle seems like a good foundation

176
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,240
to explore that

177
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,580
awesome

178
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,620
I'll raise my own hand than anyone else

179
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,039
is uh welcome to go so I'm Daniel

180
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,880
I'm a researcher at The Institute and

181
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,340
have known under for some years and

182
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,960
learns about all kinds of stochastic

183
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,300
matrices and how the math and the

184
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,419
quantum were linked and we had talked

185
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,860
and joked about

186
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,960
learning from Chris fields for a long

187
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,259
time so when the opportunity arose to

188
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,000
enact it

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,599
and extend it and open it we were very

190
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,099
excited

191
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,620
and also don't have much of a formal

192
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,139
background in physics outside of working

193
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,220
with Jacob and Ali on Livestream 49.

194
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,479
um

195
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,940
so it's just going to be a great

196
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,819
time to learn and see where it all goes

197
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,320
anyone else want to say uh hello in this

198
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,300
kind of opening section

199
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,480
okay well

200
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,820
continuing forward of course please just

201
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,800
feel free to raise your hand anytime

202
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
you'd like to

203
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,700
jump into the stack

204
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,399
under for for several minutes or however

205
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,339
you see could you

206
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,940
reflect on lecture one

207
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,440
where did Chris enter how did he proceed

208
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,519
and where did the lecture take us

209
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,519
um

210
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,180
thank you

211
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,519
yeah so can you zoom in a little bit

212
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,480
more on the PDF

213
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,899
can you hear me thank you good go for it

214
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,640
let's uh take a look at the slides from

215
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,580
last time so I think if if we were to

216
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,740
summarize this

217
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,140
um whole lecture

218
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,060
basically what Chris was trying to say

219
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,120
is that there are many hints coming from

220
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,220
different directions

221
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,740
pointing at the same thing right

222
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,839
pointing at the fact that you know

223
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,519
information

224
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,220
no will have a central aspect

225
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,880
uh in physics in the future but also

226
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,880
possibly biology right so

227
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,140
the earliest games came from

228
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,019
statistical mechanics if you wish

229
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,080
but also uh quantum mechanics right

230
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,300
again we need to make a like an

231
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,640
important but subtle distinction between

232
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,160
what it is the uncertainty principle

233
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,160
right because you know we think of that

234
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,019
as as the informational part right like

235
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,800
a limit on the resolution on information

236
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,440
uh and what is the observer effect just

237
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,080
to make that distinction clear I think

238
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,500
Chris is talking out the observer effect

239
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,140
the alternative principle is a an

240
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,320
artifact of the wave nature of you know

241
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,480
quantum mechanics right you can you can

242
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,399
get it from properties of the Fourier

243
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,080
transform with caution towards

244
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,120
inequality but at the end of the day

245
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,480
it's what I was saying earlier right

246
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,820
what is the basic picture of measurement

247
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,579
right and that's sort of increase with

248
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,560
Claysburg and Marciano is trying to

249
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,480
address

250
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,360
and the first two hints came from

251
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,480
from quantum mechanics around 1900 and

252
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,399
statistical mechanics a few decades

253
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,720
earlier

254
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,760
then there's you know

255
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,720
more stuff right like uh obviously

256
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,300
businesses uh resisted to inertia of

257
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,899
hundreds of years of a totally objective

258
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,279
you know

259
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,860
Observer independent universe but the

260
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,399
hints continue to pile on

261
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,320
um

262
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,079
some stuff coming from math but perhaps

263
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,360
the most interesting is is again you

264
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,779
know how all those paradoxes from

265
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,440
statistical mechanics were

266
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,519
were made sense of with Land hours

267
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,360
proposal

268
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,060
and then as physics got more fancy past

269
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,339
you know qftm stuff you know people

270
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,260
started thinking about

271
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,339
um

272
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,560
Quantum information more seriously so we

273
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,480
had Bell's theorem and all these

274
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,420
proportions by Deutsch and Wheeler and

275
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,500
so on

276
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,200
and I and I should say that uh uh this

277
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,800
is not a fringe idea in physics the

278
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,899
Paradigm of it from qubit is very much

279
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,720
mainstream I mean Google it a lot of

280
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,100
physicists

281
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,200
think about it you know I don't know how

282
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,760
many of them you know talk about it

283
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,980
openly but you know it's it's been a

284
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,260
widespread full contribution so to speak

285
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,959
that you know information will have this

286
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,120
sort of central role

287
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,079
and the last sort of hints pointing in

288
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,880
that direction of information having a

289
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,980
central log came on the one side from

290
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,140
high energy stuff and that's the

291
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,180
holographic principle is

292
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,839
it originally arose in the context of

293
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,820
black hole for Dynamics but then you

294
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,579
know it was extended to you

295
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,920
to you know what's called the abs-cft

296
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,019
correspondence and the very most recent

297
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,639
stuff was you know this place

298
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,639
on the one side from high energy staff

299
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,300
sorry I can't speak a little more loudly

300
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,760
it's all good continue honor

301
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,860
yeah I thought there was a question but

302
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,600
someone was just unmuted it's all good

303
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,959
okay uh yeah so so that's basically it

304
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,440
right so let's there's hints

305
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,899
from many directions and most recently

306
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,540
uh you know the work of Tristan and

307
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,760
Levin coming from biology all pointing

308
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,500
in the same direction right that there

309
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,500
we might have to make sense of some sort

310
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,399
of

311
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,800
potentially scale free

312
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,940
information processing uh Peridot for

313
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,579
for what it means to be an observer you

314
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,500
know sort of all of these things are

315
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,300
pointing in that direction and I think

316
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,399
Chris's work is is addressing that

317
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,860
head-on right as I said earlier you know

318
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,420
sometimes you know it's it's good to do

319
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,820
computations but sometimes you need to

320
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,800
take a step back and think more

321
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,180
philosophically about what you're doing

322
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,859
and what the bigger picture is

323
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,980
and then maybe after people talk a

324
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,560
little bit I can you know we can warm up

325
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,839
to the second lecture we can build our

326
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,060
windows that I have open here

327
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,740
um some of them are the papers that are

328
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,160
to come

329
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,620
yeah anyone please feel free to

330
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,540
um raise your hand on this Alexia than

331
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,079
anyone else

332
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,899
well I had one uh thought about this

333
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,880
thing you know when you mentioned uh

334
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,440
that there's various perspectives from

335
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,899
the same concept and I'm trying to be

336
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,760
cautious on the one hand I think again

337
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,760
this amazing Clarity and precision with

338
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,440
which Chris expressed

339
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,839
um uh thoughts is is fantastic and

340
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,000
enjoyable on the other hand it requires

341
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,220
simplification and generalization and

342
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,440
what I observe in my field is take

343
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,480
people take a term like entropy and run

344
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,519
with it and then they get very quickly

345
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,040
from thermodynamic entropy to Shannon to

346
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,899
you know whatever entropy and they talk

347
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,519
about sort of

348
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,560
um and that's not the case I mean if we

349
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,300
go back to class use and all the others

350
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,820
there was a system of postulates and

351
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,220
axioms that must be maintained and if

352
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,260
you step outside of that so like us

353
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,240
organisms we're open systems we're not

354
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,399
closed systems so we should not apply

355
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,100
directly second world thermodynamics and

356
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,380
you know I I deal a little more with

357
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,540
comographs and I entropy and which is

358
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,180
not the same thing and I guess when we

359
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,160
very quickly we move from sort of

360
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,100
thermodynamics to you know uh to

361
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,079
statistical mechanics with boltzmann to

362
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,820
you know all the way around and we

363
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,519
assume it is the same thing I think we

364
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,260
may need to be careful because we are

365
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,579
just ignoring the differences in

366
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,980
assumptions you know Shannon talked

367
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,079
about Telegraph he talked about a

368
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,300
receiver getting a message from a sender

369
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,060
right and clausius talked about you know

370
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,300
uh gas so

371
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,339
um but but I do think it's a balancing

372
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:51,959
act and there's no way to not have

373
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,880
simplification and generalization I just

374
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,740
wanted to say somewhere somehow we need

375
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,899
to kind of you know go back there and

376
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,600
just say you know uh entropy is not

377
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,820
entropy is not entropy and all these

378
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,220
things are kind of you know long papers

379
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,459
right

380
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,959
yes Jakob then Ali than anyone else

381
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,139
um

382
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,420
I um

383
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,760
I just wanted to uh

384
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,019
ask for I guess perhaps uh slightly

385
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,480
longer comment from Alexian

386
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,880
that what you see as the fundamental

387
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,980
differences

388
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,100
in different descriptions of entropy and

389
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,480
whether there is

390
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,040
some

391
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,779
I guess General concept that could be

392
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,360
extracted from all of them such as level

393
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,639
of information or uncertainty about a

394
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,940
particular system even though these

395
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,220
specific uh formulations of entropy they

396
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,199
talk about they were derived from

397
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,079
different specific systems and they

398
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,059
have different equations describing them

399
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,839
and they mean slightly different things

400
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,160
do um

401
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,959
do you think it would be wrong to say

402
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,000
that there is some commonality between

403
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,299
them

404
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,699
did I answer Daniel or yeah

405
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:28,260
I don't know I just think we need to at

406
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,540
some point formalize it and

407
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,100
um and be careful with his

408
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,799
generalizations for example uh when we

409
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,660
talk about active inference and friston

410
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,400
right you know when we say living

411
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,799
organisms must minimize I'm quoting for

412
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,940
instance by the way these are not my

413
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,460
thoughts the entropy of sensory States

414
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,640
right and then people take that idea

415
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,440
sometimes and generalize and they say

416
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,539
that that's what life is minimization of

417
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,179
entropy right but if you actually look

418
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,480
into human brain and measure entropy

419
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,340
then it goes all over the place up down

420
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,880
and in between uh and so I I don't think

421
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,919
that's an accurate description and the

422
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,600
reason for that is we're we shifted away

423
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,900
from the uh assumptions and uh again so

424
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,000
coma verse and I entropy talks about the

425
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,559
phase space and the Divergence of

426
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,299
trajectories in face space and sort of

427
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,700
the volume in face space while when you

428
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,160
talk about this for instance uh entropy

429
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,840
of sensory States these are probability

430
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,220
distributions

431
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,160
and Shannon talked about the uncertainty

432
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,679
of the receiver about the message sent

433
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,320
by the sender so if you want to extract

434
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,480
the same thing I suppose you can but but

435
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,580
it's important not to lose at least the

436
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,220
difference between what kind of object

437
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,840
are we applying to are we looking at

438
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,760
probability distributions are we looking

439
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,740
at Phase space are we looking at ideal

440
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,799
gas where are we at and we're just not

441
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,440
to say entropies entropies entropy

442
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,480
that's not the case I mean it's just a

443
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,299
formula but depending on the context

444
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,220
assumptions and and things it can be

445
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,640
very different

446
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,100
thanks Ali and other

447
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,400
uh yes in regard to Alex's comments I

448
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,860
just wanted to mention the research of

449
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,440
people like Rudolph panel and Stefan

450
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,039
Cerner because uh for many years they've

451
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,440
been exploring this idea of different

452
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,799
conceptions of entropy and they've come

453
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,039
up with at least a dozen different

454
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,260
meanings for entropy and they formulated

455
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,140
it in a kind of generalized framework

456
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,600
but at the same time they've also

457
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,820
devised uh

458
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,179
a way to somehow

459
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:44,640
classify them into equivalence classes

460
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,340
and to see whether one or more of those

461
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,200
conceptions of entropy can be

462
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,780
theoretically derived from uh from some

463
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,020
others or they're totally distinct and

464
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,160
different

465
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,760
um conceptions of entropy so yes I agree

466
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,000
that in some situations we need to be

467
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
more specific about what exactly we mean

468
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,360
by entropy and information uh

469
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,900
I mean based on the question or the

470
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,740
situation of Interest

471
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,400
thanks aval

472
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,100
so just to protein the entrepreneur

473
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,200
discussion I want to emphasize that

474
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,100
entrepates plnp so it's a functions

475
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,799
probability distribution which is uh I

476
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,660
think I'm not sure what the term is

477
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,179
English but it's a measure of how big

478
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,760
something is in a space

479
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,520
and to get that you have to define a

480
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,980
space and in many cases it's prohibitory

481
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,780
to decide what this place you're looking

482
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,720
at is for example you talk I don't know

483
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,940
if it was like say it was like say

484
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,620
someone talked about the

485
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,860
uh entropy of fmri

486
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,919
well those are aggregate measurements of

487
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,559
the relativity this is not the space of

488
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,380
all possible configuration and even if I

489
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,780
add something like the space of all but

490
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,820
to say functional configuration the

491
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,160
state in your own that reflect activity

492
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,840
this would be

493
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,380
another thing than the space of I don't

494
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,539
know Atomic configuration where the

495
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,780
specific atom are so

496
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,600
yeah you don't have a warranty that's

497
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,520
when you define entropy you define it on

498
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,400
a main full space that's not given

499
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,460
so let's

500
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,460
I kind of think there is one entropy and

501
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,200
that's it and need some info constructs

502
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,919
but also we have to if we agree to that

503
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,960
then we can tell that we have to find it

504
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,780
it's not just given out there in the

505
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,080
data

506
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,820
well certainly being precise in the

507
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,460
formalism and in natural language for

508
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,740
what we mean by information and entropy

509
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,000
and all these terms

510
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,460
is pretty important I mean the course

511
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,140
we're in is physics as information

512
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,000
processing

513
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,419
but without an understanding of how

514
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:28,020
information is being meant here

515
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,299
or what measurements and Transformations

516
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,960
were were performing what informational

517
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,820
operations then

518
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,500
it it

519
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,340
um

520
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,080
is it

521
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,059
a non-sequitur

522
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:46,340
so how do we how do we go about

523
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,360
um clarifying

524
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,159
or understanding what kinds of

525
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,100
theoretical results in a given domain or

526
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,280
like what is shown on the timeline here

527
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,620
might apply to some other area

528
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,159
Just one thought

529
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:08,460
anyone else can raise their hands with

530
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,539
uh

531
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,640
a thought or a question

532
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,419
otherwise honored you can um maybe

533
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,320
flip over to to select a few of the

534
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,158
submitted questions

535
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,159
cool could you zoom in

536
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,140
um with control plus a fair amount

537
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,460
thanks so everyone

538
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,500
um we really appreciate the submitted

539
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,659
questions we've been able to get 13

540
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:42,840
answered by Chris so far

541
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,220
and

542
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,020
um as with the transcripts of the

543
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,400
discussions and lectures the questions

544
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,860
and answers are going to be part of what

545
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,679
is published by the octave Journal so we

546
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,240
really encourage

547
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,840
basic questions Advanced questions just

548
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,960
there's no question that doesn't make

549
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
sense to submit

550
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,960
so under maybe just pick one question

551
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,700
that you think's interesting to begin

552
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,100
with and summarize uh Chris's response

553
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,539
and then everyone else is welcome to

554
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,780
kind of add some other thoughts on this

555
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,919
no

556
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,480
so I'm going to scroll up and down just

557
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,120
to sort of sample uh let me start with

558
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,120
the first two can you hear me well yep

559
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,700
uh since perhaps I think you submitted

560
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,860
this as a trial right is that is that

561
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,240
right yeah

562
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,120
so what is information about this time

563
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,840
um

564
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,880
here's Chris's response I guess everyone

565
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,640
has a chance to look at it now the one

566
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,980
if I am to summarize this the one thing

567
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,080
I've heard that you know personally the

568
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,299
one I like the most

569
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,539
um the answer at least as an adage to

570
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,240
summarize it is that information

571
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,740
um are differences that make a

572
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,240
difference this I might have heard from

573
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,320
Chris I might have heard from someone

574
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,880
else I don't remember

575
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,860
but that's one thing

576
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,860
now on to the question of what is time

577
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,580
and I guess this also addresses uh

578
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,659
Alex's question of what is entropy I

579
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,380
so I'll make a bigger point now uh what

580
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,080
is time this is partially addressed and

581
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,460
I guess the main thing I'll be doing

582
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,740
here is rather than the back look

583
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,419
forward into

584
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,760
what's to come in the course in

585
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,960
particular I'm thinking about

586
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,960
um

587
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,559
you know this these two papers uh and in

588
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,918
particular

589
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,260
particular and I finally chat with with

590
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,419
Chris about this uh this picture over

591
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,360
here okay more

592
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,039
yeah

593
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,900
I'll get back to you in a bit but

594
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,900
basically this this sort of like kills

595
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,120
two birds with a stone right this

596
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,980
picture and especially the text around

597
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,600
it and the title of this paper is the

598
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,860
physical meaning of the holographic

599
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,960
principle okay you guys can see here

600
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,500
archive 2020

601
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,020
2210 anyways

602
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,220
this addresses the notion of you know

603
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,919
the time on entropy because the the

604
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,480
point that's the claim that's made in

605
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,740
this paper is that these are local

606
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,559
Observer relative definitions and we can

607
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,120
uh

608
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,880
look into more detail around it but

609
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,900
basically the coordinate ta time is an

610
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,279
entropic

611
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,299
measure so it is

612
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,400
non-decreasing and it goes up with The

613
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,880
Observer measuring uh entropy in the

614
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,140
system

615
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,520
because of the symmetry of the

616
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,740
definition the second law applies to

617
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,240
both so both of server and environment C

618
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,220
entropy increasing

619
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,860
in their environment and vice versa

620
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,860
anyways

621
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,900
from from this picture one gets that you

622
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,539
have this internal Circle time qrf so

623
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,059
this just is is a necessary artifact of

624
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,100
recording information into a memory

625
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,600
that's that's the claim made in the

626
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,500
paper

627
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,840
and that essentially induces the

628
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,880
passenger of time at least from the

629
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,900
perspective of the Observer

630
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,600
um it also I think Alexi was talking

631
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,120
about which I totally uh understand and

632
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,220
agree with different Notions of of

633
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,500
entropy now

634
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,679
I suppose as the the you know

635
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,260
I I would be the one to to like

636
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,600
definitions and so on

637
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,700
um but I but I do think it's it's it's

638
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,799
good to to have a certain amount of

639
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,539
flexibility

640
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:40,799
um so

641
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,740
I see the same as energy right like

642
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,299
there are different kinds of energy you

643
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,039
know there's energy mass equivalences

644
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:47,820
and

645
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,159
you know if you push it into Super

646
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,840
symmetry you can think of it as

647
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,059
equivalent as Force also

648
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,220
but I I do think there is some value in

649
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,559
being sloppy or intuitive about about

650
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,419
the notion so so the fact that you know

651
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,340
entropy yes there are different

652
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,320
definitions I I don't I don't see it

653
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,820
quite as a problem you know one can

654
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,600
explore here around this this page

655
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,900
there is a definition of you know local

656
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,140
entropic time and

657
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,900
yeah one can think of it as you know

658
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,000
face space or what can think of it as

659
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,559
you know coding Fury but it is at the

660
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,880
end of the day I do think it is true

661
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,740
that both of them are hinting at the

662
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,799
same direction just like you know you

663
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,659
may have different kinds of energy

664
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,039
but

665
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,720
um you know they're not unrelated

666
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,419
Concepts and and yeah I hope one day we

667
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:40,919
get very precise definitions about

668
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,659
everything but but for now I think it's

669
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,679
good to speculate

670
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,440
okay there's a question yeah Corby and

671
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,960
then anyone else on this

672
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,640
yeah quick question so I haven't read

673
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,700
that specific paper but is there any

674
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,900
work on

675
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,240
the frequency or the rate at which one

676
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,400
could read and write information on the

677
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,600
boundary

678
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,600
yes well I I don't I don't I can't think

679
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
of the the paper exactly but this is

680
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,220
lower bounded I think Chris talked about

681
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,059
it

682
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,100
if not in the last lecture I I think

683
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,559
I've seen a talk of him on YouTube it's

684
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,059
lower bounded by the uncertainty

685
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,620
principle right

686
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,520
um so so for instance uh plants Planck's

687
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,380
constant is in

688
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,779
units of action which is energy times

689
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,840
time right so Leonard's principle says

690
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,059
you need a certain amount of energy you

691
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,279
know to erase information

692
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,080
and

693
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,520
and you have time right and then you

694
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,020
have an energy time uncertainty

695
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,100
principle

696
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,799
putting those things together right you

697
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,440
have any minimum amount of action which

698
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,919
is you know literally the minimum uh the

699
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,539
action is measuring what I said earlier

700
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,640
right like differences that make a

701
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,380
difference the minimal difference that

702
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,299
you can make so the minimum difference

703
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,520
to

704
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,880
you know you raise a bit or rewrite it

705
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,860
on the boundary so to speak right

706
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,840
uh so yeah that would be given by the

707
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,720
uncertain relation energy times time I I

708
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,399
don't know exactly the figure is but

709
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,020
it's obviously very small compared to

710
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,600
Everyday Life

711
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,700
got it and with is there work on the

712
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,679
upper bound like for example would it be

713
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,720
the number of degrees of freedom on the

714
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,620
boundary

715
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,020
no I don't think it's bonded from above

716
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,440
but but obviously you know then

717
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,600
we do want to buy it from above for

718
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,880
technological reasons if you wish but I

719
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,700
I think that is a an engineering problem

720
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,580
not not one of you know physics

721
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,380
um under a few few questions on this

722
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,120
figure

723
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,140
um

724
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,080
what are y and e

725
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,919
B the blue oval as Chris has pointed out

726
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,760
is going to consistently be the screen

727
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,159
the blanket and so we often associate

728
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,059
that with uh at least some blankets

729
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,880
include these information gathering

730
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,179
utilizing systems so what is happening

731
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:14,820
internal to the agent here what kind of

732
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,279
computation is happening and is this

733
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,340
something that is actually proposed to

734
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,080
be occurring

735
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,899
or is this a schematic or a map of how

736
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:28,639
we could think about something occurring

737
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,600
so

738
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,000
I think this question is going to be

739
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,260
better addressed by Chris himself

740
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,840
probably in the next lecture

741
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,440
um for now what I can say is I can

742
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,640
reiterate what I was trying to say

743
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,279
earlier which is that with these

744
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,440
addresses and you know these basic

745
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,799
measurement pictures so to speak is the

746
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,960
observer effect right like this notion

747
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,299
that you cannot observe something we

748
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:55,559
thought

749
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:59,520
without disturbing the environment so if

750
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,100
you then try to make sense of this by

751
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,779
constraining

752
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:06,179
you know from first principles Land

753
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:09,299
hours principle and so on uh basic

754
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:10,980
requirements on information processing

755
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,440
from the point of view of energy

756
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,919
then you get that this boundary

757
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,799
is constrained in some ways right this Y

758
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,600
is What's called the memory sector

759
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,880
meaning that

760
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,299
you don't just act on on the immediate

761
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,100
information that you perceive you may

762
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,100
also act on you know start the story

763
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,039
that you have perceived before

764
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,440
and then sure e the red part is what

765
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,640
you're perceiving right now the

766
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,039
environment uh but actually I don't know

767
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,100
if I have it in here

768
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,679
uh but this is further broken up into

769
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,980
other parts so not schematically here

770
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,299
let me try to find it over here

771
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,820
no I don't know actually bear with me

772
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,500
for a second I think you might be here

773
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,539
that's the same picture

774
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,260
anyways I I'm not I don't want to waste

775
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,480
time by trying to find it but

776
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,700
back to the original picture

777
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,580
yeah sure you use what you're measuring

778
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,200
and again Chris we'll talk about this in

779
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,039
more detail yeah but from first

780
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,019
principle assumptions

781
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,539
they deduce that you're gonna have to

782
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,779
you know deploy your finite resources

783
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,299
for gathering information in clever ways

784
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:46,860
on the boundary right so you're going to

785
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,840
have to deploy some resources for memory

786
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,100
some resources uh as a free energy uh as

787
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,200
a heat sink right so you're going to be

788
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,519
processing information so you're going

789
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,799
to be dumping you know so-called low

790
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,779
quality stuff into the environment

791
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,519
you're going to be dumping Heat

792
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,440
and then

793
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,179
other than the memory you're going to be

794
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:08,940
focusing on what's going on right now

795
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,580
in this environment and what I wanted to

796
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,320
say is that it can be further broken up

797
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,520
into what's called pointer and reference

798
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,219
sectors so you can imagine this

799
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,260
sector here it has to be broken into

800
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,379
further sectors because then there's the

801
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:27,480
other first principle notion okay so

802
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,179
what does it mean to observe something

803
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,980
the difference is that make a difference

804
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,099
right so you can only there's only

805
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,859
information with context right there is

806
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,139
no information per se it's all semantics

807
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,780
right so you've only observe things in

808
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,739
context

809
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,418
so some things are going to have to stay

810
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,440
the same

811
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,359
namely you know

812
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:50,639
reference States here and some things

813
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,260
are going to Bear right so you can think

814
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,940
of this as the gauge in your car right

815
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,060
obviously the circle stays the same

816
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,980
right and that's your context so to

817
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,260
speak that's the with the you know

818
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,300
numbers in it they never go away they're

819
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,640
staying the same but as you speed up

820
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,859
around the gauge is going to change and

821
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,540
that's how you know only in that context

822
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,460
you can tell you're on speed when you're

823
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,960
driving a car

824
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,280
right

825
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,680
so anyways this is just a teaser for

826
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,660
things to come

827
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,640
you can go back to more questions then

828
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,220
what do you think I'll pick maybe two or

829
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,939
three more over here

830
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,500
yeah pick another question or anyone

831
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,240
raising their hand or if anyone in the

832
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,740
live chat wants to write something I'll

833
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,020
read it

834
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,240
how about the wick rotation could you

835
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,820
summarize what the wick rotation is and

836
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,880
then State this question about it

837
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,460
so yeah that's a great question I I knew

838
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,839
the answer but I wish I knew the answer

839
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,960
better but and formally speaking

840
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,079
um the weak rotation is just so it's

841
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,780
Chris said you know you take a quantity

842
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,640
you multiply by I

843
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,220
square root of negative one that amounts

844
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,619
to a 90 degree rotation in a complex

845
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,560
plane fine now that appears to be a

846
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,520
trick

847
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,520
and what it does effectively is take you

848
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,099
from quantum mechanics to

849
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:14,640
physical mechanics roughly speaking

850
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,020
uh now why it works that's

851
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,359
probably I mean I have no clue I don't

852
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,880
know the answer myself but now

853
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,800
when things appear to be a trick and

854
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,660
they get you something maybe there's

855
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,800
more to it than than what's you know

856
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,280
Apparent at first uh but I myself don't

857
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,740
know the answer that's a very good

858
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,599
question

859
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,240
uh but I I do think you may have to do

860
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,078
with the fact that

861
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,880
on the one hand Quantum and statistical

862
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,520
mechanics both are

863
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,200
talking about

864
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,880
um

865
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,920
constraints on information processing

866
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,900
maybe from different perspectives but

867
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,760
again that's just the speculation on my

868
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,160
end I I don't so it's maybe a way of

869
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,680
relating the two

870
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,280
did we just review just read Chris's

871
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,520
full answer to this read the question

872
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,700
and then Chris's full answer

873
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,540
foreign

874
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,540
space

875
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,880
um

876
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,500
and then I'll I'll just read Chris's

877
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,119
answer then anyone please raise your

878
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,020
hand if you want to like add something

879
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,359
more on this you're out in a sense yes

880
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,220
time is perpendicular to our three

881
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,980
dimensions of space matter and energy we

882
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,440
ourselves exist in time Wick is pointing

883
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,119
to the intimate relationship between how

884
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,980
we measure time and how we determine or

885
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,960
judge that something maintains its

886
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,000
identity Through Time IE stays the same

887
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,640
thing through time to tell time by a

888
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,980
clock I have to be sure I'm looking at

889
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,440
the same clock set the same way

890
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,140
Etc we'll get to this in July and August

891
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,420
could you connect this Andre to some of

892
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,060
the um

893
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,579
semantic information flows

894
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:18,599
discussed in live stream 17 or any of

895
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:22,440
the other uh cone cocone diagrams from

896
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,560
the papers that you showed earlier

897
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,680
uh sure again I have to preface it by

898
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,000
saying that

899
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,359
I am working on understanding it myself

900
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,078
but

901
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,380
um just from you know small

902
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,420
Email exchange that I had with Chris

903
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,960
amps website in this paper

904
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,180
one can sort of see that it's related to

905
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,280
the picture I was showing earlier namely

906
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,560
this one right but let's scroll down a

907
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,339
little bit to page

908
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,820
to page 23 24 here they took out the

909
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,660
quotation again

910
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,940
um

911
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,299
so

912
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,099
I think it has it has to do with uh at

913
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,140
least from what I heard from crazy guy

914
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,900
email has to do this notion of local

915
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,119
local time

916
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,720
the definition of local time in this

917
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,980
observation picture

918
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,760
and you know the fact that you know

919
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,280
rotate 90 degrees

920
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,980
twice you get

921
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,060
the opposite sign basically right so

922
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,579
uh the local time it effectively that's

923
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:40,140
going to ensure that that the picture is

924
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,560
symmetric and that you know

925
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,720
the flow is going to be opposite in in

926
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,079
the direction uh towards the The

927
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,579
Observer and towards the environment

928
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,500
okay Alexi then anyone else raising

929
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,760
their hands

930
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,940
I I am struggling to understand and part

931
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,980
of my difficulty bear with me ever being

932
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,680
so uh kind of but I remember Sean

933
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,140
Carroll's uh lecture on time in

934
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,820
different versions of physics and it

935
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,619
took a whole hour so are we talking

936
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,960
Newtonian time which is universally the

937
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,540
same I would talk in relative time uh

938
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,280
you know philosophically are we talking

939
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,780
about people who believe that only

940
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,599
present here and now is real while

941
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,540
future and past do not exist you know so

942
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,900
when we say time is perpendicular to my

943
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,579
my sense is that just like Chris

944
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,440
mentioned and what you were Reinventing

945
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,359
the time we're creating a new definition

946
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,820
by calling it the same word we're all

947
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,260
familiar with that creates some

948
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,200
dissonance where I I I just think that

949
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,540
maybe we need to kind of say that this

950
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,740
is something new

951
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,900
and if it's not something new then which

952
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,460
version of the time are we talking about

953
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,680
einsteinian Newtonian or whatever you

954
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,140
know it's a simple question if we before

955
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,240
we say it's perpendicular do people

956
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,900
agree that future is uh real or not you

957
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,980
know foreign

958
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:10,440
again speculation

959
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,740
um neither here nor then

960
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,460
if we take Chris seriously that

961
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,240
communication is an ontological primary

962
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,859
and that rather than

963
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:26,099
putting Communications protocols in some

964
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,480
sort of time

965
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,640
Newtonian time Einstein time these are

966
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,560
these different time Concepts

967
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,660
these different scaffolds that then

968
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,300
communication gets inscribed within or

969
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,660
stretched within but if we start with a

970
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,880
topological understanding of

971
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,460
communication rather than a geometric

972
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,040
understanding of space-time so the

973
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,500
topology of the blanket and the observer

974
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,900
in their sensorium

975
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,740
then different kinds of cognitive agents

976
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,079
ranging from what we would call

977
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,040
non-living to what we could call living

978
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,660
they depending on their cognitive

979
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,720
sophistication are able to create or

980
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,680
project different time Concepts

981
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,859
time Concepts that are not useful will

982
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:15,839
lead to their own material dissolution

983
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,880
the failure to maintain that kind of

984
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,119
cognitive sophistication which requires

985
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,160
um not just information gathering

986
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,200
utilization but also energy Gathering

987
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,300
and utilization

988
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,320
and so when you have multiple agents who

989
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,540
are um whether you conceptualize them as

990
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,700
within a message passing relationship

991
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,500
and having uh no surprise on the clock

992
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,760
on the wall

993
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,099
then they're like in a local time

994
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:46,260
synchrony

995
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:53,240
but the primary case is one entity

996
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,060
engaging with its sensorium and its

997
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,280
self-modeling time

998
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,020
in terms of progression

999
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,700
and so these previous time Concepts and

1000
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,079
these different attempts to kind of

1001
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:11,540
survey the structure of space-time

1002
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,380
reflect different cognitive models

1003
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,380
that cognitive agents have proposed

1004
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,280
for time

1005
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,359
and that communication actually like

1006
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:27,240
takes ontological Primacy over all of

1007
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,280
these ramified

1008
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,859
um potentially overlapping potentially

1009
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,720
non-overlapping time Concepts

1010
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,760
but their Downstream of Agents cognitive

1011
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,800
models

1012
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,440
not vice versa

1013
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,839
I'm not sure it's how I interpreted what

1014
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,520
Chris said about communication being an

1015
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,780
ontological primary though

1016
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,500
so if we take one instance of a covid-19

1017
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,960
virus a single kind of instance right

1018
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,359
it's got no memory and no ability to

1019
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:01,200
plan

1020
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,260
is there a local time for that virus

1021
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,960
versus you know Humanity observing how

1022
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,000
the virus spreads across the globe and

1023
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,040
you know we have agents with memory and

1024
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,800
planning you know so

1025
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,440
is there a time relative to a single

1026
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,260
Photon you know I I just I mean it's

1027
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,480
it's my hunch is that there's a

1028
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,280
possibility that we're simply inventing

1029
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,720
something brand new and defining it

1030
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,640
brand new and I just they draw in

1031
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,200
parallel back to all these other times

1032
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,880
you know I understand the effort but

1033
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,220
it's it's just

1034
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,119
um

1035
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,000
is it is that a brand new time is it

1036
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,660
some other kind of time I don't know

1037
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,160
Daniel can I see it

1038
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,180
so I I understand Alex's question uh and

1039
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,339
I think it's sort of related to at least

1040
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:49,440
morally speaking to your concern about

1041
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,280
different kinds of entropy right

1042
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,280
um and what I can say is that also we

1043
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,140
have

1044
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,880
glazebrook Marciano and so on they have

1045
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,960
this

1046
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,500
um

1047
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:07,020
recent paper on Quantum error correction

1048
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,319
uh so uh I have yet to read it and take

1049
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,540
a closer look but here they talk about

1050
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,760
space time right

1051
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,000
and my punch

1052
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,720
to address Alex's question is that if

1053
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,540
you could sort of recover the more

1054
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,819
familiar Notions of time

1055
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:28,980
in a correspondence principle sort of

1056
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,800
way you know by taking some you know

1057
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,540
Newtonian limit or H bar goes to zero or

1058
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,599
speed of light was infinity and so on uh

1059
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,040
that would be very satisfactory sure

1060
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,200
they may be doing a new thing

1061
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,900
but you know recording all stuff and

1062
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,760
then you think it's a good sanity check

1063
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,940
and so long as we can see that being

1064
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,560
worked out I think I'd be very happy

1065
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,319
and just to the virus point I would

1066
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,359
argue that viruses through their

1067
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,400
physical engagement they do have memory

1068
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,859
but they don't necessarily have the

1069
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,300
awareness

1070
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,859
or a metacognition on that memory

1071
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:10,579
except as granted by intergenerational

1072
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:13,079
evolutionary type pressure

1073
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:15,980
but they do have past events

1074
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,800
modifying them within some

1075
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,460
set of possibilities

1076
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,960
so

1077
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,560
they're just being them

1078
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,800
and their internal time is is on

1079
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,020
there isn't a cognitive Observer

1080
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,020
necessarily

1081
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,380
in terms of like a narrative I

1082
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,380
I am watching the clock

1083
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,940
but they do change

1084
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,740
but it's certainly very provocative if

1085
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,720
this is not to or we could also look to

1086
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,060
Kronos and Kairos

1087
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,460
and about the the relationship of time

1088
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,300
and timeliness and agentic time

1089
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,520
so I think there's and then at this

1090
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,260
point are we stretching just this one

1091
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,619
four-letter word too far

1092
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,480
just like we brought up with information

1093
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,000
entropy

1094
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,859
I mean can we think about these as kind

1095
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:18,780
of like continents

1096
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,359
and then just if someone said I visited

1097
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,339
this continent you know that you need to

1098
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:24,900
specify a lot more

1099
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,460
or what

1100
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,160
granularity are these topics Corby and

1101
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,598
then anyone else raising their hands

1102
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,220
yeah on this topic

1103
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,859
for a Markov blanket you have a

1104
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:40,440
transition Matrix my question is how do

1105
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,720
you how are you allowed to increment

1106
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,420
that transition Matrix to calculate a

1107
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,640
future State like what does that mean in

1108
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,240
terms of time uh are you only allowed to

1109
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,740
increment it by like the lower bound

1110
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,380
time which is H over

1111
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,380
KBT

1112
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,880
does that question make sense

1113
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,099
I'll give a first pass on this we have

1114
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,500
discrete time and continuous time models

1115
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,000
in active inference

1116
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,859
for a discrete time model where you have

1117
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:13,319
the B transition Matrix

1118
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:16,740
then the choice of delta T is a

1119
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,720
modeler's decision and we talked about

1120
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,880
this a lot in live stream 52 on

1121
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,099
accelerated optimization there's some

1122
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:25,740
delta T that's like going to get you the

1123
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,480
most accelerated optimization if you

1124
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,180
have too small of delta T then you're

1125
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,700
either oversampling or you're maybe even

1126
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,560
physically unrealistic like you pointed

1127
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,480
to or if you have some long delta T

1128
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,099
you're also not making an informative

1129
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:39,359
simulation

1130
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,220
in the discrete time case where you're

1131
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,920
explicitly making time steps contrast

1132
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,500
with the continuous time generative

1133
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,079
model where we're doing more of a Taylor

1134
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:51,720
series expansion on the generalized

1135
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,240
coordinates at which point delta T is

1136
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,460
not required you're merely just taking

1137
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,220
an extended approximation from a given

1138
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,680
snapshot and so delta T doesn't even

1139
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,399
come into play

1140
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,700
got it okay that makes sense

1141
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,220
I don't know how it ties into time but

1142
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,660
it helps clarify a little bit

1143
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:19,319
okay anyone else can raise their hand or

1144
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:24,599
under kind of maybe one more question or

1145
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,339
one more topic from a paper just what's

1146
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,260
one more puzzle piece

1147
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,599
that you think

1148
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:33,900
gives us a first coat of paints

1149
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,280
from

1150
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,260
questions submitted or from one of these

1151
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,140
papers that you have up

1152
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,359
what's something that that helps us

1153
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,500
connect the dots a little bit

1154
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,760
uh so I don't I don't think I have a

1155
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,740
good answer let me look at the questions

1156
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,940
again

1157
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,720
uh

1158
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:57,540
but regarding time I'll just reiterate

1159
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,359
uh what I said I say record these

1160
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:03,960
questions which is that I I believe

1161
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,880
Chris will address it

1162
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,880
in in this bit I I don't know if you can

1163
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,680
see what I'm sharing on the screen but

1164
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,480
the paper will start all these

1165
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,460
communication protocols blah blah blah

1166
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,980
from March of this year

1167
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,619
uh does talk about space time

1168
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:22,680
it's a Quantum uh error correction code

1169
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,619
yeah and to me personally it'd be nice

1170
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:28,200
to see if that can be if more familiar

1171
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,119
Notions of time such as

1172
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:32,760
special relativity can be recovered as

1173
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,720
limits in correspondence principles

1174
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,839
um

1175
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,040
yeah do you want me to say anything else

1176
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,720
if anyone could even just summarize like

1177
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,400
what what would these what are these

1178
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,200
codes referring to

1179
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,480
or how are are these codes one and the

1180
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,380
same as communication protocols

1181
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,540
or are they related to the blanket and

1182
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,660
the the heat that was being output as

1183
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,200
waste

1184
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,420
What will what will these codes allow us

1185
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,099
to do better if we understood them more

1186
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:16,319
I don't know that I can answer that

1187
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,500
right now I don't I don't think they

1188
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,540
understand the question

1189
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,720
um yeah I I just don't know

1190
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,720
sorry

1191
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,380
Terry and then anyone else raising their

1192
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,680
hands

1193
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,720
um I I'm not a physicist I don't

1194
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,200
understand maths at all

1195
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:48,059
M but what attracted me to this um idea

1196
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,880
of physics is information processing is

1197
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,440
that

1198
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,540
um

1199
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:58,680
it feels like at a base level

1200
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,520
the whatever the X on Noble external

1201
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:07,200
status it could be perceived as

1202
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,559
made up of information you know we we

1203
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,140
kind of think of ourselves living in a

1204
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,619
particular universe but you know at a

1205
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:19,740
base level there are these and stop me

1206
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,619
if I'm just talking 14 year old nonsense

1207
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:25,140
here but you know that there's this

1208
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,180
notion of quantum Fields they feel like

1209
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,359
informational fields

1210
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,960
and

1211
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,800
um

1212
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,480
that

1213
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,140
the the the concept of of physics is

1214
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,839
purely information

1215
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:42,420
that we then interpret

1216
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,500
as a physical Universe which we inhabit

1217
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,800
because we can't see beyond our Markov

1218
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,140
blanket

1219
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,000
um

1220
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,059
I find this a really exciting

1221
00:52:57,059 --> 00:52:59,280
idea that

1222
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,579
as a that whenever you start to think of

1223
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,420
the um surprisal as the

1224
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,420
um variational free energy between you

1225
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,460
know sort of your your prior and your

1226
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,980
posterior if you start to think of that

1227
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:16,200
variational free energy not as energy

1228
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,839
but as an information Gap so that if you

1229
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:21,960
see the energy as actual you know

1230
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,400
because energy when you think of energy

1231
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,920
in physics terms it's kind of this

1232
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,040
magical thing that does that allows work

1233
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,800
to happen or you know but but what is it

1234
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,260
you know we've got a a term for it and

1235
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,300
we've got we've got we've got a you know

1236
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,960
we there's a jewels you know or whatever

1237
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,640
you know but but what does it mean it

1238
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,500
has this magical property but if you

1239
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,319
think of it as an information

1240
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,540
um then it starts to make sense so

1241
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,180
variational free energy starts to be

1242
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:54,000
seen as a difference in information

1243
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,040
between what you uh your your prior and

1244
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,058
your exterior

1245
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,900
so whenever you start to think about

1246
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,280
time time is this conceptual metric that

1247
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,660
we use

1248
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,640
almost because we have memory and

1249
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,640
um I I wonder if we are getting uh

1250
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,660
trapped in this semantics and all I have

1251
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,160
is English because I don't understand

1252
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:28,200
the maths really but um we we you know

1253
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,119
you guys come in here and you do

1254
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:31,559
understand the maths and then you

1255
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,559
convert it into English which I think I

1256
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,720
understand and then I can think of it

1257
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,140
like a kid in a sweaty shop or a physics

1258
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:44,299
class at the 14 years of age

1259
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:46,260
I don't really know what I'm saying I

1260
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,599
don't know what I'm saying but at a

1261
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,760
fundamental level everything that we're

1262
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,940
talking about is in for I I I can

1263
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,059
understand it as information and I'm

1264
00:54:57,059 --> 00:54:59,880
excited to see how things develop what

1265
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,980
are your thoughts on this craziness

1266
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,960
so many uh great pieces in there

1267
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,740
physics as information processing

1268
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,780
what is it that actually allows the

1269
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,700
steam engine to run and

1270
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,339
the ball to move

1271
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:22,559
that kind of physics

1272
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,640
and then as the timeline laid out also

1273
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,740
occurring during a period of immense

1274
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,520
technology and and apparatus development

1275
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,800
and and digitization all of this and

1276
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,680
unconventional Computing as well

1277
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,859
it's almost like this uh materialist

1278
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:42,480
dualism

1279
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,579
that instead of with with mind and body

1280
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:45,900
that there was some kind of dualism

1281
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,359
between the types of forces and energies

1282
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:50,579
and ways of thinking about what made the

1283
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:52,559
steam engine work and then what makes a

1284
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,480
computer work

1285
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,220
and so you'd understand how the computer

1286
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,140
could fall off a cliff but then you

1287
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,180
wouldn't necessarily be able to use that

1288
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,220
exact kind of mechanics and physics and

1289
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,440
Dynamics to study like how the computer

1290
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,020
operated but you could say it weighed 11

1291
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,280
pounds

1292
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,819
and so I think the the provocation and

1293
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:15,119
then which is as you hinted towards um

1294
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,559
first off would be awesome to have a

1295
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,480
natural language math and graphical

1296
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,400
synthesis the triple play

1297
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,000
but also then to use a common approach

1298
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,099
to understanding this

1299
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:30,720
and what wasn't working or is not

1300
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,380
proposed to work is trying to fit

1301
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,540
information

1302
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:40,319
into that non-cognitive universe

1303
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,540
but rather if we take the cognitive

1304
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,059
Primacy of communication

1305
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:46,680
then

1306
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,099
all of these forces as inferred by the

1307
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:51,780
sensorium which is all we're ever going

1308
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,940
to have totally the most valid first

1309
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,980
principles constraint to make

1310
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,800
maybe then we'll be able to have a lot

1311
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,780
more synthesis about even how steam

1312
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,160
engines work

1313
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,619
when we understand that we're Bound in

1314
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:07,740
that inference by our sensorium and all

1315
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,119
that comes along with that and the

1316
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,740
variational free energy bounding

1317
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,118
surprise on our generative model

1318
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,879
um Dean

1319
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,839
um I'm gonna I'm gonna come at this

1320
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,480
from the position of a 14 year old lens

1321
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,420
because I don't think there's anything

1322
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:28,680
unique about that

1323
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,319
um I think on

1324
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:33,119
most basic level

1325
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,400
what I took away from Chris's lecture

1326
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,140
was that there are that there's

1327
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,960
information processing of at least two

1328
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,180
types one is

1329
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:45,480
figuring it out as in figure five or any

1330
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,220
of these other figures that are up on

1331
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,920
the screen right now or

1332
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,579
anything that stabilizes

1333
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:56,040
the world around us I think examples

1334
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,300
have come up in this conversation

1335
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,020
already of apology or geometry

1336
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,460
there's a second type of information

1337
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,220
processing which is outing the figure

1338
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,099
type of information which is searching

1339
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:10,680
and I think Lexi used the expression

1340
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,300
which time

1341
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,040
are we talking about

1342
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,260
so these two types of processes are

1343
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,140
quite different if you do a comparative

1344
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,520
analysis of the two

1345
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,280
you have information practicing

1346
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,680
and you have to have both the processes

1347
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,260
to really get a sense conceptually of

1348
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,460
what it is

1349
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:32,220
the communication is really talking

1350
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,599
about

1351
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,520
if your art information practicing your

1352
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,780
way finding

1353
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,240
until you collapse to something we might

1354
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,578
describe in a verb tense as wave found

1355
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,780
it's in the quantizing of that

1356
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,420
invariance state that vast ocean if you

1357
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,579
want to think of it metaphorically out

1358
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:52,020
to all

1359
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:56,099
all Horizons on the manifold into a

1360
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:00,599
variant or a nuanced or a discretized or

1361
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:03,180
an orientation type of State

1362
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,400
where all of a sudden things like

1363
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,940
currents and temperature shifts and even

1364
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,799
think things that we've applied labels

1365
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,180
to like entropy and a transition Matrix

1366
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,500
suddenly appear out of the seam and

1367
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,700
nothingness or the invariance so

1368
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,740
that that's not the math

1369
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,660
but that's kind of stepping back and

1370
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,400
saying what is the math

1371
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,520
trying to say I think it boils down to

1372
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,980
the comparative analysis

1373
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:34,799
and then I'm hoping that in the coming

1374
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,980
lectures Chris starts opening that up

1375
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,599
and doing kind of the back and forth

1376
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,079
between the two types of of figuring it

1377
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:43,920
out

1378
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,839
and Outing the figures because I think

1379
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,579
when both are

1380
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:50,520
are part of the conversation that's when

1381
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,500
we start to get a sense of what's really

1382
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,920
going on

1383
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:04,700
thank you in this sort of closing

1384
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,740
sessions especially if anyone hasn't um

1385
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,619
added anything please

1386
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:13,380
feel free to give any

1387
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,220
last Reflections or questions arising

1388
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:22,200
so first as many people as would like

1389
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,780
can reflect that way

1390
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,960
um and then after every hand has been

1391
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,319
addressed then uh Ander if you could

1392
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:34,619
just give us a kind of look ahead so

1393
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:36,480
Avil first then anyone else with just

1394
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,839
where does this discussion take us

1395
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,760
and what do you want to continue to to

1396
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,540
learn more about evil

1397
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:49,020
oh uh so two things first if I work out

1398
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,119
of here without understanding what is a

1399
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:55,799
common name I will be disappointed

1400
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:58,559
and uh I I don't have to expect it to

1401
01:00:58,559 --> 01:00:59,819
happen in like

1402
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:02,240
12 hours that seems like it's something

1403
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,940
but more uh seriously I

1404
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,460
basically I can I can agree with that

1405
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,079
difficulty that there is Unity between

1406
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,599
like physical structure and

1407
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:14,520
communication protocols

1408
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,180
but and that communication Protocols are

1409
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,000
quantum reference frame kind of

1410
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,559
individuate physical States individuate

1411
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,140
meaningful measurement outcome that rra

1412
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,660
file as physical possibilities

1413
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,660
but the question is then where do

1414
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,940
communication protocols slash Quantum

1415
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,059
reference frame come from like what are

1416
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,040
the physical determinants that bring

1417
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:41,819
about those things and uh that seems

1418
01:01:41,819 --> 01:01:43,260
like a question that could be addressed

1419
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,480
at the conceptual level of this course

1420
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,520
and I would like uh

1421
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,000
I I saw the live stream 17.

1422
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,660
so that did not help uh anyway

1423
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:55,680
um

1424
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,400
yeah I would like to uh to other more

1425
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,339
grip into that if we can just it will be

1426
01:02:02,339 --> 01:02:05,280
different courses thank you

1427
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,059
thank you

1428
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,880
anyone else especially if they haven't

1429
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,940
added anything yet

1430
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,819
want to give kind of a closing

1431
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:20,299
thought

1432
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:34,200
yeah there's a lot to learn and Chris

1433
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,599
brings up a lot in his lecture even

1434
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:38,099
though we've only had one it's one of

1435
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:40,020
the denser hours

1436
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:41,780
of

1437
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,160
epistemic resourcing

1438
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,839
that I've seen

1439
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:48,240
and there's also all of these accessory

1440
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,359
and Cutting Edge works that that Andre's

1441
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:52,680
showing

1442
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,359
so

1443
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:56,819
um I'm really looking forward to how we

1444
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:59,220
can continue to curate and improve the

1445
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,140
questions that we have

1446
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,059
so that the uncertainties in our

1447
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:05,040
generative model that we have how would

1448
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,200
this be useful what does this mean why

1449
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,180
is this variable this way what is the

1450
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,520
implication for that those are all the

1451
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,099
great questions and let's just get them

1452
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:17,520
inscribed on our classical documents

1453
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,280
so that we can have other Quantum

1454
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,020
cognitive agents reduce their

1455
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:23,280
uncertainty

1456
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,760
by looking at the responses

1457
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,260
so with that

1458
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,660
I wonder if you could just look ahead to

1459
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,579
lecture two

1460
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:35,460
and just like Point towards where we're

1461
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,720
going to be

1462
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,200
going

1463
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,380
uh yes so

1464
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:46,140
so lecture two will I think from what I

1465
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,000
heard from Chris is gonna start to

1466
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,380
address

1467
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:51,240
is uh

1468
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,460
you know basic pathological aspects of

1469
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,819
the quantum measurement so the the two

1470
01:03:56,819 --> 01:04:00,500
sources to look at would be

1471
01:04:01,859 --> 01:04:04,920
two papers mainly this one physical

1472
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,680
meaning of the holographic principle I

1473
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,900
this one's by far the most pedagogical

1474
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,220
one so

1475
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,140
if I had to if I had to suggest that

1476
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,760
folks look at one it would be this one

1477
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,000
it's very easy to read I think uh but

1478
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,339
maybe for a bit more detail

1479
01:04:20,339 --> 01:04:23,220
there's the slightly older one and they

1480
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,680
talk at length about corn cocoa and the

1481
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,480
high grounds here

1482
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,540
um

1483
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,740
free energy principle for genetic

1484
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,020
content systems and so I think that's

1485
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,119
what's going to come in these two

1486
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:38,099
lectures basically the main ideas Behind

1487
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:40,619
These two papers

1488
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:45,079
Anya that's all I have to say

1489
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,780
all right well

1490
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,059
thank you for all who joined this first

1491
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:52,380
discussion

1492
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,660
hope that it was

1493
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:57,180
fun for you and for the audience

1494
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,460
and

1495
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,319
check out the course site for the

1496
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:03,119
readings to get ahead of the second

1497
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,280
lecture we'll all

1498
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:10,160
watch the second lecture and come back

1499
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,540
in about a month for the second

1500
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,640
discussion everyone's welcome to join

1501
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,319
and the website has the registration

1502
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:19,859
information and so now that we've seen a

1503
01:05:19,859 --> 01:05:21,960
little bit of one way it can be

1504
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,240
we may do something similar or we may do

1505
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,059
