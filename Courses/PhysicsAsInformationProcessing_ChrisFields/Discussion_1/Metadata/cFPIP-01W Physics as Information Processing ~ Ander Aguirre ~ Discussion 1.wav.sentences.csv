6000	7676	2	B	0.98519	Hello and welcome, everyone.
7858	10364	3	B	0.86187	It's June 3, 2023.
10482	16584	4	B	0.9192	We're in the first discussion section for Physics as information processing course with Chris Fields.
16712	20872	5	B	0.60605	So welcome to all who are here on and off camera.
20936	26904	6	B	0.99995	Really exciting to see so many people joining for this participatory discussion section.
27032	41588	7	B	0.57602	So in this first interval, we're going to go to anyone who raises their hand, and it would be awesome to hear from everyone who would like to share what excites them about what they heard in the first lecture.
41764	47348	8	B	0.58907	How has their background and journey led to them joining?
47444	53770	9	B	0.99995	What are they hoping to learn and do in this course?
54300	60060	10	B	0.67472	So firsthand we'll get to go, maybe.
60130	63880	11	B	0.50526	Ander you can actually start first, just speaking as a normal participant.
63960	66850	12	B	1	And then meanwhile, anyone is welcome to raise their hands.
67540	68384	13	A	0.89818	That sounds good.
68422	78836	14	A	0.76503	So I am a mathematician by training, but I've always been interested in the more physics side of things.
79018	88180	15	A	1	And in particular, I followed Chris's work pretty closely since probably 2019.
91580	96490	16	A	0.71628	I'm just very interested in the whole ontology of quantum measurement, what it means.
97020	102890	17	A	0.68	I feel like very often when it's taught in physics classes, it's hand waved away.
103260	119244	18	A	0.98	And even though I myself subscribe to the philosophy of shut up and compute, sometimes not everything you need to do a little bit of philosophy, maybe, and this may be one of the things where you need to do it and you need to address it from first principles.
119292	119456	19	A	0.76677	Right?
119478	120928	20	A	1	And I think Chris is doing that.
121014	123712	21	A	0.99315	So I'm just here to learn more.
123846	126290	22	A	0.76	And yeah, that's basically it.
127700	128220	23	B	0.99999	Awesome.
128310	133270	24	B	0.95437	I'll just go from the top left because I'm not necessarily watching, like, what order, but Ross first.
135960	136710	25	C	0.97636	Hi.
138360	163580	26	C	0.7713	I'm interested in the kind of overlap between cognitive science and physics and seeing if there are any panpsychist implications of the observation that physical processes seem to follow the same kind of principle that we see applied to brains and cognitive systems.
166560	167080	27	B	0.99983	Awesome.
167170	168480	28	B	0.99982	Thank you. Avel?
171540	172096	29	D	0.53989	Hi.
172198	174160	30	D	0.7472	I'm Avel Guenin-Carlut.
174980	182192	31	D	0.55	I have mixed backgrounds, mostly physics and cognitive science.
182256	187712	32	D	0.99991	Right now, I could be qualified as a philosopher of physics and cognitive science.
187856	197480	33	D	0.85	And I'm interested in basically formalizing participatorialism, the idea that observer participates in creating reality.
197820	204036	34	D	0.8	I did some work in formalizing that in the case of social norms and things like language.
204228	212780	35	D	0.96	And I met a block based on my lack of knowledge of quantum physics and the mathematical tools that I used for that.
212850	217180	36	D	0.99998	So I'm here in a course to get those formal skills.
219300	219856	37	B	0.99954	Awesome.
219958	220384	38	B	0.99984	Thank you,
220422	221680	39	B	0.70684	Avel. Bleu?
224660	226530	40	E	1	I think Alexey was first.
227140	229104	41	B	0.99844	Okay, Alexey, go for it.
229302	230050	42	E	0.46961	Sorry.
230500	231640	43	F	0.94637	Hi, I'm Alexey.
231660	233632	44	F	0.50057	I'm a clinical psychologist in Maryland.
233696	234308	45	F	0.92234	In the States.
234394	237264	46	F	1	I work with patients, do psychotherapy mostly.
237392	252440	47	F	0.99999	My interest came through Mark Solms, who is the creator and leader of neuropsychoanalysis, and he has been collaborating with Friston on “the hard problem of consciousness,” and he's now working on AI with emotions.
254620	255464	48	F	1	I blame him.
255502	262424	49	F	1	I say it with respect and love that for introducing mathematics into our field, which was mostly devoid of mathematics.
262472	267740	50	F	1	And people started looking at these partial differential equations and Markov blankets.
267900	278140	51	F	0.99951	So I wrote a paper about a possible extension of their model to include chaos theory and I just want to understand deeper concepts involved.
278220	280944	52	F	0.88	I have some understanding of them, but perhaps not enough.
280982	283090	53	F	1	And I'm enjoying this course a great deal.
283480	291888	54	F	1	I think Chris, among other things, is a fantastic teacher and he is able to express things very clearly and I have awe – I have goosebumps.
291904	295130	55	F	0.99986	So I'm very grateful to everybody and thank you so much.
296700	297256	56	B	0.99957	Cool.
297358	298072	57	B	0.99814	Bleu. Then, Francesco.
298126	301368	58	E	0.85742	Hi, everyone.
301454	302404	59	E	0.9247	I'm Bleu Knight.
302452	304656	60	E	0.97344	I'm with the Active Inference Institute.
304708	314924	61	E	0.98959	So I've been tracking this work of Chris's connecting quantum information and Active Inference for, I don't know, a couple of years now.
315042	325292	62	E	0.99989	Through that thread, I'm super interested actually in the aspect of spacetime arising from communication.
325356	343400	63	E	1	I think that that's like fascinating to dive into and how it connects to the Buddhist and maybe more Eastern religion concept of dependent arising, like how the interdependence of all things leads to their existence.
344540	345412	64	E	0.99998	From that aspect.
345476	355212	65	E	1	I think that's what I'm most interested in exploring my background is neuroscience, but I've also been studying practicing Buddhism for like 25 years.
355346	357292	66	E	0.87855	So yeah, that's it.
357346	357950	67	E	0.99984	Thanks.
359600	360060	68	B	0.99973	Awesome.
360130	361020	69	B	0.47018	Francesco. Then, Corby.
361090	363452	70	G	0.87571	Thanks, 
363506	364460	71	G	0.97496	Daniel. Ciao, everyone!
364530	365804	72	G	0.99917	Super happy to be here.
365922	371148	73	G	1	I also have a mixed background because I studied cognitive anthropology and philosophy of science.
371244	379056	74	G	1	And currently a few months ago I started a PhD in artificial intelligence in an 8th application in the educational field.
379238	388976	75	G	0.57	And yes, I'm actually super excited about all the science based implications that Chris Fields mentioned in the first lecture.
389088	400808	76	G	0.68	The connection I have no background in physics, but the connections between the first principles, physics and free energy principle and scientific cognition in general is what is really getting me excited in these days.
400974	401930	77	B	0.99997	Thank you.
404620	405224	78	B	0.99841	Cool.
405342	406156	79	B	0.65878	Corby. Then,
406178	408190	80	B	0.99936	anyone else who raises their hand.
410320	411916	81	H	0.93606	Yeah, great to be here.
412018	414856	82	H	0.92551	My background is in quantum engineering.
415048	419404	83	H	0.98421	I've always been motivated by figuring out what the next big thing in computing was.
419442	428912	84	H	0.61661	In high school, Moore’s Law was sort of coming to an end and it seemed like a really big opportunity to figure out what the next big computing architecture might be.
428966	434672	85	H	0.99996	So I did academic research in neuromorphic computing, quantum computing and quantum sensors.
434736	438292	86	H	1	And I felt like I was a little bit too early for all of those things.
438346	444616	87	H	0.99981	So I went into cloud and cloud gaming and streaming AI services.
444798	450132	88	H	0.99998	But I'm still extremely motivated to figure out what the next big thing is. And the Holographic principle
450196	452884	89	H	0.99475	seems like a good foundation to explore
452932	453530	90	A	0.84509	that.
457250	458000	91	B	0.99847	Awesome.
458370	459934	92	B	0.6667	I'll raise my own hand then.
459972	462142	93	B	0.9996	Anyone else is welcome to go.
462276	463550	94	B	0.99881	So, I'm Daniel.
463970	475742	95	B	0.93113	I'm a researcher at the institute and have known ander for some years and learned about all kinds of Stochastic matrices and how the math and the quantum were linked.
475886	481294	96	B	1	And we had talked and joked about learning from Chris Fields for a long time.
481432	499260	97	B	0.97977	So when the opportunity arose to enact it and extend it and open it, we were very excited and also don't have much of a formal background in physics outside of working with Yaaka bin Ali on Live stream 49.
501310	506780	98	B	0.99993	So it's just going to be a great time to learn and see where it all goes.
511010	516590	99	B	0.99983	Anyone else want to say hello in this kind of opening section?
523700	537284	100	B	0.97698	Okay, well, continuing forward, of course, please just feel free to raise your hand anytime you'd like to jump into the stack. Andre, for several minutes or however you see,
537402	542390	101	B	0.99998	could you reflect on Lecture One?
543080	545670	102	B	0.99999	Where did Chris enter?
546040	547344	103	B	0.90465	How did he proceed?
547392	550170	104	B	1	And where did the lecture take us?
553660	554650	105	B	0.99994	Thank you.
555100	555896	106	A	0.98364	Yeah.
556078	558760	107	B	0.5943	{Can you zoom in a little bit more on the PDF?}
561440	562380	108	A	0.98249	{Can you hear me?}
562450	563036	109	B	0.99995	{Thank you.}
563138	564060	110	B	0.98079	{Go for it.}
564210	567212	111	A	0.9623	Let's take a look at the slides from last time.
567346	583520	112	A	0.80522	So I think if we were to summarize this whole lecture, basically what Chris was trying to say is that there are many hands coming from different directions, pointing at the same thing, right?
583590	595364	113	A	0.99981	Pointing at the fact that information will have a central aspect in physics in the future, but also possibly biology, right?
595402	607112	114	A	0.50097	So the earliest hints came from statistical mechanics, if you wish, but also quantum mechanics, right?
607166	614700	115	A	0.92	And here we need to make an important but subtle distinction between what it is, the uncertainty principle, right?
614770	618636	116	A	0.99751	Because we think of that as the informational part, right?
618658	624720	117	A	0.99945	Like a limit on the resolution on information and what is the observer effect.
624870	626624	118	A	1	Just to make that distinction clear.
626742	630464	119	A	1	I think Chris is talking about the observer effect.
630662	638768	120	A	0.93	The uncertainty principle is an artifact of the wave nature of quantum mechanics, right?
638934	643664	121	A	0.99988	You can get it from properties of the Fourier transform, cautious words, inequality.
643792	647444	122	A	0.77655	But at the end of the day, it's what I was saying earlier, right?
647642	650984	123	A	0.99325	What is the basic picture of measurement, right?
651022	656650	124	A	1	And that's sort of what Crease with Glazebrook and Marciana is trying to address.
657260	666060	125	A	0.96	And the first two hints came from quantum mechanics around 1900 and statistical mechanics a few decades earlier.
666640	670124	126	A	0.99457	Then there's more stuff, right?
670162	690016	127	A	0.69292	Like, obviously physicists resisted to inertia of hundreds of years of a totally objective, observer independent universe, but the hints continued to pile on some stuff coming from math.
690128	704680	128	A	0.99999	But perhaps the most interesting is, again, how all those paradoxes from statistical mechanics were made sense of with Landauers proposal.
705180	715012	129	A	1	And then as physics got more fancy past QFT and stuff, people started thinking about quantum information more seriously.
715076	720990	130	A	0.99994	So we had Bell Serum and all these proposals by Deutsche and Wheeler and so on.
721680	726780	131	A	0.98	And I should say that this is not a fringe idea in physics.
727200	730572	132	A	0.89	The paradigm of it from qubit is very much mainstream.
730636	732000	133	A	0.99	I mean, Google it.
732070	735056	134	A	0.79	A lot of physicists think about it.
735158	737556	135	A	1	I don't know how many of them talk about it.
737578	746420	136	A	0.99998	Openly, but it's been a widespread folk intuition, so to speak, that information will have this sort of central role.
747080	756024	137	A	0.71	And the last sort of hints pointing in that direction of information having a central law came on the one side from high energy stuff.
756142	758904	138	A	1	And that's what the Holographic principle is.
759102	770568	139	A	0.94799	It originally arose in the context of black hole thermodynamics, but then it was extended to what's called the Ads CFT correspondence.
770664	778690	140	A	1	And the very most recent stuff was basically one side from high energy stuff.
779540	782988	141	A	0.86069	Sorry, I can speak a little more loudly.
783164	783904	142	B	0.81619	It's all good.
783942	784288	143	B	0.9894	Continue.
784374	785120	144	B	0.41401	Honor.
785620	787396	145	A	0.98021	Yeah, I thought there was a question.
787578	788608	146	B	0.62852	Someone was just unmuted.
788624	789508	147	B	0.99764	It's all good.
789674	790390	148	A	0.98983	Okay.
791000	791604	149	A	0.63521	Yeah.
791722	793430	150	A	0.69133	So that's basically it, right?
794680	804664	151	A	0.58395	There's hints from many directions, and most recently the work of Friston and Levin coming from biology, all pointing in the same direction, right.
804702	817800	152	A	0.86491	That we might have to make sense of some sort of eventually scale free information processing per data for what it means to be an observer.
819280	821528	153	A	0.99976	All of these things are pointing in that direction.
821624	824812	154	A	1	And I think Chris's work is addressing that head on.
824866	825372	155	A	0.9919	Right.
825506	836210	156	A	1	As I said earlier, sometimes it's good to do computations, but sometimes you need to take a step back and think more philosophically about what you're doing and what the bigger picture is.
839960	845716	157	A	1	And then maybe after people talk a little bit, we can warm up to the second lecture.
845908	851370	158	A	1	The other windows that I have open here, some of them are the papers that are to come.
853600	854300	159	A	0.9312	Yeah.
854450	854812	160	A	0.99922	Anyone?
854866	857676	161	B	1	Please feel free to raise your hand on this.
857698	859390	162	B	0.5398	Alexey and then anyone else?
861760	869372	163	F	0.8	I had one thought about this thing when you mentioned that there's various perspectives on the same concept.
869436	871164	164	F	1	And I'm trying to be cautious.
871212	880272	165	F	1	On the one hand, I think, again, this amazing clarity and precision with which Chris expressed thoughts is fantastic and enjoyable.
880336	883680	166	F	1	On the other hand, it requires simplification and generalization.
883760	888916	167	F	0.96	And what I observe in my field is people take a term like entropy and run with it.
889018	894276	168	F	1	And then they get very quickly from thermodynamic entropy to Shannon to whatever entropy.
894308	897752	169	F	1	And they talk about sort of and that's not the case.
897806	904424	170	F	0.88	I mean, if we go back to Klausius and all the others, there was a system of postulates and axioms that must be maintained.
904552	908776	171	F	1	And if you step outside of that so, like us organisms, we're open systems.
908808	909944	172	F	0.99564	We're not closed systems.
909992	911656	173	F	0.61103	So we should not apply directly.
911688	919600	174	F	0.99	Second law thermodynamics and I deal a little more with comogorphs and eye entropy, which is not the same thing.
919750	936368	175	F	1	And I guess when we very quickly move from sort of thermodynamics to statistical mechanics with Boltzman to all the way around and we assume it is the same thing, I think we may need to be careful because we are just ignoring the differences in assumptions.
936544	938716	176	F	0.92667	Shannon talked about telegraph.
938768	942792	177	F	0.94613	He talked about a receiver getting a message from a sender, right?
942926	946760	178	F	0.96	And Clausius talked about gas.
948460	953412	179	F	0.99992	But I do think it's a balancing act and there's no way to not have simplification and generalization.
953476	961688	180	F	1	I just wanted to say somewhere, somehow we need to kind of go back there and just say entropy is not entropy is not entropy.
961784	965810	181	F	1	And all these things are kind of long papers, right?
978660	979120	182	A	0.63409	Yes.
979190	982210	183	B	0.37638	Yakub, then Ali, then anyone else?
987240	1014590	184	A	0.99	I just wanted to ask for, I guess perhaps slightly longer comment from Alexi on what you see as the fundamental differences in different descriptions of entropy and whether there is some general concept that could be extracted from all of them, such as level of information or uncertainty about a particular system.
1014960	1038530	185	A	0.99999	Even though these specific formulations of entropy, they talk about, they were derived from different specific systems and they have different equations describing them and they mean slightly different things, do you think it would be wrong to say that there is some commonality between them?
1042410	1044860	186	F	0.55685	Should I answer Daniel or yeah, please.
1046030	1052774	187	F	1	I don't know, I just think we need to at some point formalize it and be careful with these generalizations.
1052822	1057166	188	F	0.99999	For example, when we talk about Active Inference and Kristen right.
1057348	1062394	189	F	0.9997	When we say living organisms must minimize I'm quoting Kristen, by the way, these are not my thoughts.
1062522	1065438	190	F	1	The entropy of sensory states, right?
1065604	1071918	191	F	1	And then people take that idea sometimes and generalize and they say that that's what life is, minimization of entropy.
1071934	1072402	192	F	0.82813	Right?
1072536	1080200	193	F	0.77401	But if you actually look into human brain and measure entropy, then it goes all over the place, up, down and in between.
1080730	1084082	194	F	0.82	And so I don't think that's an accurate description.
1084146	1087890	195	F	1	And the reason for that is where we shifted away from the assumptions.
1087970	1103078	196	F	0.66	And again, so comagorfsini entropy talks about the phase space and the divergence of trajectories in phase space and sort of the volume and face space, while when you talk about this Briston's entropy of sensory states, these are probability distributions.
1103254	1109546	197	F	1	And Shannon talked about the uncertainty of the receiver, about the message sent by the sender.
1109658	1113086	198	F	0.99991	So if you want to extract the same thing, I suppose you can.
1113188	1119042	199	F	0.99996	But it's important not to lose at least the difference between what kind of object are we applying to?
1119096	1121134	200	F	0.99999	Are we looking at probability distributions?
1121182	1122402	201	F	0.99994	Are we looking at phase space?
1122456	1124078	202	F	0.62055	Are we looking at ideal gas?
1124174	1125122	203	F	0.99999	Where are we at?
1125176	1129298	204	F	0.96	And we're just not to say entropy is entropy is entropy.
1129314	1130310	205	F	0.98398	That's not the case.
1130460	1136920	206	F	0.68563	It's just a formula, but depending on the context, assumptions and things, it can be very different.
1142870	1144206	207	B	0.99997	Thanks, Ali.
1144318	1145490	208	B	1	And Avel.
1147990	1148450	209	I	0.99994	Yes.
1148520	1169894	210	I	0.99999	In regard to Alex's comments, I just wanted to mention the research of people like Rudolph Hannel and Stefan Surger, because for many years they've been exploring this idea of different conceptions of entropy and they've come up with at least a dozen different meanings for entropy.
1169942	1201410	211	I	1	And they've formulated it in a kind of generalized framework, but at the same time, they've also devised a way to somehow classify them into equivalence classes and to see whether one or more of those conceptions of entropy can be theoretically derived from some others or they're totally distinct and different conceptions of entropy.
1201490	1210540	212	I	0.99986	So, yes, I agree that in some situations, we need to be more specific about what exactly we mean by entropy and information.
1212190	1216940	213	I	0.61	I mean, based on the question or the situation of interest.
1219230	1220570	214	B	0.99995	Thanks, Avil.
1223870	1229754	215	D	0.98233	So, just to vote in the entropy discussion, I want to emphasize that entropy is PLNP.
1229802	1241380	216	D	0.99493	So it's a function of probability distribution, which is I think I'm not sure what the term is in English, but it's a measure of how big something is in a space.
1241830	1244754	217	D	1	And to get that, you have to define a space.
1244872	1249254	218	D	1	And in many case, it's pretty arbitrary to decide what the space you're looking at is.
1249372	1258310	219	D	1	For example, you talk I don't know if it was Alexa, someone talked about entropy of fMRI.
1258810	1262422	220	D	0.99983	Well, those are aggregate measurements of general activity.
1262486	1266054	221	D	0.99998	This is not the space of all possible configuration.
1266182	1282660	222	D	0.68	And even if I add something like the space of all, let's say, functional configuration, the state in neuron that reflect activity, this would be another thing than the space of atomic configuration, where the specific atom are.
1285510	1291540	223	D	0.97579	You don't have a warranty that when you define entropy, you define it on a meaningful space that's not given.
1295350	1300210	224	D	1	I kind of think there is one entropy and that's it, and it's an info construct.
1300370	1306002	225	D	0.76628	But also we have to if we agree to that, then it entails that we have to find it.
1306076	1309180	226	D	0.65518	It's not just given out there in the data.
1323880	1336088	227	B	0.66475	Well, certainly being precise in the formalism and in natural language for what we mean by information and entropy and all these terms is pretty important.
1336174	1340220	228	B	0.75	I mean, the course we're in is physics as information processing.
1340880	1361440	229	B	0.99995	But without an understanding of how information is being meant here or what measurements and transformations were performing what informational operations, then it is a non sequitur.
1361780	1378810	230	B	0.4996	So how do we go about clarifying or understanding what kinds of theoretical results in a given domain or, like, what is shown on the timeline here might apply to some other area?
1383190	1384500	231	B	0.99994	Just one thought.
1385270	1390820	232	B	0.99991	Anyone else can raise their hand with a thought or a question.
1391670	1400200	233	B	0.78654	Otherwise honor, you can maybe flip over to select a few of the submitted questions.
1403710	1404362	234	B	0.99936	Cool.
1404496	1408220	235	B	0.99997	Could you zoom in with control plus a fair amount?
1412640	1413484	236	B	0.64556	Thanks.
1413682	1417628	237	B	0.83987	So, everyone, we really appreciate the submitted questions.
1417714	1422210	238	B	0.99851	We've been able to get 13 answered by Chris so far.
1422820	1431824	239	B	1	And as with the transcripts of the discussions and lectures, the questions and answers are going to be part of what is published by the Octemf Journal.
1431952	1442336	240	B	0.99983	So we really encourage basic questions, advanced questions, just there's no question that doesn't make sense to submit.
1442528	1455130	241	B	0.99898	So, Andre, maybe just pick one question that you think is interesting to begin with and summarize Chris's response, and then everyone else is welcome to kind of add some other thoughts on this.
1456700	1459976	242	A	0.9827	So, I'm going to scroll up and down just to sort of sample.
1460168	1461884	243	A	0.99992	Let me start with the first two.
1462002	1462716	244	A	0.89147	Can you hear me?
1462738	1463068	245	A	0.72181	Well?
1463154	1468172	246	A	0.92541	Yes, since perhaps I think you submitted this as a trial, right?
1468306	1469068	247	A	0.96457	Is that right?
1469154	1469836	248	A	0.99892	Yeah.
1470018	1471148	249	A	0.56292	So what is information?
1471234	1472270	250	A	0.9988	What is time?
1473920	1475228	251	A	0.97191	Here is Chris's response.
1475244	1477568	252	A	1	I guess everyone has a chance to look at it.
1477654	1492916	253	A	0.99962	Now, if I am to summarize this, the one thing I've heard that personally, the one I like the most, answer, at least as an Adash, to summarize it, is that information are differences that make a difference.
1493018	1495384	254	A	0.95194	This I might have heard from Chris, I might have heard from someone else.
1495422	1496504	255	A	1	I don't remember.
1496702	1498250	256	A	0.94279	But that's one thing.
1498700	1507820	257	A	0.99997	Now, onto the question of what is time, and I guess this also addresses Alex's question of what is entropy.
1510160	1510536	258	B	0.99908	I'll.
1510568	1512684	259	A	0.99999	Make a bigger point now.
1512882	1513820	260	A	0.99967	What is time?
1513890	1542756	261	A	0.61096	This is partially addressed, and I guess the main thing I'll be doing here is rather than look back, look forward into what's to come in the course, in particular, I'm thinking about these two papers and in particular, and I finally chat with Chris about this this picture over here.
1542858	1543510	262	A	0.97209	Okay.
1544120	1544870	263	B	0.65	More?
1545320	1546070	264	A	0.97835	Yeah.
1546760	1548420	265	A	0.60831	I'll get back to it in a bit.
1548490	1553432	266	A	0.99999	But basically, this sort of, like, kills two birds with a stone, right?
1553566	1559364	267	A	0.99997	This picture, and especially the text around it, and the title of this paper is The Physical Meaning of the Holographic Principle.
1559492	1559880	268	A	0.83509	Okay.
1559950	1565136	269	A	0.99708	You guys can see here archive 22, ten, blah, blah, blah.
1565188	1583504	270	A	0.95977	Anyways, this addresses the notion of time and entropy, because the claim that's made in this paper is that these are local observer relative definitions, and we can look into more detail around it.
1583542	1599210	271	A	0.99865	But basically, the coordinate ta time is an entropic measure, so it is non decreasing, and it goes up with the observer measuring entropy in the system.
1600060	1602084	272	A	1	Because of the symmetry of the definition.
1602212	1604008	273	A	1	The second law applies to both.
1604094	1612380	274	A	0.66612	So both observer and environment see entropy increasing in their environment and vice versa.
1613280	1620184	275	A	0.99313	Anyways, from this picture, one gets that you have this internal circle time QRF.
1620232	1633120	276	A	0.99973	So this just is a necessary artifact of recording information into a memory that's the claim made in the paper, and that essentially induces the passage of time, at least from the perspective of the observer.
1635080	1643856	277	A	0.8865	It also, I think, Alexey was talking about, which I totally understand and agree that there's different notions of entropy.
1643968	1658440	278	A	0.99983	Now, I suppose I would be the one to like definitions and so on, but I but I do think it's it's it's good to to have a certain amount of flexibility.
1659340	1663256	279	A	0.61561	So I see it the same as energy, right?
1663278	1664840	280	A	0.94032	Like, there are different kinds of energy.
1664910	1666804	281	A	0.54968	You know, there's energy mass equivalences.
1666852	1673470	282	A	0.51	And, you know, if you push it into supersymmetry, you can think of it as equivalent to force also.
1674000	1679100	283	A	1	But I do think there is some value in being sloppy or intuitive about the notion.
1679180	1683228	284	A	0.92192	So the fact that entropy yes, there are different definitions.
1683404	1687156	285	A	1	I don't see it quite as a problem one can explore here.
1687258	1694150	286	A	0.73481	Around this page, there is a definition of local entropic time.
1696360	1703264	287	A	1	One can think of it as face pace, or one can think of it as coding theory, alashanum.
1703312	1709824	288	A	0.99997	But it is at the end of the day, I do think it is true that both of them are hinting at the same direction.
1709892	1717420	289	A	0.99979	Just like you may have different kinds of energy, but they're not unrelated concepts.
1718080	1718396	290	A	0.51127	Yeah.
1718418	1723920	291	A	1	I hope one day we get very precise definitions out of everything, but for now, I think it's good to speculate.
1725540	1726290	292	A	0.99713	Okay.
1728420	1728736	293	A	0.98891	Yeah.
1728758	1730690	294	B	0.87355	Corby and then anyone else on this?
1731780	1732784	295	H	0.57293	Yeah, quick question.
1732822	1742980	296	H	0.99918	So I haven't read that specific paper, but is there any work on the frequency or the rate at which one could read and write information on the boundary?
1743640	1750108	297	A	0.99997	Yes, well, I can't think of the paper exactly, but this is lower bounded.
1750144	1753524	298	A	1	I think Chris talked about it, if not in the last lecture.
1753652	1756132	299	A	1	I think I've seen a talk of him on YouTube.
1756196	1758420	300	A	0.99997	It's lower bounded by the uncertainty principle.
1758500	1759130	301	A	0.5822	Right.
1761420	1768108	302	A	0.99992	For instance, Planck's constant is in units of action, which is energy times time.
1768194	1768588	303	A	0.97108	Right.
1768674	1777744	304	A	0.65549	So Landauer's principle says you need a certain amount of energy to erase information and you have time.
1777782	1777936	305	A	0.98361	Right.
1777958	1788660	306	A	1	And then you have an energy time and certain principle putting those things together, you have a minimum amount of action, which is literally the minimum.
1789400	1791456	307	A	0.95	The action is measuring what I said earlier.
1791488	1791876	308	A	0.69834	Right.
1791978	1795924	309	A	0.82805	Like differences that make a difference, the minimum difference that you can make.
1796042	1803800	310	A	0.99994	So the minimum difference to erase a bit or rewrite it on the boundary, so to speak.
1803870	1804490	311	A	0.99976	Right.
1805260	1809130	312	A	0.99946	So, yeah, that would be given by the uncertain relation, energy times time.
1809500	1813950	313	A	1	I don't know exactly what the figure is, but it's obviously very small compared to everyday life.
1815520	1816124	314	H	0.99977	Got it.
1816162	1818232	315	H	0.89	And is there work on the upper bound?
1818296	1822340	316	H	0.82129	Like, for example, would it be the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary?
1822520	1825280	317	A	0.93435	No, I don't think it's bounded from above.
1825620	1832156	318	A	0.99609	But obviously then we do want to bond it from above for technological reasons, if you wish.
1832188	1838720	319	A	0.83249	But I think that is an engineering problem, not one of physics.
1841300	1844390	320	B	0.27141	Andre, a few questions on this figure.
1846120	1848230	321	B	0.99996	What are Y and E?
1849740	1857284	322	B	1	The blue oval, as Chris has pointed out, is going to consistently be the screen, the blanket.
1857412	1862952	323	B	1	And so we often associate that with at least some blankets.
1863016	1867400	324	B	0.99787	Include these information gathering and utilizing systems.
1867560	1873616	325	B	0.99928	So what is happening internal to the agent here?
1873798	1876352	326	B	0.99953	What kind of computation is happening?
1876486	1881360	327	B	1	And is this something that is actually proposed to be occurring?
1881940	1886980	328	B	0.62895	Or is this a schematic or a map of how we could think about something occurring?
1890680	1896020	329	A	0.93	I think this question is going to be better addressed by Chris himself, probably in the next lecture.
1897240	1910716	330	A	0.98393	For now, what I can say is I can reiterate what I was trying to say earlier, which is that what this addresses and this basic measurement picture, so to speak, is the observer effect, right?
1910738	1918200	331	A	0.96275	Like this notion that you cannot observe something without disturbing the environment.
1918360	1938868	332	A	0.99995	So if you then try to make sense of this by constraining from first principles, land hours, principle and so on, basic requirements on information processing from the point of view of energy, then you get that this boundary is constrained in some ways, right?
1939034	1948484	333	A	0.99993	This Y is what's called the memory sector, meaning that you don't just act on the immediate information that you perceive.
1948532	1959396	334	A	0.99954	You may also act on stuff that's stored that you have perceived before then sure, e, the red part is what you're perceiving right now, the environment.
1959588	1967576	335	A	0.99997	But actually I don't know if I have it in here, but this is further broken up into other parts.
1967688	1971550	336	A	0.99905	So not schematically here, let me try to find it over here.
1982760	1986228	337	A	0.84325	Now, I don't know, actually, bear with me for a second.
1986314	1987750	338	A	0.87	I think you might be here.
1994340	2001068	339	A	0.97721	That's the same picture anyways.
2001244	2007684	340	A	1	I don't want to waste time by trying to find it, but back to the original picture sure.
2007882	2026044	341	A	0.94102	What you're measuring, and again, Chris will talk about this in more detail, but from first principle assumptions, they deduce that you're going to have to deploy your finite resources for gathering information in clever ways on the boundary, right?
2026082	2034092	342	A	0.99987	So you're going to have to deploy some resources for memory, some resources as a heat sink, right?
2034146	2049816	343	A	0.99998	So you're going to be processing information, you're going to be dumping so called low quality stuff into the environment, you're going to be dumping heat and then other than the memory, you're going to be focusing on what's going on right now in this environment.
2049868	2057760	344	A	0.7	And what I wanted to say is that it can be further broken up into what's called pointer and reference sectors.
2057920	2066564	345	A	0.99994	So you can imagine this e sector here has to be broken into further sectors because then there is the other first principle notion.
2066612	2066920	346	A	0.99967	Okay?
2066990	2070232	347	A	0.99941	So what does it mean to observe something?
2070366	2072312	348	A	0.96	The differences that make a difference, right?
2072366	2077148	349	A	0.98321	So there is only information with context, right?
2077234	2079020	350	A	0.554	There is no information per se.
2079090	2080204	351	A	0.97571	It's all semantics, right?
2080242	2083416	352	A	0.99994	So you only observe things in context.
2083608	2091504	353	A	0.82397	So some things are going to have to stay the same, namely reference states here, and some things are going to bear, right?
2091542	2094112	354	A	0.99997	So you can think of this as the gauge in your car, right?
2094246	2102048	355	A	0.99999	Obviously the circle stays the same and that's your context, so to speak, with the numbers in it.
2102134	2104016	356	A	0.9897	They never go away, they stay the same.
2104118	2107348	357	A	0.5413	But as you speed up or down, the gauge is going to change.
2107434	2113590	358	A	1	And that's how you know only in that context you can tell your own speed when you're driving a car, right?
2114120	2117610	359	A	0.99782	So anyways, this is just a teaser for things to come.
2118700	2120200	360	A	0.80803	We can go back to more questions.
2120270	2121544	361	A	0.46182	Daniel, what do you think?
2121662	2124330	362	A	0.67453	I'll pick maybe two or three more over here.
2126140	2126660	363	A	0.99924	Yeah.
2126750	2132750	364	B	0.81011	Pick another question, or anyone raising their hand, or if anyone in the live chat wants to write something, I'll read it.
2133840	2135496	365	B	0.89269	How about the WIC rotation?
2135608	2141010	366	B	0.99988	Could you summarize what the WIC rotation is and then state this question about it?
2142660	2144050	367	A	0.99997	That's a great question.
2144740	2146112	368	A	1	I wish I knew the answer better.
2146166	2158100	369	A	0.99985	But formally speaking, the Wick rotation is just so Chris said, you take a quantity multiply by I square root of negative one.
2158170	2162132	370	A	0.99999	That amounts to a 90 degree rotation in a complex plane.
2162276	2162824	371	A	0.99934	Fine.
2162942	2165000	372	A	0.56087	Now, that appears to be a trick.
2165420	2174010	373	A	0.99	And what it does effectively is take you from quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics, roughly speaking.
2176060	2180936	374	A	0.99986	Now, why it works, I have no clue.
2180968	2182252	375	A	1	I don't know the answer myself.
2182386	2196464	376	A	0.99982	But now when things appear to be a trick and they get you something, maybe there's more to it than what's apparent at first, but I myself don't know the answer.
2196582	2217284	377	A	0.90828	It's a very good question, but I do think it may have to do with the fact that on the one hand, quantum and statistical mechanics both are talking about constraints on information processing, maybe from different perspectives.
2217412	2223130	378	A	0.99994	But again, that's just speculation on my end, so it's maybe a way of relating the two.
2224560	2229950	379	B	0.93148	Could we just review just read Chris's full answer to this.
2230560	2233230	380	B	0.77792	Read the question, and then Chris's full answer.
2235440	2241970	381	A	0.7002	Does the weak rotation to ask that matter energy somehow exists 90 degrees perpendicular to a three dimensional space?
2249620	2251632	382	B	0.99	And then I'll just read Chris's answer.
2251686	2252160	383	B	0.98032	Then anyone?
2252230	2254544	384	B	1	Please raise your hand if you want to add something more on this.
2254582	2260340	385	B	0.58799	He wrote, in a sense, yes, time is perpendicular to our three dimensions of space, matter, and energy.
2260490	2262324	386	B	0.99999	We ourselves exist in time.
2262442	2269672	387	B	0.39194	Wick is pointing to the intimate relationship between how we measure time and how we determine or judge that something maintains its identity through time.
2269726	2270104	388	B	0.93	I e.
2270142	2272120	389	B	0.9995	Stays the same thing through time.
2272270	2278744	390	B	1	To tell time by a clock, I have to be sure I'm looking at the same clock set the same way, et cetera.
2278792	2281420	391	B	0.95142	We'll get to this in July and August.
2287180	2304220	392	B	0.99995	Could you connect this, Andrew, to some of the semantic information flows discussed in Live stream 17 or any of the other cone co cone diagrams from the papers that you showed earlier?
2305920	2306632	393	A	0.5954	Sure.
2306786	2330852	394	A	0.9993	Again, I have to preface it by saying that I am working on understanding it myself, but just from small email exchange that I had with Chris ant waste in this paper, one can sort of see that it's related to the picture I was showing earlier, namely this one.
2330906	2331172	395	A	0.99987	Right.
2331226	2338312	396	A	0.99983	But let's scroll down a little bit to page to page 23 24.
2338446	2340890	397	A	0.48372	Here they talk out with rotation again.
2345500	2368112	398	A	0.7722	So I think it has it has to do with, at least from what I heard from crazy email, has to do with this notion of local time, the definition of local time in this observation picture, and the fact that you rotate 90.
2368166	2373892	399	A	0.49698	Degrees twice, you get the opposite sign, basically, right?
2373946	2390840	400	A	0.94813	So the local time, effectively, that's going to ensure that the picture is symmetric and that the flow is going to be opposite in the direction towards the observer and towards the environment.
2395930	2397234	401	B	0.99871	Okay, Alexey, then.
2397292	2399100	402	B	0.99981	Anyone else raising their hands?
2400190	2412590	403	F	1	I am struggling to understand and part of my difficulty bear with me for being so kind of but I remember Sean Carroll's lecture on time in different versions of physics, and it took a whole hour.
2412660	2415982	404	F	0.90176	So are we talking Newtonian time, which is universally the same?
2416036	2419562	405	F	0.99979	Are we talking relative time philosophically?
2419626	2426610	406	F	0.99998	Are we talking about people who believe that only present here and now is real, while future and past do not exist?
2426950	2434770	407	F	0.94208	So when we say time is perpendicular too, my sense is that just like Chris mentioned in the lecture, we're reinventing the time.
2434840	2439254	408	F	0.99684	We're creating a new definition by calling it the same word we're all familiar with.
2439292	2446438	409	F	1	And that creates some dissonance where I just think that maybe we need to kind of say that this is something new.
2446604	2450314	410	F	0.67	And if it's not something new, then which version of the time are we talking about?
2450352	2452300	411	F	0.77421	Einsteinian, Newtonian or whatever?
2452830	2460620	412	F	0.90573	It's a simple question before we say it's perpendicular, do people agree that future is real or not?
2465950	2467994	413	B	0.87017	I'll give it all on this, Alexey.
2468122	2472240	414	B	0.70827	Again, speculation neither here nor then.
2473750	2497338	415	B	0.99997	If we take Chris seriously, that communication is an ontological primary and that rather than putting communications protocols in some sort of time newtonian time, Einsteinian time, these are these different time concepts, these different scaffolds that then communication gets inscribed within or stretched within.
2497504	2520240	416	B	0.99971	But if we start with a topological understanding of communication rather than a geometric understanding of spacetime so the topology of the blanket and the observer in their sensorium, then different kinds of cognitive agents, ranging from what we would call nonliving to what we could call living.
2521010	2529490	417	B	0.99662	They depending on their cognitive sophistication are able to create or project different time concepts.
2530630	2546390	418	B	0.99996	Time concepts that are not useful will lead to their own material dissolution, the failure to maintain that kind of cognitive sophistication, which requires not just information gathering and utilization, but also energy gathering and utilization.
2547230	2565150	419	B	1	And so when you have multiple agents who are whether you conceptualize them as within a message passing relationship and having no surprise on the clock on the wall, then they're like in a local time synchrony.
2566370	2581170	420	B	1	But the primary case is one entity engaging with its sensorium and itself modeling time in terms of progression.
2582950	2613950	421	B	1	And so these previous time concepts and these different attempts to kind of survey the structure of space time reflect different cognitive models that cognitive agents have proposed for time and that communication actually takes ontological primacy over all of these ramified, potentially overlapping, potentially non overlapping time concepts.
2616050	2622350	422	B	0.99876	But they're downstream of agents cognitive models, not vice versa.
2623270	2629140	423	B	0.70845	I'm not sure it's how I interpreted what Chris said about communication being an ontological primary, though.
2633140	2640870	424	F	0.62663	So if we take one instance of a COVID-19 virus, a single kind of instance, right, it's got no memory and no ability to plan.
2641240	2648560	425	F	0.99999	Is there a local time for that virus versus humanity observing how the virus spreads across the globe?
2648640	2652040	426	F	1	And we have agents with memory and planning.
2653900	2657000	427	F	0.99986	Is there time relative to a single photon?
2659980	2668332	428	F	0.99992	My hunch is that there's a possibility that we're simply inventing something brand new and defining it brand new and they draw in parallel back to all these other times.
2668466	2670190	429	F	1	I understand the effort, but.
2674000	2674524	430	A	0.99967	Is that.
2674562	2675440	431	F	1	A brand new time?
2675510	2676784	432	F	0.99988	Is it some other kind of time?
2676822	2677810	433	F	0.63	I don't know.
2679060	2679596	434	A	0.54803	Daniel.
2679628	2680850	435	A	0.99902	Can I say words?
2681220	2691750	436	A	0.83697	So I understand Alexis question, and I think it's sort of related to, at least morally speaking, to your concern about different kinds of entropy, right?
2693640	2699384	437	A	0.85	And what I can say is that also they have Glazebrook, Marciano and so on.
2699422	2710904	438	A	0.99942	They have this recent paper on quantum error correction, so I have yet to read it and take a closer look.
2710942	2714110	439	A	0.69175	But here they talk about space time, right?
2714720	2737564	440	A	0.98	And my punch to address Alex's question is that if you could sort of recover the more familiar notions of time in a correspondence principle sort of way by taking some Newtonian limit or H bar goes to zero or speed of Glycos infinity and so on, that would be very satisfactory.
2737612	2744612	441	A	0.99836	Sure, they may be doing a new thing, but recovering old stuff in the new thing is a good sanity check.
2744666	2749830	442	A	0.6	And so long as we can see that being worked out, I think I'd be very happy.
2752300	2772840	443	B	0.55	And just to the virus point, I would argue that viruses, through their physical engagement, they do have memory, but they don't necessarily have the awareness or metacognition on that memory, except as granted by intergenerational evolutionary type pressure.
2773000	2782000	444	B	1	But they do have past events modifying them within some set of possibilities.
2783460	2790390	445	B	0.99939	So they're just being them and their internal time.
2791880	2794980	446	B	0.99956	There isn't a cognitive observer necessarily.
2797080	2797444	447	A	0.72267	In.
2797482	2799164	448	B	0.99995	Terms of like a narrative.
2799232	2805050	449	B	0.63	I I am watching the clock, but they do change.
2810360	2813220	450	B	0.99998	But it's certainly very provocative if this is not.
2813290	2822330	451	B	0.82464	Or we could also look to Kronos and Cairos and about the relationship of time and timeliness and agentic time.
2824700	2833580	452	B	1	And then at this point, are we stretching just this one four letter word too far, just like we brought up with information entropy?
2835120	2850850	453	B	0.99999	Can we think about these as kind of like continents and then just if someone said, I visited this continent, you know that you need to specify a lot more, or what granularity are these topics corby and then anyone else raising their hands?
2852760	2853172	454	A	0.84072	Yeah.
2853226	2858896	455	H	0.81339	On this topic, for a Markov blanket, you have a transition matrix.
2859008	2866248	456	H	0.99986	My question is, how are you allowed to increment that transition matrix to calculate a future state?
2866414	2869210	457	H	0.99999	What does that mean in terms of time?
2869980	2876840	458	H	0.99999	Are you only allowed to increment it by the lower bound time, which is h over Ln and kBT.
2878560	2880110	459	H	0.87991	Does that question make sense?
2881920	2884268	460	B	0.78485	I'll give a first pass on this.
2884434	2888680	461	B	0.99996	We have discrete time and continuous time models in Active Inference.
2888840	2897788	462	B	0.52359	For a discrete time model where you have the B transition matrix, then the choice of Delta T is a modeler's decision.
2897884	2906928	463	B	0.79	And we talked about this a lot in live stream 52 on accelerated optimization, there's some Delta T that's like, going to get you the most accelerated optimization.
2907024	2914788	464	B	1	If you have too small of Delta T, then you're either oversampling or you're maybe even physically unrealistic like you pointed to.
2914874	2922980	465	B	1	Or if you have some long Delta T, you're also not making an informative simulation in the discrete time case where you're explicitly making time steps.
2923140	2934936	466	B	0.66923	Contrast with the continuous time generative model, where we're doing more of a Taylor series expansion on the generalized coordinates, at which point Delta T is not required.
2935048	2942610	467	B	0.76174	You're merely just taking an extended approximation from a given snapshot, and so Delta T doesn't even come into play.
2945140	2945664	468	H	0.99998	Got it.
2945702	2947010	469	H	0.89039	Okay, that makes sense.
2948500	2952850	470	H	1	I don't know how it ties into time, but it helps clarify a little bit.
2956760	2957220	471	B	0.99884	Okay.
2957290	2965832	472	B	0.99983	Anyone else can raise their hand or under kind of maybe one more question or one more topic from a paper?
2965886	2978830	473	B	0.9997	Just what's one more puzzle piece that you think gives us a first coat of paint from questions submitted or from one of these papers that you have up?
2980080	2983710	474	B	0.9861	What's something that helps us connect the dots a little bit?
2986640	2987932	475	A	1	I don't think I have a good answer.
2987986	2996260	476	A	0.99997	Let me look at the questions again regarding time.
2996330	3005450	477	A	0.9998	I'll just reiterate what I said as I look over these questions, which is that I believe Chris will address it.
3007740	3019020	478	A	1	I don't know if you can see what I'm sharing on the screen, but the paper, whose title is Communication Protocols blah blah blah from March of this year does talk about spacetime.
3019440	3027976	479	A	0.51565	It's a quantum error correction code, and to me personally, it'd be nice to see if that can be more familiar.
3028008	3035280	480	A	0.99843	Notions of time, such as special relativity can be recovered as limits in correspondence principles.
3039700	3041410	481	A	0.92235	Do you want me to say anything else?
3046210	3051700	482	B	0.99997	If anyone could even just summarize what are these codes referring to?
3052070	3057010	483	B	0.99985	Or how are these codes one and the same as communication protocols?
3058250	3064390	484	B	0.98441	Or are they related to the blanket and the heat that was being output as waste?
3067770	3071340	485	B	0.53322	What will these codes allow us to do better if we understood them more?
3074430	3077100	486	A	1	I don't know that I can answer that right now.
3077870	3080460	487	A	0.99	I don't think they understand the question.
3081870	3083840	488	A	0.99645	Yeah, I just don't know.
3085410	3086160	489	A	0.99973	Sorry.
3092120	3092784	490	B	0.72573	Terry.
3092832	3094870	491	B	0.95	And then anyone else raising their hands.
3097640	3099060	492	C	0.62699	I'm not a physicist.
3099140	3101930	493	C	1	I don't understand maths at all.
3103980	3129164	494	C	0.99903	But what attracted me to this idea of physics as information processing is that it feels like at a base level, whatever the unknowable external state is, it could be perceived as made up of information.
3129362	3148900	495	C	0.54095	You know, we we kind of think of ourselves living in a particulate universe, but at a base level there are these and stop me if I'm just talking 14 year old nonsense here, but this notion of quantum fields, they feel like informational fields.
3149340	3170620	496	C	1	And that the concept of physics is purely information that we then interpret as a physical universe which we inhabit because we can't see beyond our Markov blanket.
3173860	3177856	497	C	0.93	I find this a really exciting idea.
3178038	3178770	498	G	0.89815	That.
3180660	3198000	499	C	0.99991	Whenever you start to think of the surprisal as the variational free energy between sort of your prior and your posterior, if you start to think of that variational free energy, not as energy but as an information gap.
3198080	3209690	500	C	0.99996	So that if you see the energy as actual because energy, when you think of energy in physics terms, it's kind of this magical thing that allows work to happen.
3210800	3211868	501	C	0.99161	But what is it?
3211954	3214350	502	C	0.58197	We've got a term for it.
3216800	3218990	503	C	0.99937	Is it jewels or whatever?
3220240	3221244	504	C	0.99164	But what does it mean?
3221282	3222796	505	C	0.97004	It has this magical property.
3222898	3228112	506	C	0.99999	But if you think of it as information, then it starts to make sense.
3228166	3240180	507	C	0.98166	So variational free energy starts to be seen as a difference in information between your prior and your posterior.
3242040	3251800	508	C	0.99995	So whenever you start to think about time, time is this conceptual metric that we use almost because we have memory.
3253180	3259720	509	C	0.64	And I wonder if we are getting trapped in this semantics.
3260060	3265196	510	C	0.88	And all I have is English because I don't understand the maths really.
3265378	3274952	511	C	0.98068	But you guys come in here and you do understand the maths and then you convert it into English, which I think I understand.
3275106	3282530	512	C	1	And then I can think of it like a kid in a sweetie shop or a physics class at 14 years of age.
3284020	3285660	513	C	1	I don't really know what I'm saying.
3285750	3286852	514	C	0.59	I don't know what I'm saying.
3286906	3295828	515	C	0.99999	But at a fundamental level, everything that we're talking about is I can understand it as information.
3295994	3299304	516	C	0.59	And I'm excited to see how things develop.
3299422	3302040	517	C	0.99999	What are your thoughts on this craziness?
3305100	3308410	518	B	0.99865	So many great pieces in there.
3309820	3313020	519	B	0.99988	Physics as information processing.
3313680	3319710	520	B	0.99999	What is it that actually allows the steam engine to run and the ball to move?
3320320	3321980	521	B	0.99999	That kind of physics.
3322480	3336690	522	B	0.72	And then as the timeline laid out, also occurring during a period of immense technology and apparatus development and digitization and all of this and unconventional computing as well.
3337540	3353450	523	B	0.76356	It's almost like this materialist dualism that instead of with mind and body that there was some kind of dualism between the types of forces and energies and ways of thinking about what made the steam engine work and then what makes a computer work.
3354380	3365352	524	B	1	And so you'd understand how the computer could fall off a cliff, but then you wouldn't necessarily be able to use that exact kind of mechanics and physics and dynamics to study like how the computer operated.
3365496	3367900	525	B	0.78919	But you could say it weighed eleven pounds.
3368240	3380128	526	B	1	And so I think the provocation, which is as you hinted towards first off, would be awesome to have a natural language math and graphical synthesis the triple play.
3380294	3399620	527	B	1	But also then to use a common approach to understanding this and what wasn't working or is not proposed to work, is trying to fit information into that non cognitive universe.
3400220	3415550	528	B	1	But rather if we take the cognitive primacy of communication, then all of these forces as inferred by the sensorium, which is all we're ever going to have, totally the most valid first principles constraint to make.
3416000	3432370	529	B	0.99967	Maybe then we'll be able to have a lot more synthesis about even how steam engines work when we understand that we're bound in that inference by our sensorium and all that comes along with that and the variational free energy bounding surprise on our generative model.
3434180	3435040	530	B	0.99583	Dean.
3439620	3448276	531	G	0.98617	I'm going to come at this from the position of a 14 year old lens because I don't think there's anything unique about that.
3448458	3460708	532	G	1	I think on the most basic level, what I took away from Chris's lecture was that there's information processing of at least two types.
3460884	3474876	533	G	1	One is figuring it out, as in figure five or any of these other figures that are up on the screen right now, or anything that stabilizes the world around us.
3474978	3480716	534	G	1	I think examples have come up in this conversation already of topology or geometry.
3480908	3487848	535	G	0.99998	There's a second type of information processing which is outing the figure type of information which is searching.
3488044	3493716	536	G	1	And I think Alexey used the expression which time are we talking about?
3493898	3496532	537	G	0.99995	So these two types of processes are quite different.
3496586	3512910	538	G	0.93463	If you do a comparative analysis of the two, you have information practicing and you have to have both of the processes to really get a sense conceptually of what it is that communication is really talking about.
3513440	3528896	539	G	0.99999	If you are information practicing your wayfinding until you collapse to something we might describe in a verb tense as way found it's in the quantizing of that invariant state, that vast ocean, if you want to think of it.
3528918	3559140	540	G	0.97844	Metaphorically out to all horizons on the manifold into a variant or a nuanced or a discretized or an orientation type of state where all of a sudden things like currents and temperature shifts and even things that we've applied labels to, like entropy and a transition matrix suddenly appear out of the seeming nothingness or the invariance.
3559300	3567740	541	G	0.99698	So that's not the math, but that's kind of stepping back and saying what is the math trying to say?
3567890	3571180	542	G	0.93	I think it boils down to the comparative analysis.
3571920	3585164	543	G	1	And then I'm hoping that in the coming lectures, chris starts opening that up and doing kind of the back and forth between the two types of figuring it out and outing the figures.
3585212	3593270	544	G	1	Because I think when both are part of the conversation, that's when we start to get a sense of what's really going on.
3601340	3602376	545	B	0.99995	Thank you.
3602558	3616460	546	B	0.99889	In this sort of closing sessions, especially if anyone hasn't added anything, please feel free to give any last reflections or questions arising.
3617120	3623650	547	B	0.9979	So first, as many people as would like can reflect that way.
3624740	3634084	548	B	1	And then after every hand has been addressed, then ander if you could just give us a kind of look ahead.
3634202	3643540	549	B	0.99978	So Avel first, then Anyone else with just where does this discussion take us and where do you want to continue to learn more about Avel?
3645740	3647128	550	D	0.94007	So, two things.
3647214	3653960	551	D	1	First, if I walk out of here without understanding what is coconut, I will be disappointed.
3655760	3660684	552	D	0.58	And I don't actually expect it to happen in like 12 hours.
3660802	3662476	553	D	0.99988	That seems like it's something.
3662658	3687140	554	D	0.9993	But more seriously, I can agree with that difficulty that there is a unity between physical structure and communication protocols and that communication protocols are quantum reference frame, kind of individuate physical states, individuate meaningful measurement outcomes that are ray file as physical possibilities.
3687480	3694388	555	D	0.5686	But the question is then where do communication protocols, quantum merchants frame come from?
3694554	3699976	556	D	0.5324	Like, what are the physical determinants that bring about those things?
3700158	3705496	557	D	1	And that seems like a question that could be addressed at the conceptual level of this course.
3705598	3712830	558	D	1	And I would like I saw the live stream 17, so that did not help.
3713440	3722972	559	D	0.99808	Anyway, I would like to have more grip into that if we can address it in the foreign courses.
3723036	3723810	560	A	0.99913	Thank you.
3725220	3726210	561	B	0.99933	Thank you.
3730020	3730844	562	B	0.62094	Anyone else?
3730902	3738470	563	B	0.99948	Especially if they haven't added anything yet, want to give kind of a closing thought?
3751310	3757434	564	B	0.9313	Yeah, there's a lot to learn and Chris brings up a lot in his lecture, even though we've only had one.
3757472	3765280	565	B	0.98845	It's one of the denser hours of epistemic resourcing that I've seen.
3765810	3771870	566	B	1	And there's also all of these accessory and cutting edge works that under showing.
3772690	3785742	567	B	0.99844	So I'm really looking forward to how we can continue to curate and improve the questions that we have so that the uncertainties in our generative model that we have, how would this be useful?
3785806	3786710	568	B	1	What does this mean?
3786780	3788486	569	B	0.99999	Why is this variable this way?
3788588	3790310	570	B	0.99999	What is the implication for that?
3790460	3805530	571	B	0.9999	Those are all the great questions and let's just get them inscribed on our classical documents so that we can have other quantum cognitive agents reduce their uncertainty by looking at the responses.
3806590	3817440	572	B	0.9996	So with that under, if you could just look ahead to lecture two and just point towards where we're going to be going.
3821230	3834474	573	A	0.99995	Yes, lecture two will, I think from what I hear from Chris, is going to start to address these basic ontological aspects of the quantum measurement.
3834602	3847020	574	A	0.69267	So the two sources to look at would be two papers, mainly this one, Physical Meaning of Holographic Principle.
3847520	3850172	575	A	0.99992	This one's, by far the most pedagogical one.
3850226	3854800	576	A	0.98062	So if I had to suggest that books look at one, it would be this one.
3854870	3872816	577	A	0.81499	It's very easy to read, I think, but maybe for a bit more detail there's the slightly older one and they talk at length about Cocoa and the headgrounds here, Free Energy Principle for Generic Content Systems.
3873008	3876452	578	A	0.99553	So I think that's what's going to come in these two lectures.
3876516	3883370	579	A	0.99959	Basically, the main ideas behind these two papers and yeah, that's all I have to say.
3886140	3891900	580	B	0.82287	All right, well, thank you for all who joined this first discussion.
3892240	3896700	581	B	0.83611	Hope that it was fun for you and for the audience.
3897200	3903708	582	B	1	And check out the course site for the readings to get ahead of the second lecture.
3903804	3913100	583	B	0.99499	We'll all watch the second lecture and come back in about a month for the second discussion.
3913180	3917504	584	B	0.99641	Everyone's welcome to join, and the website has the registration information.
3917702	3927220	585	B	0.5	And so now that we've seen a little bit of one way, it can be we may do something similar or we may do something different for the second discussion.
3927380	3929368	586	B	0.99652	So thanks again, everybody.
3929534	3930570	587	B	0.85465	See you later.
3930940	3931300	588	A	0.39243	Bye.
