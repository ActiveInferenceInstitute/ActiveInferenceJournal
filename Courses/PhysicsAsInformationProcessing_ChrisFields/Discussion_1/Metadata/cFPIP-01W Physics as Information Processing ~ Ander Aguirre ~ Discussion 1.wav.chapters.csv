3480	126290	00:03	First discussion section for Physics as information processing course with Chris Fields. In this first interval, we're going to go to anyone who raises their hand. How has their background and journey led to them joining? What are they hoping to learn and do in this course?	First discussion section for Physics as information processing course with Chris Fields	Participatory Discussion section

Evel blue wants to formalize participatorialism, the idea that observer participates in creating reality. I'm enjoying this course a great deal.	Ross first, Alexi second, Evelinaka third	At the Cognitive Science Festival
296700	363452	04:56	Blue Knight: I'm with the active inference institute. I'm super interested in the aspect of spacetime arising from communication. How it connects to the Buddhist and maybe more Eastern religion concept of dependent arising.	Blue Knight is interested in spacetime arising from communication	Active Inference and the Buddhist concept
363506	537284	06:03	Daniel Chow started a PhD in artificial intelligence in an 8th application in the educational field. Corby's background is in quantum engineering. Feel free to raise your hand anytime you'd like to jump into the stack.	Daniel Chow: I'm excited about all the science based implications of this lecture	An introduction to the First Principles
537402	859390	08:57	Chris Crease: There are many hands coming from different directions, pointing at the same thing. He says information will have a central aspect in physics in the future, but also possibly biology. Could you reflect on lecture one?	Chris Crease says that information will have central role in physics in future	The importance of information in physics

I think we may need to be careful because we are just ignoring the differences in assumptions. But I do think it's a balancing act and there's no way to not have simplification and generalization.	People take a term like entropy and run with it	In the Elevator: Different Views on Entropy
978660	1413484	16:18	Alexi: What do you see as the fundamental differences in different descriptions of entropy. Do you think there is some general concept that could be extracted from all of them? Ollie: We need to be more specific about what exactly we mean by entropy and information.	Alexi: There are many different conceptions of entropy. For example, when we talk about active inference	Different Definitions of Entropy
1413682	1498250	23:33	We've been able to get 13 answered by Chris so far. The questions and answers are going to be part of what is published by the Octemf Journal. We really encourage basic questions, advanced questions, just there's no question that doesn't make sense to submit.	Andre: We appreciate the submitted questions. We've been able to get 13 answered so far	13 questions submitted for Chris's response to the Octemf Journal
1498700	1838720	24:58	What is time? This is partially addressed. There's different notions of entropy. Is there any work on the frequency or the rate at which one could read and write information on the boundary?	What is time and what is entropy? This is partially addressed	What is Time and Entropy?
1841300	2132750	30:41	Andre: Is this a schematic or a map of how we could think about something occurring? The observer effect is the notion that you cannot observe something without disturbing the environment. Daniel: Pick another question, or anyone raising their hand, or if anyone in the live chat wants to write something, I'll read it.	Andre, a few questions on this figure. What is happening internal to the agent here? What kind of computation is happening	Quantum information processing and the observer effect
2133840	2399100	35:33	The Wick rotation takes you from quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics. Could you connect this to some of the semantic information flows discussed in Live stream 17? We'll get to this in July and August.	The Wick rotation takes you from quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics, roughly speaking	Wick's rotation
2400190	2853172	40:00	Daniel: When we say time is perpendicular too, my sense is that just like Chris mentioned in the lecture, we're reinventing the time. Different kinds of cognitive agents, ranging from what we would call nonliving to what we could call living, can create or project different time concepts. Is that a brand new time? Is it some other kind of time?	Alexey: When we say time is perpendicular, does anyone agree it's real	We're Not Reventing Time
2853226	2952850	47:33	We have discrete time and continuous time models in active inference. For a discrete time model where you have the B transition matrix, then the choice of Delta T is a modeler's decision. Contrast with the continuous time generative model, where we're doing more of a Taylor series expansion on the generalized coordinates.

2956760	3602376	49:16	 Physics as information processing. Notions of time, such as special relativity can be recovered as limits in correspondence principles. It would be awesome to have a natural language and graphical synthesis to understand this. What are your thoughts on this craziness?	Terry: Physics as information processing is an exciting idea	Quantum Computations: Information Processing
3602558	3805530	1:00:02	In this sort of closing sessions, especially if anyone hasn't added anything, please feel free to give any last reflections or questions arising. There's a lot to learn and Chris brings up a lot in his lecture. I'm really looking forward to how we can continue to curate and improve the questions that we have.	In this sort of closing sessions, especially if anyone hasn't added anything, please feel free to	Avel: Closing Statements
3806590	3931300	1:03:26	Lecture two will address basic ontological aspects of the quantum measurement. The two sources to look at would be two papers, mainly this one, Physical Meaning of Holographic Principle. Check out the course site for the readings to get ahead of the second lecture.	Lecture two will address basic ontological aspects of quantum measurement	Quantum measurement: The ontological aspects
