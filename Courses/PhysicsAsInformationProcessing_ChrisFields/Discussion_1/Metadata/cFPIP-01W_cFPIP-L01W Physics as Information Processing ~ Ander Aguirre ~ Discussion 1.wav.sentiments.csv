3480	4030	A	0.546256959438324	You.
6000	7676	B	0.9103710651397705	Hello and welcome, everyone.
7858	10364	B	0.8545258641242981	It's June 3, 2023.
10482	16584	B	0.9322725534439087	We're in the first discussion section for Physics as information processing course with Chris Fields.
16712	20872	B	0.9722868204116821	So welcome to all who are here on and off camera.
20936	26904	B	0.9880384802818298	Really exciting to see so many people joining for this participatory discussion section.
27032	41588	B	0.9660829305648804	So in this first interval, we're going to go to anyone who raises their hand, and it would be awesome to hear from everyone who would like to share what excites them about what they heard in the first lecture.
41764	47348	B	0.9136249423027039	How has their background and journey led to them joining?
47444	53770	B	0.9053080677986145	What are they hoping to learn and do in this course?
54300	60060	B	0.7069470882415771	So firsthand we'll get to go, maybe.
60130	63880	B	0.7346090078353882	Ander you can actually start first, just speaking as a normal participant.
63960	66850	B	0.5762268900871277	And then meanwhile, anyone is welcome to raise their hands.
67540	68384	A	0.9681620597839355	That sounds good.
68422	78836	A	0.5368492603302002	So I am a mathematician by training, but I've always been interested in the more physics side of things.
79018	88180	A	0.7632933855056763	And in particular, I followed Chris's work pretty closely since probably 2019.
91580	96490	A	0.5571835041046143	I'm just very interested in the whole ontology of quantum measurement, what it means.
97020	102890	A	0.5887908339500427	I feel like very often when it's taught in physics classes, it's hand waved away.
103260	119244	A	0.7744147181510925	And even though I myself subscribe to the philosophy of shut up and compute, sometimes not everything you need to do a little bit of philosophy, maybe, and this may be one of the things where you need to do it and you need to address it from first principles.
119292	119456	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
119478	120928	A	0.7876535058021545	And I think Chris is doing that.
121014	123712	A	0.6004069447517395	So I'm just here to learn more.
123846	126290	A	0.586337149143219	And yeah, that's basically it.
127700	128220	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
128310	133270	B	0.8264208436012268	I'll just go from the top left because I'm not necessarily watching, like, what order, but Ross first.
135960	136710	A	0.5325649380683899	Hi.
138360	163580	C	0.780229389667511	I'm interested in the kind of overlap between cognitive science and physics and seeing if there are any panpsychist implications of the observation that physical processes seem to follow the same kind of principle that we see applied to brains and cognitive systems.
166560	167080	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
167170	168480	B	0.8626253604888916	Thank you, Abel.
171540	172096	D	0.5325649380683899	Hi.
172198	174160	D	0.7722822427749634	I'm avelinaka.
174980	182192	D	0.8282016515731812	I have mixed backgrounds, mostly physics and cognitive science.
182256	187712	D	0.538001537322998	Right now, I could be qualified as a philosopher of physics and cognitive science.
187856	197480	D	0.4981532692909241	And I'm interested in basically formalizing participatorialism, the idea that observer participates in creating reality.
197820	204036	D	0.8855367302894592	I did some work in formalizing that in the case of social norms and things like language.
204228	212780	D	0.8064895272254944	And I met a block based on my lack of knowledge of quantum physics and the mathematical tools that I used for that.
212850	217180	D	0.8536807894706726	So I'm here in a course to get those formal skills.
219300	219856	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
219958	220384	B	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
220422	221680	B	0.7623701691627502	Evel blue.
224660	226530	E	0.8586323261260986	I think Alex was first.
227140	229104	B	0.5877124667167664	Okay, Alexi, go for it.
229302	230050	A	0.509212851524353	Sorry.
230500	231640	F	0.7110002040863037	Hi, I'm Alexey.
231660	233632	F	0.9021312594413757	I'm a clinical psychologist in Maryland.
233696	234308	F	0.7195508480072021	In the States.
234394	237264	F	0.8880963921546936	I work with patients, do psychotherapy mostly.
237392	252440	F	0.720696210861206	My interest came through Mark Solms, who is the creator and leader of neuropsychoanalysis, and he has been collaborating with Kristen on heart problem of consciousness, and he's now working on AI with emotions.
254620	255464	F	0.7439884543418884	I blame him.
255502	262424	F	0.7816701531410217	I say it with respect and love that for introducing mathematics into our field, which was mostly devoid of mathematics.
262472	267740	F	0.7145009636878967	And people started looking at these partial differential equations and mark of blankets.
267900	278140	F	0.8449349403381348	So I wrote a paper about a possible extension of their model to include chaos theory and I just want to understand deeper concepts involved.
278220	280944	F	0.5542498826980591	I have some understanding of them, but perhaps not enough.
280982	283090	F	0.9873910546302795	And I'm enjoying this course a great deal.
283480	291888	F	0.9894225001335144	I think Chris, among other things, is a fantastic teacher and he is able to express things very clearly and I have goosebumps.
291904	295130	F	0.989866316318512	So I'm very grateful to everybody and thank you so much.
296700	297256	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
297358	298072	B	0.7348847389221191	Blue then.
298126	301368	B	0.7218160629272461	Francesco hi, everyone.
301454	302404	E	0.7758106589317322	I'm Blue Knight.
302452	304656	E	0.899357795715332	I'm with the active inference institute.
304708	314924	E	0.8456993699073792	So I've been tracking this work of Chris's connecting quantum information and active inference for, I don't know, a couple of years now.
315042	325292	E	0.937818706035614	Through that thread, I'm super interested actually in the aspect of spacetime arising from communication.
325356	343400	E	0.8313312530517578	I think that that's like fascinating to dive into and how it connects to the Buddhist and maybe more Eastern religion concept of dependent arising, like how the interdependence of all things leads to their existence.
344540	345412	E	0.7146663069725037	From that aspect.
345476	355212	E	0.6098442077636719	I think that's what I'm most interested in exploring my background is neuroscience, but I've also been studying practicing Buddhism for like 25 years.
355346	357292	E	0.5665727257728577	So yeah, that's it.
357346	357950	G	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
359600	360060	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
360130	361020	B	0.7235091328620911	Francesca then.
361090	363452	B	0.5170743465423584	Corby thanks.
363506	364460	G	0.80415940284729	Daniel Chow, everyone.
364530	365804	G	0.9902751445770264	Super happy to be here.
365922	371148	G	0.8456935882568359	I also have a mixed background because I studied cognitive anthropology and philosophy of science.
371244	379056	G	0.7440922856330872	And currently a few months ago I started a PhD in artificial intelligence in an 8th application in the educational field.
379238	388976	G	0.9908621311187744	And yes, I'm actually super excited about all the science based implications that Chris Fields mentioned in the first lecture.
389088	400808	G	0.9523895382881165	The connection I have no background in physics, but the connections between the first principles, physics and free energy principle and scientific cognition in general is what is really getting me excited in these days.
400974	401930	A	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
404620	405224	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
405342	406156	B	0.6541419625282288	Corby then.
406178	408190	B	0.8832942247390747	Anyone else who raises their hand?
410320	411916	H	0.9805731177330017	Yeah, great to be here.
412018	414856	H	0.8218995928764343	My background is in quantum engineering.
415048	419404	H	0.6789258718490601	I've always been motivated by figuring out what the next big thing in computing was.
419442	428912	H	0.671140730381012	In high school, Morris Law was sort of coming to an end and it seemed like a really big opportunity to figure out what the next big computing architecture might be.
428966	434672	H	0.7779216766357422	So I did academic research in neuromorphic computing, quantum computing and quantum sensors.
434736	438292	H	0.8244784474372864	And I felt like I was a little bit too early for all of those things.
438346	444616	H	0.6246752142906189	So I went into cloud and cloud gaming and streaming AI services.
444798	450132	H	0.8539057374000549	But I'm still extremely motivated to figure out what the next big thing is in the Holographic principle.
450196	452884	H	0.9247530698776245	Seems like a good foundation to explore.
452932	453530	A	0.5773851871490479	That.
457250	458000	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
458370	459934	B	0.7969779968261719	I'll raise my own hand then.
459972	462142	B	0.7788662314414978	Anyone else is welcome to go.
462276	463550	B	0.7875402569770813	So, I'm Daniel.
463970	475742	B	0.8205709457397461	I'm a researcher at the institute and have known ander for some years and learned about all kinds of Stochastic matrices and how the math and the quantum were linked.
475886	481294	B	0.524769127368927	And we had talked and joked about learning from Chris Fields for a long time.
481432	499260	B	0.9438923001289368	So when the opportunity arose to enact it and extend it and open it, we were very excited and also don't have much of a formal background in physics outside of working with Yaaka bin Ali on Live stream 49.
501310	506780	B	0.9620687961578369	So it's just going to be a great time to learn and see where it all goes.
511010	516590	B	0.882904052734375	Anyone else want to say hello in this kind of opening section?
523700	537284	B	0.5016986727714539	Okay, well, continuing forward, of course, please just feel free to raise your hand anytime you'd like to jump into the stack, Andre, for several minutes or however you see.
537402	542390	B	0.906529426574707	Could you reflect on lecture one?
543080	545670	B	0.8673966526985168	Where did Chris enter?
546040	547344	B	0.8350012302398682	How did he proceed?
547392	550170	B	0.8637233972549438	And where did the lecture take us?
553660	554650	B	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
555100	555896	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
556078	558760	B	0.8845380544662476	Can you zoom in a little bit more on the PDF?
561440	562380	A	0.8097810745239258	Can you hear me?
562450	563036	B	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
563138	564060	B	0.4859412908554077	Go for it.
564210	567212	A	0.9077338576316833	Let's take a look at the slides from last time.
567346	583520	A	0.8273773193359375	So I think if we were to summarize this whole lecture, basically what Chris was trying to say is that there are many hands coming from different directions, pointing at the same thing, right?
583590	595364	A	0.8440423607826233	Pointing at the fact that information will have a central aspect in physics in the future, but also possibly biology, right?
595402	607112	A	0.8623077869415283	So the earliest hints came from statistical mechanics, if you wish, but also quantum mechanics, right?
607166	614700	A	0.8289783596992493	And here we need to make an important but subtle distinction between what it is, the uncertainty principle, right?
614770	618636	A	0.823591411113739	Because we think of that as the informational part, right?
618658	624720	A	0.7974192500114441	Like a limit on the resolution on information and what is the observer effect.
624870	626624	A	0.8262868523597717	Just to make that distinction clear.
626742	630464	A	0.8619353175163269	I think Chris is talking about the observer effect.
630662	638768	A	0.795847475528717	The uncertainty principle is an artifact of the wave nature of quantum mechanics, right?
638934	643664	A	0.8291476964950562	You can get it from properties of the Fourier transform, cautious words, inequality.
643792	647444	A	0.8049566149711609	But at the end of the day, it's what I was saying earlier, right?
647642	650984	A	0.836786150932312	What is the basic picture of measurement, right?
651022	656650	A	0.8721477389335632	And that's sort of what Crease with Glazebrook and Marciana is trying to address.
657260	666060	A	0.892118513584137	And the first two hints came from quantum mechanics around 1900 and statistical mechanics a few decades earlier.
666640	670124	A	0.7324334979057312	Then there's more stuff, right?
670162	690016	A	0.6236563324928284	Like, obviously physicists resisted to inertia of hundreds of years of a totally objective, observer independent universe, but the hints continued to pile on some stuff coming from math.
690128	704680	A	0.8192474246025085	But perhaps the most interesting is, again, how all those paradoxes from statistical mechanics were made sense of with Landauers proposal.
705180	715012	A	0.6432669758796692	And then as physics got more fancy past QFT and stuff, people started thinking about quantum information more seriously.
715076	720990	A	0.8639253377914429	So we had Bell Serum and all these proposals by Deutsche and Wheeler and so on.
721680	726780	A	0.6051118969917297	And I should say that this is not a fringe idea in physics.
727200	730572	A	0.6866441369056702	The paradigm of it from qubit is very much mainstream.
730636	732000	A	0.7281592488288879	I mean, Google it.
732070	735056	A	0.8213562369346619	A lot of physicists think about it.
735158	737556	A	0.5897602438926697	I don't know how many of them talk about it.
737578	746420	A	0.8828808665275574	Openly, but it's been a widespread folk intuition, so to speak, that information will have this sort of central role.
747080	756024	A	0.8908652067184448	And the last sort of hints pointing in that direction of information having a central law came on the one side from high energy stuff.
756142	758904	A	0.8164957761764526	And that's what the Holographic principle is.
759102	770568	A	0.8978055715560913	It originally arose in the context of black hole thermodynamics, but then it was extended to what's called the Ads CFT correspondence.
770664	778690	A	0.8861284852027893	And the very most recent stuff was basically one side from high energy stuff.
779540	782988	A	0.6202529668807983	Sorry, I can speak a little more loudly.
783164	783904	B	0.8811412453651428	It's all good.
783942	784288	B	0.6862502694129944	Continue.
784374	785120	B	0.49556341767311096	Honor.
785620	787396	A	0.6697272658348083	Yeah, I thought there was a question.
787578	788608	B	0.5580718517303467	Someone was just unmuted.
788624	789508	B	0.8811412453651428	It's all good.
789674	790390	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
791000	791604	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
791722	793430	A	0.7716222405433655	So that's basically it, right?
794680	804664	A	0.5490760803222656	There's hints from many directions, and most recently the work of Friston and Levin coming from biology, all pointing in the same direction, right.
804702	817800	A	0.8684698939323425	That we might have to make sense of some sort of eventually scale free information processing per data for what it means to be an observer.
819280	821528	A	0.8338983654975891	All of these things are pointing in that direction.
821624	824812	A	0.520592987537384	And I think Chris's work is addressing that head on.
824866	825372	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
825506	836210	A	0.6321231722831726	As I said earlier, sometimes it's good to do computations, but sometimes you need to take a step back and think more philosophically about what you're doing and what the bigger picture is.
839960	845716	A	0.7683088183403015	And then maybe after people talk a little bit, we can warm up to the second lecture.
845908	851370	A	0.8804174661636353	The other windows that I have open here, some of them are the papers that are to come.
853600	854300	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
854450	854812	A	0.6896663904190063	Anyone?
854866	857676	B	0.5538269281387329	Please feel free to raise your hand on this.
857698	859390	B	0.8593001961708069	Alexey and then anyone else?
861760	869372	F	0.8627643585205078	I had one thought about this thing when you mentioned that there's various perspectives on the same concept.
869436	871164	F	0.7697040438652039	And I'm trying to be cautious.
871212	880272	F	0.9724675416946411	On the one hand, I think, again, this amazing clarity and precision with which Chris expressed thoughts is fantastic and enjoyable.
880336	883680	F	0.7454842329025269	On the other hand, it requires simplification and generalization.
883760	888916	F	0.6173528432846069	And what I observe in my field is people take a term like entropy and run with it.
889018	894276	F	0.7993636131286621	And then they get very quickly from thermodynamic entropy to Shannon to whatever entropy.
894308	897752	F	0.49230721592903137	And they talk about sort of and that's not the case.
897806	904424	F	0.8604687452316284	I mean, if we go back to Klausius and all the others, there was a system of postulates and axioms that must be maintained.
904552	908776	F	0.8373944163322449	And if you step outside of that so, like us organisms, we're open systems.
908808	909944	F	0.6907835006713867	We're not closed systems.
909992	911656	F	0.618370771408081	So we should not apply directly.
911688	919600	F	0.617465078830719	Second law thermodynamics and I deal a little more with comogorphs and eye entropy, which is not the same thing.
919750	936368	F	0.5078270435333252	And I guess when we very quickly move from sort of thermodynamics to statistical mechanics with Boltzman to all the way around and we assume it is the same thing, I think we may need to be careful because we are just ignoring the differences in assumptions.
936544	938716	F	0.8849104046821594	Shannon talked about telegraph.
938768	942792	F	0.8050209879875183	He talked about a receiver getting a message from a sender, right?
942926	946760	F	0.7332954406738281	And Clausius talked about gas.
948460	953412	F	0.6898369789123535	But I do think it's a balancing act and there's no way to not have simplification and generalization.
953476	961688	F	0.7361823320388794	I just wanted to say somewhere, somehow we need to kind of go back there and just say entropy is not entropy is not entropy.
961784	965810	F	0.6897096037864685	And all these things are kind of long papers, right?
978660	979120	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
979190	982210	B	0.8931118249893188	Yakub, then Ali, then anyone else?
987240	1014590	A	0.8843819499015808	I just wanted to ask for, I guess perhaps slightly longer comment from Alexi on what you see as the fundamental differences in different descriptions of entropy and whether there is some general concept that could be extracted from all of them, such as level of information or uncertainty about a particular system.
1014960	1038530	A	0.7407310605049133	Even though these specific formulations of entropy, they talk about, they were derived from different specific systems and they have different equations describing them and they mean slightly different things, do you think it would be wrong to say that there is some commonality between them?
1042410	1044860	F	0.854944109916687	Should I answer Daniel or yeah, please.
1046030	1052774	F	0.7120080590248108	I don't know, I just think we need to at some point formalize it and be careful with these generalizations.
1052822	1057166	F	0.8688530921936035	For example, when we talk about active inference and Kristen right.
1057348	1062394	F	0.6203044652938843	When we say living organisms must minimize I'm quoting Kristen, by the way, these are not my thoughts.
1062522	1065438	F	0.7487876415252686	The entropy of sensory states, right?
1065604	1071918	F	0.49982404708862305	And then people take that idea sometimes and generalize and they say that that's what life is, minimization of entropy.
1071934	1072402	F	0.7360090017318726	Right?
1072536	1080200	F	0.6282314658164978	But if you actually look into human brain and measure entropy, then it goes all over the place, up, down and in between.
1080730	1084082	F	0.8361181616783142	And so I don't think that's an accurate description.
1084146	1087890	F	0.8280665278434753	And the reason for that is where we shifted away from the assumptions.
1087970	1103078	F	0.8351487517356873	And again, so comagorfsini entropy talks about the phase space and the divergence of trajectories in phase space and sort of the volume and face space, while when you talk about this Briston's entropy of sensory states, these are probability distributions.
1103254	1109546	F	0.7902420163154602	And Shannon talked about the uncertainty of the receiver, about the message sent by the sender.
1109658	1113086	F	0.8287861347198486	So if you want to extract the same thing, I suppose you can.
1113188	1119042	F	0.8285079598426819	But it's important not to lose at least the difference between what kind of object are we applying to?
1119096	1121134	F	0.889168918132782	Are we looking at probability distributions?
1121182	1122402	F	0.9097052812576294	Are we looking at phase space?
1122456	1124078	F	0.8731916546821594	Are we looking at ideal gas?
1124174	1125122	F	0.8372961282730103	Where are we at?
1125176	1129298	F	0.5379356741905212	And we're just not to say entropy is entropy is entropy.
1129314	1130310	F	0.5108771324157715	That's not the case.
1130460	1136920	F	0.797356128692627	It's just a formula, but depending on the context, assumptions and things, it can be very different.
1142870	1144206	B	0.7798569798469543	Thanks, Ollie.
1144318	1145490	B	0.7302706837654114	And Ava.
1147990	1148450	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
1148520	1169894	I	0.7954004406929016	In regard to Alex's comments, I just wanted to mention the research of people like Rudolph Hannel and Stefan Surger, because for many years they've been exploring this idea of different conceptions of entropy and they've come up with at least a dozen different meanings for entropy.
1169942	1201410	I	0.8311684727668762	And they've formulated it in a kind of generalized framework, but at the same time, they've also devised a way to somehow classify them into equivalence classes and to see whether one or more of those conceptions of entropy can be theoretically derived from some others or they're totally distinct and different conceptions of entropy.
1201490	1210540	I	0.7803418636322021	So, yes, I agree that in some situations, we need to be more specific about what exactly we mean by entropy and information.
1212190	1216940	I	0.8587357997894287	I mean, based on the question or the situation of interest.
1219230	1220570	B	0.6870638132095337	Thanks, Avil.
1223870	1229754	D	0.6666355133056641	So, just to vote in the entropy discussion, I want to emphasize that entropy is PLNP.
1229802	1241380	D	0.836894154548645	So it's a function of probability distribution, which is I think I'm not sure what the term is in English, but it's a measure of how big something is in a space.
1241830	1244754	D	0.7944108843803406	And to get that, you have to define a space.
1244872	1249254	D	0.5946447253227234	And in many case, it's pretty arbitrary to decide what the space you're looking at is.
1249372	1258310	D	0.7439677715301514	For example, you talk I don't know if it was Alexa, someone talked about entropy of fMRI.
1258810	1262422	D	0.8646289706230164	Well, those are aggregate measurements of general activity.
1262486	1266054	D	0.501187801361084	This is not the space of all possible configuration.
1266182	1282660	D	0.6977401971817017	And even if I add something like the space of all, let's say, functional configuration, the state in neuron that reflect activity, this would be another thing than the space of atomic configuration, where the specific atom are.
1285510	1291540	D	0.5736910700798035	You don't have a warranty that when you define entropy, you define it on a meaningful space that's not given.
1295350	1300210	D	0.6482381820678711	I kind of think there is one entropy and that's it, and it's an info construct.
1300370	1306002	D	0.8549656271934509	But also we have to if we agree to that, then it entails that we have to find it.
1306076	1309180	D	0.8183203339576721	It's not just given out there in the data.
1323880	1336088	B	0.7184033393859863	Well, certainly being precise in the formalism and in natural language for what we mean by information and entropy and all these terms is pretty important.
1336174	1340220	B	0.8293997645378113	I mean, the course we're in is physics as information processing.
1340880	1361440	B	0.5304534435272217	But without an understanding of how information is being meant here or what measurements and transformations were performing what informational operations, then it is a non sequitur.
1361780	1378810	B	0.8974497318267822	So how do we go about clarifying or understanding what kinds of theoretical results in a given domain or, like, what is shown on the timeline here might apply to some other area?
1383190	1384500	B	0.7819783687591553	Just one thought.
1385270	1390820	B	0.8137466311454773	Anyone else can raise their hand with a thought or a question.
1391670	1400200	B	0.8803654313087463	Otherwise honor, you can maybe flip over to select a few of the submitted questions.
1403710	1404362	B	0.84200119972229	Cool.
1404496	1408220	B	0.8834117650985718	Could you zoom in with control plus a fair amount?
1412640	1413484	B	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
1413682	1417628	B	0.9500994086265564	So, everyone, we really appreciate the submitted questions.
1417714	1422210	B	0.6209843158721924	We've been able to get 13 answered by Chris so far.
1422820	1431824	B	0.9205938577651978	And as with the transcripts of the discussions and lectures, the questions and answers are going to be part of what is published by the Octemf Journal.
1431952	1442336	B	0.495192289352417	So we really encourage basic questions, advanced questions, just there's no question that doesn't make sense to submit.
1442528	1455130	B	0.5442792177200317	So, Andre, maybe just pick one question that you think is interesting to begin with and summarize Chris's response, and then everyone else is welcome to kind of add some other thoughts on this.
1456700	1459976	A	0.8657001852989197	So, I'm going to scroll up and down just to sort of sample.
1460168	1461884	A	0.837603747844696	Let me start with the first two.
1462002	1462716	A	0.8097810745239258	Can you hear me?
1462738	1463068	A	0.6651440858840942	Well?
1463154	1468172	A	0.870785117149353	Yes, since perhaps I think you submitted this as a trial, right?
1468306	1469068	A	0.7965733408927917	Is that right?
1469154	1469836	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1470018	1471148	A	0.785323977470398	So what is information?
1471234	1472270	A	0.7286242246627808	What is time?
1473920	1475228	A	0.8885973691940308	Here is Chris's response.
1475244	1477568	A	0.7608011364936829	I guess everyone has a chance to look at it.
1477654	1492916	A	0.5587726831436157	Now, if I am to summarize this, the one thing I've heard that personally, the one I like the most, answer, at least as an Adash, to summarize it, is that information are differences that make a difference.
1493018	1495384	A	0.8222959041595459	This I might have heard from Chris, I might have heard from someone else.
1495422	1496504	A	0.6349968314170837	I don't remember.
1496702	1498250	A	0.6870211362838745	But that's one thing.
1498700	1507820	A	0.8696659207344055	Now, onto the question of what is time, and I guess this also addresses Alex's question of what is entropy.
1510160	1510536	B	0.5789287686347961	I'll.
1510568	1512684	A	0.7944444417953491	Make a bigger point now.
1512882	1513820	A	0.7286242246627808	What is time?
1513890	1542756	A	0.8002992868423462	This is partially addressed, and I guess the main thing I'll be doing here is rather than look back, look forward into what's to come in the course, in particular, I'm thinking about these two papers and in particular, and I finally chat with Chris about this this picture over here.
1542858	1543510	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
1544120	1544870	B	0.7732152342796326	More?
1545320	1546070	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1546760	1548420	A	0.7151075601577759	I'll get back to it in a bit.
1548490	1553432	A	0.8410425782203674	But basically, this sort of, like, kills two birds with a stone, right?
1553566	1559364	A	0.8600562214851379	This picture, and especially the text around it, and the title of this paper is The Physical Meaning of the Holographic Principle.
1559492	1559880	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
1559950	1565136	A	0.4806371331214905	You guys can see here archive 22, ten, blah, blah, blah.
1565188	1583504	A	0.8327394127845764	Anyways, this addresses the notion of time and entropy, because the claim that's made in this paper is that these are local observer relative definitions, and we can look into more detail around it.
1583542	1599210	A	0.7968332767486572	But basically, the coordinate ta time is an entropic measure, so it is non decreasing, and it goes up with the observer measuring entropy in the system.
1600060	1602084	A	0.8258224725723267	Because of the symmetry of the definition.
1602212	1604008	A	0.8539128303527832	The second law applies to both.
1604094	1612380	A	0.7287259697914124	So both observer and environment see entropy increasing in their environment and vice versa.
1613280	1620184	A	0.880615234375	Anyways, from this picture, one gets that you have this internal circle time QRF.
1620232	1633120	A	0.7908160090446472	So this just is a necessary artifact of recording information into a memory that's the claim made in the paper, and that essentially induces the passage of time, at least from the perspective of the observer.
1635080	1643856	A	0.6906423568725586	It also, I think, Alexey was talking about, which I totally understand and agree that there's different notions of entropy.
1643968	1658440	A	0.5398050546646118	Now, I suppose I would be the one to like definitions and so on, but I but I do think it's it's it's good to to have a certain amount of flexibility.
1659340	1663256	A	0.8735769987106323	So I see it the same as energy, right?
1663278	1664840	A	0.8066899180412292	Like, there are different kinds of energy.
1664910	1666804	A	0.8046791553497314	You know, there's energy mass equivalences.
1666852	1673470	A	0.8704180717468262	And, you know, if you push it into supersymmetry, you can think of it as equivalent to force also.
1674000	1679100	A	0.677416205406189	But I do think there is some value in being sloppy or intuitive about the notion.
1679180	1683228	A	0.8230626583099365	So the fact that entropy yes, there are different definitions.
1683404	1687156	A	0.6023280024528503	I don't see it quite as a problem one can explore here.
1687258	1694150	A	0.9066741466522217	Around this page, there is a definition of local entropic time.
1696360	1703264	A	0.8907085657119751	One can think of it as face pace, or one can think of it as coding theory, alashanum.
1703312	1709824	A	0.5976919531822205	But it is at the end of the day, I do think it is true that both of them are hinting at the same direction.
1709892	1717420	A	0.8088489174842834	Just like you may have different kinds of energy, but they're not unrelated concepts.
1718080	1718396	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1718418	1723920	A	0.5047337412834167	I hope one day we get very precise definitions out of everything, but for now, I think it's good to speculate.
1725540	1726290	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
1728420	1728736	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1728758	1730690	B	0.8655486702919006	Corby and then anyone else on this?
1731780	1732784	H	0.7650952339172363	Yeah, quick question.
1732822	1742980	H	0.8251537680625916	So I haven't read that specific paper, but is there any work on the frequency or the rate at which one could read and write information on the boundary?
1743640	1750108	A	0.6894410252571106	Yes, well, I can't think of the paper exactly, but this is lower bounded.
1750144	1753524	A	0.8833304047584534	I think Chris talked about it, if not in the last lecture.
1753652	1756132	A	0.8871045708656311	I think I've seen a talk of him on YouTube.
1756196	1758420	A	0.786267101764679	It's lower bounded by the uncertainty principle.
1758500	1759130	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
1761420	1768108	A	0.8418431282043457	For instance, Planck's constant is in units of action, which is energy times time.
1768194	1768588	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
1768674	1777744	A	0.7077416181564331	So Landauer's principle says you need a certain amount of energy to erase information and you have time.
1777782	1777936	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
1777958	1788660	A	0.6937912106513977	And then you have an energy time and certain principle putting those things together, you have a minimum amount of action, which is literally the minimum.
1789400	1791456	A	0.8779559135437012	The action is measuring what I said earlier.
1791488	1791876	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
1791978	1795924	A	0.7657415866851807	Like differences that make a difference, the minimum difference that you can make.
1796042	1803800	A	0.8268243074417114	So the minimum difference to erase a bit or rewrite it on the boundary, so to speak.
1803870	1804490	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
1805260	1809130	A	0.8069454431533813	So, yeah, that would be given by the uncertain relation, energy times time.
1809500	1813950	A	0.5428139567375183	I don't know exactly what the figure is, but it's obviously very small compared to everyday life.
1815520	1816124	H	0.5088188648223877	Got it.
1816162	1818232	H	0.9019807577133179	And is there work on the upper bound?
1818296	1822340	H	0.8789885640144348	Like, for example, would it be the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary?
1822520	1825280	A	0.7369381189346313	No, I don't think it's bounded from above.
1825620	1832156	A	0.8261374831199646	But obviously then we do want to bond it from above for technological reasons, if you wish.
1832188	1838720	A	0.5091720223426819	But I think that is an engineering problem, not one of physics.
1841300	1844390	B	0.8285048007965088	Andre, a few questions on this figure.
1846120	1848230	B	0.8529093265533447	What are Y and E?
1849740	1857284	B	0.8754395246505737	The blue oval, as Chris has pointed out, is going to consistently be the screen, the blanket.
1857412	1862952	B	0.8175405859947205	And so we often associate that with at least some blankets.
1863016	1867400	B	0.8740637898445129	Include these information gathering and utilizing systems.
1867560	1873616	B	0.8720216751098633	So what is happening internal to the agent here?
1873798	1876352	B	0.5198615193367004	What kind of computation is happening?
1876486	1881360	B	0.8172076344490051	And is this something that is actually proposed to be occurring?
1881940	1886980	B	0.8450257778167725	Or is this a schematic or a map of how we could think about something occurring?
1890680	1896020	A	0.651654064655304	I think this question is going to be better addressed by Chris himself, probably in the next lecture.
1897240	1910716	A	0.86461341381073	For now, what I can say is I can reiterate what I was trying to say earlier, which is that what this addresses and this basic measurement picture, so to speak, is the observer effect, right?
1910738	1918200	A	0.6922851204872131	Like this notion that you cannot observe something without disturbing the environment.
1918360	1938868	A	0.7902025580406189	So if you then try to make sense of this by constraining from first principles, land hours, principle and so on, basic requirements on information processing from the point of view of energy, then you get that this boundary is constrained in some ways, right?
1939034	1948484	A	0.8213747143745422	This Y is what's called the memory sector, meaning that you don't just act on the immediate information that you perceive.
1948532	1959396	A	0.8846463561058044	You may also act on stuff that's stored that you have perceived before then sure, e, the red part is what you're perceiving right now, the environment.
1959588	1967576	A	0.5442299842834473	But actually I don't know if I have it in here, but this is further broken up into other parts.
1967688	1971550	A	0.7012085318565369	So not schematically here, let me try to find it over here.
1982760	1986228	A	0.5774189233779907	Now, I don't know, actually, bear with me for a second.
1986314	1987750	A	0.7200998067855835	I think you might be here.
1994340	2001068	A	0.7443069219589233	That's the same picture anyways.
2001244	2007684	A	0.5857792496681213	I don't want to waste time by trying to find it, but back to the original picture sure.
2007882	2026044	A	0.7997955679893494	What you're measuring, and again, Chris will talk about this in more detail, but from first principle assumptions, they deduce that you're going to have to deploy your finite resources for gathering information in clever ways on the boundary, right?
2026082	2034092	A	0.8451704978942871	So you're going to have to deploy some resources for memory, some resources as a heat sink, right?
2034146	2049816	A	0.7104014158248901	So you're going to be processing information, you're going to be dumping so called low quality stuff into the environment, you're going to be dumping heat and then other than the memory, you're going to be focusing on what's going on right now in this environment.
2049868	2057760	A	0.6942054629325867	And what I wanted to say is that it can be further broken up into what's called pointer and reference sectors.
2057920	2066564	A	0.8222415447235107	So you can imagine this e sector here has to be broken into further sectors because then there is the other first principle notion.
2066612	2066920	A	0.7123861312866211	Okay?
2066990	2070232	A	0.8717650771141052	So what does it mean to observe something?
2070366	2072312	A	0.7594372034072876	The differences that make a difference, right?
2072366	2077148	A	0.7743398547172546	So there is only information with context, right?
2077234	2079020	A	0.6640708446502686	There is no information per se.
2079090	2080204	A	0.7547429203987122	It's all semantics, right?
2080242	2083416	A	0.7176713943481445	So you only observe things in context.
2083608	2091504	A	0.8501112461090088	So some things are going to have to stay the same, namely reference states here, and some things are going to bear, right?
2091542	2094112	A	0.8745201230049133	So you can think of this as the gauge in your car, right?
2094246	2102048	A	0.8718809485435486	Obviously the circle stays the same and that's your context, so to speak, with the numbers in it.
2102134	2104016	A	0.6374884247779846	They never go away, they stay the same.
2104118	2107348	A	0.8380529284477234	But as you speed up or down, the gauge is going to change.
2107434	2113590	A	0.7702551484107971	And that's how you know only in that context you can tell your own speed when you're driving a car, right?
2114120	2117610	A	0.6950395703315735	So anyways, this is just a teaser for things to come.
2118700	2120200	A	0.78996741771698	We can go back to more questions.
2120270	2121544	A	0.8484231233596802	Daniel, what do you think?
2121662	2124330	A	0.7876279354095459	I'll pick maybe two or three more over here.
2126140	2126660	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2126750	2132750	B	0.8556223511695862	Pick another question, or anyone raising their hand, or if anyone in the live chat wants to write something, I'll read it.
2133840	2135496	B	0.877568244934082	How about the WIC rotation?
2135608	2141010	B	0.9137998819351196	Could you summarize what the WIC rotation is and then state this question about it?
2142660	2144050	A	0.8635595440864563	That's a great question.
2144740	2146112	A	0.4796895682811737	I wish I knew the answer better.
2146166	2158100	A	0.8238217830657959	But formally speaking, the Wick rotation is just so Chris said, you take a quantity multiply by I square root of negative one.
2158170	2162132	A	0.8789868950843811	That amounts to a 90 degree rotation in a complex plane.
2162276	2162824	A	0.5034120678901672	Fine.
2162942	2165000	A	0.488865464925766	Now, that appears to be a trick.
2165420	2174010	A	0.8041741251945496	And what it does effectively is take you from quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics, roughly speaking.
2176060	2180936	A	0.6617491841316223	Now, why it works, I have no clue.
2180968	2182252	A	0.5621321201324463	I don't know the answer myself.
2182386	2196464	A	0.6652647256851196	But now when things appear to be a trick and they get you something, maybe there's more to it than what's apparent at first, but I myself don't know the answer.
2196582	2217284	A	0.6089227795600891	It's a very good question, but I do think it may have to do with the fact that on the one hand, quantum and statistical mechanics both are talking about constraints on information processing, maybe from different perspectives.
2217412	2223130	A	0.7360721230506897	But again, that's just speculation on my end, so it's maybe a way of relating the two.
2224560	2229950	B	0.8947324752807617	Could we just review just read Chris's full answer to this.
2230560	2233230	B	0.8613215088844299	Read the question, and then Chris's full answer.
2235440	2241970	A	0.8615394234657288	Does the weak rotation to ask that matter energy somehow exists 90 degrees perpendicular to a three dimensional space?
2249620	2251632	B	0.8397622108459473	And then I'll just read Chris's answer.
2251686	2252160	B	0.7793614864349365	Then anyone?
2252230	2254544	B	0.62575763463974	Please raise your hand if you want to add something more on this.
2254582	2260340	B	0.735108494758606	He wrote, in a sense, yes, time is perpendicular to our three dimensions of space, matter, and energy.
2260490	2262324	B	0.7682404518127441	We ourselves exist in time.
2262442	2269672	B	0.9084538221359253	Wick is pointing to the intimate relationship between how we measure time and how we determine or judge that something maintains its identity through time.
2269726	2270104	B	0.5757660269737244	I e.
2270142	2272120	B	0.8176754117012024	Stays the same thing through time.
2272270	2278744	B	0.8205658793449402	To tell time by a clock, I have to be sure I'm looking at the same clock set the same way, et cetera.
2278792	2281420	B	0.8245325088500977	We'll get to this in July and August.
2287180	2304220	B	0.9359674453735352	Could you connect this, Andrew, to some of the semantic information flows discussed in Live stream 17 or any of the other cone co cone diagrams from the papers that you showed earlier?
2305920	2306632	A	0.4753468334674835	Sure.
2306786	2330852	A	0.7725444436073303	Again, I have to preface it by saying that I am working on understanding it myself, but just from small email exchange that I had with Chris ant waste in this paper, one can sort of see that it's related to the picture I was showing earlier, namely this one.
2330906	2331172	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
2331226	2338312	A	0.8573853969573975	But let's scroll down a little bit to page to page 23 24.
2338446	2340890	A	0.6511948108673096	Here they talk out with rotation again.
2345500	2368112	A	0.8566601276397705	So I think it has it has to do with, at least from what I heard from crazy email, has to do with this notion of local time, the definition of local time in this observation picture, and the fact that you rotate 90.
2368166	2373892	A	0.7138904929161072	Degrees twice, you get the opposite sign, basically, right?
2373946	2390840	A	0.825667679309845	So the local time, effectively, that's going to ensure that the picture is symmetric and that the flow is going to be opposite in the direction towards the observer and towards the environment.
2395930	2397234	B	0.7454814910888672	Okay, Alexey, then.
2397292	2399100	B	0.8619890213012695	Anyone else raising their hands?
2400190	2412590	F	0.4689737856388092	I am struggling to understand and part of my difficulty bear with me for being so kind of but I remember Sean Carroll's lecture on time in different versions of physics, and it took a whole hour.
2412660	2415982	F	0.8712226152420044	So are we talking Newtonian time, which is universally the same?
2416036	2419562	F	0.8745503425598145	Are we talking relative time philosophically?
2419626	2426610	F	0.5058135986328125	Are we talking about people who believe that only present here and now is real, while future and past do not exist?
2426950	2434770	F	0.7776162028312683	So when we say time is perpendicular too, my sense is that just like Chris mentioned in the lecture, we're reinventing the time.
2434840	2439254	F	0.721705436706543	We're creating a new definition by calling it the same word we're all familiar with.
2439292	2446438	F	0.6548569798469543	And that creates some dissonance where I just think that maybe we need to kind of say that this is something new.
2446604	2450314	F	0.6442432999610901	And if it's not something new, then which version of the time are we talking about?
2450352	2452300	F	0.8389599919319153	Einsteinian, Newtonian or whatever?
2452830	2460620	F	0.7922298908233643	It's a simple question before we say it's perpendicular, do people agree that future is real or not?
2465950	2467994	B	0.6090378165245056	I'll give it all on this, Alexey.
2468122	2472240	B	0.7350903153419495	Again, speculation neither here nor then.
2473750	2497338	B	0.8411917686462402	If we take Chris seriously, that communication is an ontological primary and that rather than putting communications protocols in some sort of time newtonian time, Einsteinian time, these are these different time concepts, these different scaffolds that then communication gets inscribed within or stretched within.
2497504	2520240	B	0.8352247476577759	But if we start with a topological understanding of communication rather than a geometric understanding of spacetime so the topology of the blanket and the observer in their sensorium, then different kinds of cognitive agents, ranging from what we would call nonliving to what we could call living.
2521010	2529490	B	0.8266003131866455	They depending on their cognitive sophistication are able to create or project different time concepts.
2530630	2546390	B	0.8462252616882324	Time concepts that are not useful will lead to their own material dissolution, the failure to maintain that kind of cognitive sophistication, which requires not just information gathering and utilization, but also energy gathering and utilization.
2547230	2565150	B	0.8748199939727783	And so when you have multiple agents who are whether you conceptualize them as within a message passing relationship and having no surprise on the clock on the wall, then they're like in a local time synchrony.
2566370	2581170	B	0.8750145435333252	But the primary case is one entity engaging with its sensorium and itself modeling time in terms of progression.
2582950	2613950	B	0.8623049855232239	And so these previous time concepts and these different attempts to kind of survey the structure of space time reflect different cognitive models that cognitive agents have proposed for time and that communication actually takes ontological primacy over all of these ramified, potentially overlapping, potentially non overlapping time concepts.
2616050	2622350	B	0.7477618455886841	But they're downstream of agents cognitive models, not vice versa.
2623270	2629140	B	0.7482980489730835	I'm not sure it's how I interpreted what Chris said about communication being an ontological primary, though.
2633140	2640870	F	0.6367623805999756	So if we take one instance of a COVID-19 virus, a single kind of instance, right, it's got no memory and no ability to plan.
2641240	2648560	F	0.5930609107017517	Is there a local time for that virus versus humanity observing how the virus spreads across the globe?
2648640	2652040	F	0.8364254832267761	And we have agents with memory and planning.
2653900	2657000	F	0.881949245929718	Is there time relative to a single photon?
2659980	2668332	F	0.7746492624282837	My hunch is that there's a possibility that we're simply inventing something brand new and defining it brand new and they draw in parallel back to all these other times.
2668466	2670190	F	0.7594400644302368	I understand the effort, but.
2674000	2674524	A	0.6270087361335754	Is that.
2674562	2675440	F	0.8158926963806152	A brand new time?
2675510	2676784	F	0.8261116147041321	Is it some other kind of time?
2676822	2677810	F	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
2679060	2679596	A	0.6503534913063049	Daniel.
2679628	2680850	A	0.6804295778274536	Can I say words?
2681220	2691750	A	0.8597036004066467	So I understand Alexis question, and I think it's sort of related to, at least morally speaking, to your concern about different kinds of entropy, right?
2693640	2699384	A	0.8415015935897827	And what I can say is that also they have Glazebrook, Marciano and so on.
2699422	2710904	A	0.7918835878372192	They have this recent paper on quantum error correction, so I have yet to read it and take a closer look.
2710942	2714110	A	0.7705062031745911	But here they talk about space time, right?
2714720	2737564	A	0.4985883831977844	And my punch to address Alex's question is that if you could sort of recover the more familiar notions of time in a correspondence principle sort of way by taking some Newtonian limit or H bar goes to zero or speed of Glycos infinity and so on, that would be very satisfactory.
2737612	2744612	A	0.6680410504341125	Sure, they may be doing a new thing, but recovering old stuff in the new thing is a good sanity check.
2744666	2749830	A	0.9355857968330383	And so long as we can see that being worked out, I think I'd be very happy.
2752300	2772840	B	0.6710301041603088	And just to the virus point, I would argue that viruses, through their physical engagement, they do have memory, but they don't necessarily have the awareness or metacognition on that memory, except as granted by intergenerational evolutionary type pressure.
2773000	2782000	B	0.8654618263244629	But they do have past events modifying them within some set of possibilities.
2783460	2790390	B	0.7406255602836609	So they're just being them and their internal time.
2791880	2794980	B	0.6986168026924133	There isn't a cognitive observer necessarily.
2797080	2797444	A	0.5416930317878723	In.
2797482	2799164	B	0.6698009967803955	Terms of like a narrative.
2799232	2805050	B	0.8376338481903076	I I am watching the clock, but they do change.
2810360	2813220	B	0.5293316841125488	But it's certainly very provocative if this is not.
2813290	2822330	B	0.903440535068512	Or we could also look to Kronos and Cairos and about the relationship of time and timeliness and agentic time.
2824700	2833580	B	0.7048378586769104	And then at this point, are we stretching just this one four letter word too far, just like we brought up with information entropy?
2835120	2850850	B	0.767629086971283	Can we think about these as kind of like continents and then just if someone said, I visited this continent, you know that you need to specify a lot more, or what granularity are these topics corby and then anyone else raising their hands?
2852760	2853172	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2853226	2858896	H	0.9023295044898987	On this topic, for a Markov blanket, you have a transition matrix.
2859008	2866248	H	0.7915226221084595	My question is, how are you allowed to increment that transition matrix to calculate a future state?
2866414	2869210	H	0.8407958149909973	What does that mean in terms of time?
2869980	2876840	H	0.9046189188957214	Are you only allowed to increment it by the lower bound time, which is h over Ln and kBT.
2878560	2880110	H	0.7082726359367371	Does that question make sense?
2881920	2884268	B	0.6893258094787598	I'll give a first pass on this.
2884434	2888680	B	0.8423692584037781	We have discrete time and continuous time models in active inference.
2888840	2897788	B	0.8802531361579895	For a discrete time model where you have the B transition matrix, then the choice of Delta T is a modeler's decision.
2897884	2906928	B	0.5605745315551758	And we talked about this a lot in live stream 52 on accelerated optimization, there's some Delta T that's like, going to get you the most accelerated optimization.
2907024	2914788	B	0.8891137838363647	If you have too small of Delta T, then you're either oversampling or you're maybe even physically unrealistic like you pointed to.
2914874	2922980	B	0.5654346942901611	Or if you have some long Delta T, you're also not making an informative simulation in the discrete time case where you're explicitly making time steps.
2923140	2934936	B	0.8355045914649963	Contrast with the continuous time generative model, where we're doing more of a Taylor series expansion on the generalized coordinates, at which point Delta T is not required.
2935048	2942610	B	0.5753399133682251	You're merely just taking an extended approximation from a given snapshot, and so Delta T doesn't even come into play.
2945140	2945664	H	0.5088188648223877	Got it.
2945702	2947010	H	0.5064343810081482	Okay, that makes sense.
2948500	2952850	H	0.6879757046699524	I don't know how it ties into time, but it helps clarify a little bit.
2956760	2957220	B	0.584351658821106	Okay.
2957290	2965832	B	0.9122067093849182	Anyone else can raise their hand or under kind of maybe one more question or one more topic from a paper?
2965886	2978830	B	0.9188625812530518	Just what's one more puzzle piece that you think gives us a first coat of paint from questions submitted or from one of these papers that you have up?
2980080	2983710	B	0.704046368598938	What's something that helps us connect the dots a little bit?
2986640	2987932	A	0.6328192949295044	I don't think I have a good answer.
2987986	2996260	A	0.8379038572311401	Let me look at the questions again regarding time.
2996330	3005450	A	0.5448788404464722	I'll just reiterate what I said as I look over these questions, which is that I believe Chris will address it.
3007740	3019020	A	0.5784603953361511	I don't know if you can see what I'm sharing on the screen, but the paper, whose title is Communication Protocols blah blah blah from March of this year does talk about spacetime.
3019440	3027976	A	0.4953804016113281	It's a quantum error correction code, and to me personally, it'd be nice to see if that can be more familiar.
3028008	3035280	A	0.8500750660896301	Notions of time, such as special relativity can be recovered as limits in correspondence principles.
3039700	3041410	A	0.7780011296272278	Do you want me to say anything else?
3046210	3051700	B	0.658429741859436	If anyone could even just summarize what are these codes referring to?
3052070	3057010	B	0.8024666905403137	Or how are these codes one and the same as communication protocols?
3058250	3064390	B	0.5398111343383789	Or are they related to the blanket and the heat that was being output as waste?
3067770	3071340	B	0.6988537311553955	What will these codes allow us to do better if we understood them more?
3074430	3077100	A	0.5862104892730713	I don't know that I can answer that right now.
3077870	3080460	A	0.7550533413887024	I don't think they understand the question.
3081870	3083840	A	0.48837748169898987	Yeah, I just don't know.
3085410	3086160	A	0.509212851524353	Sorry.
3092120	3092784	B	0.5353715419769287	Terry.
3092832	3094870	B	0.7250629663467407	And then anyone else raising their hands.
3097640	3099060	C	0.550376832485199	I'm not a physicist.
3099140	3101930	C	0.957050621509552	I don't understand maths at all.
3103980	3129164	C	0.5632082223892212	But what attracted me to this idea of physics as information processing is that it feels like at a base level, whatever the unknowable external state is, it could be perceived as made up of information.
3129362	3148900	C	0.572180986404419	You know, we we kind of think of ourselves living in a particulate universe, but at a base level there are these and stop me if I'm just talking 14 year old nonsense here, but this notion of quantum fields, they feel like informational fields.
3149340	3170620	C	0.7198367714881897	And that the concept of physics is purely information that we then interpret as a physical universe which we inhabit because we can't see beyond our Markov blanket.
3173860	3177856	C	0.9887518286705017	I find this a really exciting idea.
3178038	3178770	G	0.5773851871490479	That.
3180660	3198000	C	0.8042603135108948	Whenever you start to think of the surprisal as the variational free energy between sort of your prior and your posterior, if you start to think of that variational free energy, not as energy but as an information gap.
3198080	3209690	C	0.5448108911514282	So that if you see the energy as actual because energy, when you think of energy in physics terms, it's kind of this magical thing that allows work to happen.
3210800	3211868	C	0.7406122088432312	But what is it?
3211954	3214350	C	0.767501950263977	We've got a term for it.
3216800	3218990	C	0.8816327452659607	Is it jewels or whatever?
3220240	3221244	C	0.7557080984115601	But what does it mean?
3221282	3222796	C	0.5737897157669067	It has this magical property.
3222898	3228112	C	0.7037910223007202	But if you think of it as information, then it starts to make sense.
3228166	3240180	C	0.8848360180854797	So variational free energy starts to be seen as a difference in information between your prior and your posterior.
3242040	3251800	C	0.8321779370307922	So whenever you start to think about time, time is this conceptual metric that we use almost because we have memory.
3253180	3259720	C	0.5794847011566162	And I wonder if we are getting trapped in this semantics.
3260060	3265196	C	0.8580085635185242	And all I have is English because I don't understand the maths really.
3265378	3274952	C	0.6283776760101318	But you guys come in here and you do understand the maths and then you convert it into English, which I think I understand.
3275106	3282530	C	0.6964077353477478	And then I can think of it like a kid in a sweetie shop or a physics class at 14 years of age.
3284020	3285660	C	0.502285897731781	I don't really know what I'm saying.
3285750	3286852	C	0.599547266960144	I don't know what I'm saying.
3286906	3295828	C	0.7331615090370178	But at a fundamental level, everything that we're talking about is I can understand it as information.
3295994	3299304	C	0.9839009642601013	And I'm excited to see how things develop.
3299422	3302040	C	0.5248517394065857	What are your thoughts on this craziness?
3305100	3308410	B	0.9603053331375122	So many great pieces in there.
3309820	3313020	B	0.7382471561431885	Physics as information processing.
3313680	3319710	B	0.8889266848564148	What is it that actually allows the steam engine to run and the ball to move?
3320320	3321980	B	0.6805293560028076	That kind of physics.
3322480	3336690	B	0.5785317420959473	And then as the timeline laid out, also occurring during a period of immense technology and apparatus development and digitization and all of this and unconventional computing as well.
3337540	3353450	B	0.650058388710022	It's almost like this materialist dualism that instead of with mind and body that there was some kind of dualism between the types of forces and energies and ways of thinking about what made the steam engine work and then what makes a computer work.
3354380	3365352	B	0.5471636652946472	And so you'd understand how the computer could fall off a cliff, but then you wouldn't necessarily be able to use that exact kind of mechanics and physics and dynamics to study like how the computer operated.
3365496	3367900	B	0.837429940700531	But you could say it weighed eleven pounds.
3368240	3380128	B	0.7011220455169678	And so I think the provocation, which is as you hinted towards first off, would be awesome to have a natural language math and graphical synthesis the triple play.
3380294	3399620	B	0.6261695623397827	But also then to use a common approach to understanding this and what wasn't working or is not proposed to work, is trying to fit information into that non cognitive universe.
3400220	3415550	B	0.6326188445091248	But rather if we take the cognitive primacy of communication, then all of these forces as inferred by the sensorium, which is all we're ever going to have, totally the most valid first principles constraint to make.
3416000	3432370	B	0.5358748435974121	Maybe then we'll be able to have a lot more synthesis about even how steam engines work when we understand that we're bound in that inference by our sensorium and all that comes along with that and the variational free energy bounding surprise on our generative model.
3434180	3435040	B	0.6498749852180481	Dean.
3439620	3448276	G	0.5421643853187561	I'm going to come at this from the position of a 14 year old lens because I don't think there's anything unique about that.
3448458	3460708	G	0.7059818506240845	I think on the most basic level, what I took away from Chris's lecture was that there's information processing of at least two types.
3460884	3474876	G	0.8141816258430481	One is figuring it out, as in figure five or any of these other figures that are up on the screen right now, or anything that stabilizes the world around us.
3474978	3480716	G	0.8666449189186096	I think examples have come up in this conversation already of topology or geometry.
3480908	3487848	G	0.8758564591407776	There's a second type of information processing which is outing the figure type of information which is searching.
3488044	3493716	G	0.8620433807373047	And I think Alexey used the expression which time are we talking about?
3493898	3496532	G	0.8083477020263672	So these two types of processes are quite different.
3496586	3512910	G	0.8551622629165649	If you do a comparative analysis of the two, you have information practicing and you have to have both of the processes to really get a sense conceptually of what it is that communication is really talking about.
3513440	3528896	G	0.8552026748657227	If you are information practicing your wayfinding until you collapse to something we might describe in a verb tense as way found it's in the quantizing of that invariant state, that vast ocean, if you want to think of it.
3528918	3559140	G	0.7920858860015869	Metaphorically out to all horizons on the manifold into a variant or a nuanced or a discretized or an orientation type of state where all of a sudden things like currents and temperature shifts and even things that we've applied labels to, like entropy and a transition matrix suddenly appear out of the seeming nothingness or the invariance.
3559300	3567740	G	0.7083747386932373	So that's not the math, but that's kind of stepping back and saying what is the math trying to say?
3567890	3571180	G	0.835626482963562	I think it boils down to the comparative analysis.
3571920	3585164	G	0.7333358526229858	And then I'm hoping that in the coming lectures, chris starts opening that up and doing kind of the back and forth between the two types of figuring it out and outing the figures.
3585212	3593270	G	0.80949467420578	Because I think when both are part of the conversation, that's when we start to get a sense of what's really going on.
3601340	3602376	B	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
3602558	3616460	B	0.7999957799911499	In this sort of closing sessions, especially if anyone hasn't added anything, please feel free to give any last reflections or questions arising.
3617120	3623650	B	0.6190931797027588	So first, as many people as would like can reflect that way.
3624740	3634084	B	0.8024315237998962	And then after every hand has been addressed, then ander if you could just give us a kind of look ahead.
3634202	3643540	B	0.9220465421676636	So avel first, then Anyone else with just where does this discussion take us and where do you want to continue to learn more about avel?
3645740	3647128	D	0.7079346776008606	So, two things.
3647214	3653960	D	0.9559500813484192	First, if I walk out of here without understanding what is coconut, I will be disappointed.
3655760	3660684	D	0.4955283999443054	And I don't actually expect it to happen in like 12 hours.
3660802	3662476	D	0.6838693618774414	That seems like it's something.
3662658	3687140	D	0.5795828700065613	But more seriously, I can agree with that difficulty that there is a unity between physical structure and communication protocols and that communication protocols are quantum reference frame, kind of individuate physical states, individuate meaningful measurement outcomes that are ray file as physical possibilities.
3687480	3694388	D	0.8387846946716309	But the question is then where do communication protocols, quantum merchants frame come from?
3694554	3699976	D	0.8084195256233215	Like, what are the physical determinants that bring about those things?
3700158	3705496	D	0.817211389541626	And that seems like a question that could be addressed at the conceptual level of this course.
3705598	3712830	D	0.8677674531936646	And I would like I saw the live stream 17, so that did not help.
3713440	3722972	D	0.7711745500564575	Anyway, I would like to have more grip into that if we can address it in the foreign courses.
3723036	3723810	A	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
3725220	3726210	B	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
3730020	3730844	B	0.7203873991966248	Anyone else?
3730902	3738470	B	0.7718315720558167	Especially if they haven't added anything yet, want to give kind of a closing thought?
3751310	3757434	B	0.5891491770744324	Yeah, there's a lot to learn and Chris brings up a lot in his lecture, even though we've only had one.
3757472	3765280	B	0.6658920645713806	It's one of the denser hours of epistemic resourcing that I've seen.
3765810	3771870	B	0.8262028694152832	And there's also all of these accessory and cutting edge works that under showing.
3772690	3785742	B	0.83713698387146	So I'm really looking forward to how we can continue to curate and improve the questions that we have so that the uncertainties in our generative model that we have, how would this be useful?
3785806	3786710	B	0.7871557474136353	What does this mean?
3786780	3788486	B	0.6576085090637207	Why is this variable this way?
3788588	3790310	B	0.7972099184989929	What is the implication for that?
3790460	3805530	B	0.7131003141403198	Those are all the great questions and let's just get them inscribed on our classical documents so that we can have other quantum cognitive agents reduce their uncertainty by looking at the responses.
3806590	3817440	B	0.7962493300437927	So with that under, if you could just look ahead to lecture two and just point towards where we're going to be going.
3821230	3834474	A	0.7316867113113403	Yes, lecture two will, I think from what I hear from Chris, is going to start to address these basic ontological aspects of the quantum measurement.
3834602	3847020	A	0.9077200889587402	So the two sources to look at would be two papers, mainly this one, Physical Meaning of Holographic Principle.
3847520	3850172	A	0.5198500752449036	This one's, by far the most pedagogical one.
3850226	3854800	A	0.8416096568107605	So if I had to suggest that books look at one, it would be this one.
3854870	3872816	A	0.7502611875534058	It's very easy to read, I think, but maybe for a bit more detail there's the slightly older one and they talk at length about Cocoa and the headgrounds here, Free Energy Principle for Generic Content Systems.
3873008	3876452	A	0.8111388087272644	So I think that's what's going to come in these two lectures.
3876516	3883370	A	0.8414323925971985	Basically, the main ideas behind these two papers and yeah, that's all I have to say.
3886140	3891900	B	0.9333721995353699	All right, well, thank you for all who joined this first discussion.
3892240	3896700	B	0.9787824749946594	Hope that it was fun for you and for the audience.
3897200	3903708	B	0.8583177328109741	And check out the course site for the readings to get ahead of the second lecture.
3903804	3913100	B	0.74014812707901	We'll all watch the second lecture and come back in about a month for the second discussion.
3913180	3917504	B	0.9280151128768921	Everyone's welcome to join, and the website has the registration information.
3917702	3927220	B	0.8638625144958496	And so now that we've seen a little bit of one way, it can be we may do something similar or we may do something different for the second discussion.
3927380	3929368	B	0.9296572804450989	So thanks again, everybody.
3929534	3930570	B	0.6936540007591248	See you later.
