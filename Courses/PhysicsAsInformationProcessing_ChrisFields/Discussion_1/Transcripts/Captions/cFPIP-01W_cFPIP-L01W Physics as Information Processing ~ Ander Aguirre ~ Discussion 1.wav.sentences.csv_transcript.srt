1
00:00:06,994 --> 00:00:07,669
Daniel: Hello and welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:10,135
It's June 3, 2023.

3
00:00:10,147 --> 00:00:12,394
We're in the first discussion section for

4
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:12,394
Physics as information processing course

5
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:16,756
with Chris Fields.

6
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:20,117
So welcome to all who are here on and off

7
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:20,185
camera.

8
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:23,442
Really exciting to see so many people

9
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:23,442
joining for this participatory discussion

10
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:26,787
section.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,085
So in this first interval, we're going to

12
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:29,085
go to anyone who raises their hand, and

13
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:29,085
it would be awesome to hear from everyone

14
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:29,085
who would like to share what excites them

15
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:29,085
about what they heard in the first

16
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:41,254
lecture.

17
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:45,663
How has their background and journey led

18
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:47,830
to them joining?

19
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:52,313
What are they hoping to learn and do in

20
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:53,471
this course?

21
00:00:54,524 --> 00:01:00,506
So firsthand we'll get to go, maybe.

22
00:01:00,513 --> 00:01:02,715
Ander you can actually start first, just

23
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:03,887
speaking as a normal participant.

24
00:01:03,895 --> 00:01:05,091
And then meanwhile, anyone is welcome to

25
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:06,184
raise their hands.

26
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:08,337
Ander: That sounds good.

27
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:12,741
So I am a mathematician by training, but

28
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:12,741
I've always been interested in the more

29
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:18,381
physics side of things.

30
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:23,834
And in particular, I followed Chris's

31
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:28,315
work pretty closely since probably 2019.

32
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:33,868
I'm just very interested in the whole

33
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:33,868
ontology of quantum measurement, what it

34
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:36,145
means.

35
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,480
I feel like very often when it's taught

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:39,480
in physics classes, it's hand waved away.

37
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,784
.

38
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:45,007
And even though I myself subscribe to the

39
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:45,007
philosophy of shut up and compute,

40
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:45,007
sometimes not everything you need to do a

41
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:45,007
little bit of philosophy, maybe, and this

42
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:45,007
may be one of the things where you need

43
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:45,007
to do it and you need to address it from

44
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:59,141
first principles.

45
00:01:59,142 --> 00:01:59,143
Right?

46
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:00,099
And I think Chris is doing that.

47
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,127
So I'm just here to learn more.

48
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:06,152
And yeah, that's basically it.

49
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,172
Daniel: Awesome.

50
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:10,192
I'll just go from the top left because I'

51
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:10,192
'm not necessarily watching, like, what

52
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:13,222
order, but Ross first.

53
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:16,256
Ross: Hi.

54
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:21,308
I'm interested in the kind of overlap

55
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:21,308
between cognitive science and physics and

56
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:21,308
seeing if there are any panpsychist

57
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:21,308
implications of the observation that

58
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:21,308
physical processes seem to follow the

59
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:21,308
same kind of principle that we see

60
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:43,525
applied to brains and cognitive systems.

61
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:47,560
Daniel: Awesome.

62
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:48,574
Thank you. Avel?

63
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,610
Avel: Hi.

64
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:54,631
I'm Avel Guenin-Carlut.

65
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,685
I have mixed backgrounds, mostly physics

66
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:02,651
and cognitive science.

67
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:04,676
Right now, I could be qualified as a

68
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:04,676
philosopher of physics and cognitive

69
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:07,707
science.

70
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,733
And I'm interested in basically

71
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:10,733
formalizing participatorialism, the idea

72
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:10,733
that observer participates in creating

73
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:17,804
reality.

74
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:20,834
I did some work in formalizing that in

75
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:20,834
the case of social norms and things like

76
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:24,870
language.

77
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,899
And I met a block based on my lack of

78
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:26,899
knowledge of quantum physics and the

79
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:32,957
mathematical tools that I used for that.

80
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,988
So I'm here in a course to get those

81
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:37,001
formal skills.

82
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:39,028
Daniel: Awesome.

83
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:40,033
Thank you,

84
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,046
Avel. Bleu?

85
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:46,094
Bleu: I think Alexey was first.

86
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,120
Daniel: Okay, Alexey, go for it.

87
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:50,130
Bleu: Sorry.

88
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:51,145
Ali: Hi, I'm Alexey.

89
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:53,165
I'm a clinical psychologist in Maryland.

90
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,172
In the States.

91
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:56,197
I work with patients, do psychotherapy

92
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:57,202
mostly.

93
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:00,171
My interest came through Mark Solms, who

94
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:00,171
is the creator and leader of

95
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:00,171
neuropsychoanalysis, and he has been

96
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:00,171
collaborating with Friston on “the hard

97
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:00,171
problem of consciousness,” and he's now

98
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:12,294
working on AI with emotions.

99
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:15,324
I blame him.

100
00:04:15,324 --> 00:04:17,347
I say it with respect and love that for

101
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:17,347
introducing mathematics into our field,

102
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:22,394
which was mostly devoid of mathematics.

103
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:24,415
And people started looking at these

104
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:24,415
partial differential equations and Markov

105
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:27,447
blankets.

106
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:30,474
So I wrote a paper about a possible

107
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:30,474
extension of their model to include chaos

108
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:30,474
theory and I just want to understand

109
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:38,551
deeper concepts involved.

110
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:40,569
I have some understanding of them, but

111
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:40,579
perhaps not enough.

112
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:43,600
And I'm enjoying this course a great deal.

113
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:43,600
.

114
00:04:43,604 --> 00:04:45,627
I think Chris, among other things, is a

115
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:45,627
fantastic teacher and he is able to

116
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:45,627
express things very clearly and I have

117
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:51,688
awe – I have goosebumps.

118
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:54,709
So I'm very grateful to everybody and

119
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:55,720
thank you so much.

120
00:04:56,736 --> 00:04:57,741
Daniel: Cool.

121
00:04:57,743 --> 00:04:58,750
Bleu. Then, Francesco.

122
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,723
Bleu: Hi, everyone.

123
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:02,734
I'm Bleu Knight.

124
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:04,756
I'm with the Active Inference Institute.

125
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:07,787
So I've been tracking this work of Chris'

126
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:07,787
's connecting quantum information and

127
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:07,787
Active Inference for, I don't know, a

128
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:14,859
couple of years now.

129
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,900
Through that thread, I'm super interested

130
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,900
actually in the aspect of spacetime

131
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,962
arising from communication.

132
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:28,995
I think that that's like fascinating to

133
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:28,995
dive into and how it connects to the

134
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:28,995
Buddhist and maybe more Eastern religion

135
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:28,995
concept of dependent arising, like how

136
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:28,995
the interdependence of all things leads

137
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:43,143
to their existence.

138
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:45,163
From that aspect.

139
00:05:45,164 --> 00:05:48,189
I think that's what I'm most interested

140
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:48,189
in exploring my background is

141
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:48,189
neuroscience, but I've also been studying

142
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:55,261
practicing Buddhism for like 25 years.

143
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:57,282
So yeah, that's it.

144
00:05:57,282 --> 00:05:57,288
Thanks.

145
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:00,250
Daniel: Awesome.

146
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:01,260
Francesco. Then, Corby.

147
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,284
Dean: Thanks,

148
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:04,294
Daniel. Ciao, everyone!

149
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:05,307
Super happy to be here.

150
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:08,330
I also have a mixed background because I

151
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,330
studied cognitive anthropology and

152
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,361
philosophy of science.

153
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:13,388
And currently a few months ago I started

154
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:13,388
a PhD in artificial intelligence in an

155
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:13,388
8th application in the educational field.

156
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:19,440
.

157
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:22,473
And yes, I'm actually super excited about

158
00:06:22,473 --> 00:06:22,473
all the science based implications that

159
00:06:22,473 --> 00:06:22,473
Chris Fields mentioned in the first

160
00:06:22,473 --> 00:06:28,539
lecture.

161
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,560
The connection I have no background in

162
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:31,560
physics, but the connections between the

163
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:31,560
first principles, physics and free energy

164
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:31,560
principle and scientific cognition in

165
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:31,560
general is what is really getting me

166
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:40,657
excited in these days.

167
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,668
Daniel: Thank you.

168
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,701
Cool.

169
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:46,711
Corby. Then,

170
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:48,731
anyone else who raises their hand.

171
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:51,768
Corby: Yeah, great to be here.

172
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:54,798
My background is in quantum engineering.

173
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,819
I've always been motivated by figuring

174
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:57,819
out what the next big thing in computing

175
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:59,843
was.

176
00:06:59,843 --> 00:07:01,806
In high school, Moore’s Law was sort of

177
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:01,806
coming to an end and it seemed like a

178
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:01,806
really big opportunity to figure out what

179
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:01,806
the next big computing architecture might

180
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:08,879
be.

181
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,897
So I did academic research in

182
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:10,897
neuromorphic computing, quantum computing

183
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:14,936
and quantum sensors.

184
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:16,956
And I felt like I was a little bit too

185
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:18,972
early for all of those things.

186
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:22,013
So I went into cloud and cloud gaming and

187
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:24,035
streaming AI services.

188
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:26,056
But I'm still extremely motivated to

189
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:26,056
figure out what the next big thing is.

190
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:30,091
And the Holographic principle

191
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:32,118
seems like a good foundation to explore

192
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,124
Ander: that.

193
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:38,169
Daniel: Awesome.

194
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,188
I'll raise my own hand then.

195
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,211
Anyone else is welcome to go.

196
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,225
So, I'm Daniel.

197
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,255
I'm a researcher at the institute and

198
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:46,255
have known ander for some years and

199
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:46,255
learned about all kinds of Stochastic

200
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:46,255
matrices and how the math and the quantum

201
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:55,346
were linked.

202
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:58,371
And we had talked and joked about

203
00:07:58,371 --> 00:07:58,371
learning from Chris Fields for a long

204
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:01,342
time.

205
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:04,379
So when the opportunity arose to enact it

206
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:04,379
and extend it and open it, we were very

207
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:04,379
excited and also don't have much of a

208
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:04,379
formal background in physics outside of

209
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:04,379
working with Yaaka bin Ali on Live stream

210
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:19,522
49.

211
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,572
So it's just going to be a great time to

212
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,597
learn and see where it all goes.

213
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,673
Anyone else want to say hello in this

214
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:36,695
kind of opening section?

215
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:46,799
Okay, well, continuing forward, of course,

216
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:46,799
, please just feel free to raise your

217
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:46,799
hand anytime you'd like to jump into the

218
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:46,799
stack. Andre, for several minutes or

219
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:57,902
however you see,

220
00:08:57,903 --> 00:09:02,893
could you reflect on Lecture One?

221
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,926
Where did Chris enter?

222
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,943
How did he proceed?

223
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:10,971
And where did the lecture take us?

224
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,016
Thank you.

225
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,028
Ander: Yeah.

226
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,048
Daniel: {Can you zoom in a little bit

227
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:18,057
more on the PDF?}

228
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:22,093
Ander: {Can you hear me?}

229
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,100
Daniel: {Thank you.}

230
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,110
{Go for it.}

231
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:26,132
Ander: Let's take a look at the slides

232
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,141
from last time.

233
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:30,176
So I think if we were to summarize this

234
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:30,176
whole lecture, basically what Chris was

235
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:30,176
trying to say is that there are many

236
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:30,176
hands coming from different directions,

237
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:43,304
pointing at the same thing, right?

238
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:47,340
Pointing at the fact that information

239
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,340
will have a central aspect in physics in

240
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,340
the future, but also possibly biology,

241
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:55,423
right?

242
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:58,459
So the earliest hints came from

243
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:58,459
statistical mechanics, if you wish, but

244
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:07,481
also quantum mechanics, right?

245
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,508
And here we need to make an important but

246
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:09,508
subtle distinction between what it is,

247
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:14,556
the uncertainty principle, right?

248
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:16,578
Because we think of that as the

249
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:18,596
informational part, right?

250
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:21,622
Like a limit on the resolution on

251
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:21,622
information and what is the observer

252
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,656
effect.

253
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,675
Just to make that distinction clear.

254
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:29,701
I think Chris is talking about the

255
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:30,714
observer effect.

256
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:34,753
The uncertainty principle is an artifact

257
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:34,753
of the wave nature of quantum mechanics,

258
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:38,797
right?

259
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:41,819
You can get it from properties of the

260
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:41,819
Fourier transform, cautious words,

261
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:43,846
inequality.

262
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,868
But at the end of the day, it's what I

263
00:10:45,868 --> 00:10:47,883
was saying earlier, right?

264
00:10:47,885 --> 00:10:50,914
What is the basic picture of measurement,

265
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:50,919
right?

266
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,944
And that's sort of what Crease with

267
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:53,944
Glazebrook and Marciana is trying to

268
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,975
address.

269
00:10:57,982 --> 00:11:00,954
And the first two hints came from quantum

270
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:00,954
mechanics around 1900 and statistical

271
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:06,010
mechanics a few decades earlier.

272
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:10,051
Then there's more stuff, right?

273
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:14,092
Like, obviously physicists resisted to

274
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:14,092
inertia of hundreds of years of a totally

275
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:14,092
objective, observer independent universe,

276
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:14,092
but the hints continued to pile on some

277
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:30,249
stuff coming from math.

278
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,288
But perhaps the most interesting is,

279
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:33,288
again, how all those paradoxes from

280
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:33,288
statistical mechanics were made sense of

281
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:44,396
with Landauers proposal.

282
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:48,433
And then as physics got more fancy past

283
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:48,433
QFT and stuff, people started thinking

284
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:48,433
about quantum information more seriously.

285
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:55,499
.

286
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,525
So we had Bell Serum and all these

287
00:11:57,525 --> 00:11:57,525
proposals by Deutsche and Wheeler and so

288
00:11:57,525 --> 00:12:00,499
on.

289
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:04,537
And I should say that this is not a

290
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:06,557
fringe idea in physics.

291
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,585
The paradigm of it from qubit is very

292
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:10,595
much mainstream.

293
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,609
I mean, Google it.

294
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,640
A lot of physicists think about it.

295
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:17,663
I don't know how many of them talk about

296
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:17,665
it.

297
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:20,695
Openly, but it's been a widespread folk

298
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:20,695
intuition, so to speak, that information

299
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:26,753
will have this sort of central role.

300
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,785
And the last sort of hints pointing in

301
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:29,785
that direction of information having a

302
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:29,785
central law came on the one side from

303
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:36,849
high energy stuff.

304
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,876
And that's what the Holographic principle

305
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:38,878
is.

306
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,912
It originally arose in the context of

307
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:42,912
black hole thermodynamics, but then it

308
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:42,912
was extended to what's called the Ads CFT

309
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:50,995
correspondence.

310
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:54,031
And the very most recent stuff was

311
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:54,031
basically one side from high energy stuff.

312
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:58,076
.

313
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:02,059
Sorry, I can speak a little more loudly.

314
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:03,069
Daniel: It's all good.

315
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:04,072
Continue.

316
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:05,081
Honor.

317
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:06,099
Ander: Yeah, I thought there was a

318
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:07,103
question.

319
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:08,116
Daniel: Someone was just unmuted.

320
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:09,124
It's all good.

321
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:10,133
Ander: Okay.

322
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:11,145
Yeah.

323
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:13,164
So that's basically it, right?

324
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:17,203
There's hints from many directions, and

325
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:17,203
most recently the work of Friston and

326
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:17,203
Levin coming from biology, all pointing

327
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:24,276
in the same direction, right.

328
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:28,314
That we might have to make sense of some

329
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:28,314
sort of eventually scale free information

330
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:28,314
processing per data for what it means to

331
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:37,407
be an observer.

332
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:41,440
All of these things are pointing in that

333
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,444
direction.

334
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,469
And I think Chris's work is addressing

335
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:44,477
that head on.

336
00:13:44,478 --> 00:13:45,483
Right.

337
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:47,507
As I said earlier, sometimes it's good to

338
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:47,507
do computations, but sometimes you need

339
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:47,507
to take a step back and think more

340
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:47,507
philosophically about what you're doing

341
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:56,591
and what the bigger picture is.

342
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:02,597
And then maybe after people talk a little

343
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:02,597
bit, we can warm up to the second lecture.

344
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:05,627
.

345
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:08,654
The other windows that I have open here,

346
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:08,654
some of them are the papers that are to

347
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:11,683
come.

348
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:14,712
Yeah.

349
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:14,717
Anyone?

350
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:16,739
Daniel: Please feel free to raise your

351
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:17,746
hand on this.

352
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:19,763
Alexey and then anyone else?

353
00:14:21,787 --> 00:14:24,813
Ali: I had one thought about this thing

354
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:24,813
when you mentioned that there's various

355
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:29,863
perspectives on the same concept.

356
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:31,881
And I'm trying to be cautious.

357
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:33,907
On the one hand, I think, again, this

358
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:33,907
amazing clarity and precision with which

359
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:33,907
Chris expressed thoughts is fantastic and

360
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:40,972
enjoyable.

361
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:41,988
On the other hand, it requires

362
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:43,006
simplification and generalization.

363
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,032
And what I observe in my field is people

364
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:46,032
take a term like entropy and run with it.

365
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:48,058
.

366
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:51,080
And then they get very quickly from

367
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,080
thermodynamic entropy to Shannon to

368
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,112
whatever entropy.

369
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:56,137
And they talk about sort of and that's

370
00:14:56,137 --> 00:14:57,146
not the case.

371
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,110
I mean, if we go back to Klausius and all

372
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,110
the others, there was a system of

373
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,110
postulates and axioms that must be

374
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,154
maintained.

375
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:06,178
And if you step outside of that so, like

376
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:08,197
us organisms, we're open systems.

377
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,209
We're not closed systems.

378
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,226
So we should not apply directly.

379
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:14,253
Second law thermodynamics and I deal a

380
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:14,253
little more with comogorphs and eye

381
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:19,305
entropy, which is not the same thing.

382
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:22,331
And I guess when we very quickly move

383
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:22,331
from sort of thermodynamics to

384
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:22,331
statistical mechanics with Boltzman to

385
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:22,331
all the way around and we assume it is

386
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:22,331
the same thing, I think we may need to be

387
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:22,331
careful because we are just ignoring the

388
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:36,473
differences in assumptions.

389
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:38,496
Shannon talked about telegraph.

390
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:40,519
He talked about a receiver getting a

391
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,537
message from a sender, right?

392
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:46,577
And Clausius talked about gas.

393
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:50,613
But I do think it's a balancing act and

394
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:50,613
there's no way to not have simplification

395
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:53,643
and generalization.

396
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:56,670
I just wanted to say somewhere, somehow

397
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:56,670
we need to kind of go back there and just

398
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:56,670
say entropy is not entropy is not entropy.

399
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,666
.

400
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,696
And all these things are kind of long

401
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:05,708
papers, right?

402
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:19,841
Ander: Yes.

403
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:21,867
Daniel: Yakub, then Ali, then anyone

404
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:22,871
else?

405
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:30,956
Ander: I just wanted to ask for, I guess

406
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:30,956
perhaps slightly longer comment from

407
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:30,956
Alexi on what you see as the fundamental

408
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:30,956
differences in different descriptions of

409
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:30,956
entropy and whether there is some general

410
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:30,956
concept that could be extracted from all

411
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:30,956
of them, such as level of information or

412
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:54,195
uncertainty about a particular system.

413
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:58,230
Even though these specific formulations

414
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,230
of entropy, they talk about, they were

415
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,230
derived from different specific systems

416
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,230
and they have different equations

417
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,230
describing them and they mean slightly

418
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,230
different things, do you think it would

419
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,230
be wrong to say that there is some

420
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:18,375
commonality between them?

421
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,433
Ali: Should I answer Daniel or yeah,

422
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:24,438
please.

423
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,475
I don't know, I just think we need to at

424
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:28,475
some point formalize it and be careful

425
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:32,517
with these generalizations.

426
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:35,542
For example, when we talk about Active

427
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,561
Inference and Kristen right.

428
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:38,579
When we say living organisms must

429
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:38,579
minimize I'm quoting Kristen, by the way,

430
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:42,613
these are not my thoughts.

431
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:45,643
The entropy of sensory states, right?

432
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:47,666
And then people take that idea sometimes

433
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:47,666
and generalize and they say that that's

434
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,708
what life is, minimization of entropy.

435
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,713
Right?

436
00:17:52,714 --> 00:17:55,740
But if you actually look into human brain

437
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:55,740
and measure entropy, then it goes all

438
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,732
over the place, up, down and in between.

439
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:03,762
And so I don't think that's an accurate

440
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:04,770
description.

441
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:06,790
And the reason for that is where we

442
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,808
shifted away from the assumptions.

443
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,833
And again, so comagorfsini entropy talks

444
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:10,833
about the phase space and the divergence

445
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:10,833
of trajectories in phase space and sort

446
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:10,833
of the volume and face space, while when

447
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:10,833
you talk about this Briston's entropy of

448
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:10,833
sensory states, these are probability

449
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:23,960
distributions.

450
00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:25,988
And Shannon talked about the uncertainty

451
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:25,988
of the receiver, about the message sent

452
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:29,002
by the sender.

453
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:32,004
So if you want to extract the same thing,

454
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:33,006
I suppose you can.

455
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:35,008
But it's important not to lose at least

456
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:35,008
the difference between what kind of

457
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:39,012
object are we applying to?

458
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:40,013
Are we looking at probability

459
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:41,014
distributions?

460
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:42,015
Are we looking at phase space?

461
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:44,017
Are we looking at ideal gas?

462
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:45,018
Where are we at?

463
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:47,020
And we're just not to say entropy is

464
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,022
entropy is entropy.

465
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:50,023
That's not the case.

466
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:53,026
It's just a formula, but depending on the

467
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:53,026
context, assumptions and things, it can

468
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:56,029
be very different.

469
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:04,031
Daniel: Thanks, Ali.

470
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:05,032
And Avel.

471
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,035
Ali: Yes.

472
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:11,038
In regard to Alex's comments, I just

473
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:11,038
wanted to mention the research of people

474
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:11,038
like Rudolph Hannel and Stefan Surger,

475
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:11,038
because for many years they've been

476
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:11,038
exploring this idea of different

477
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:11,038
conceptions of entropy and they've come

478
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:11,038
up with at least a dozen different

479
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:29,056
meanings for entropy.

480
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:33,060
And they've formulated it in a kind of

481
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,060
generalized framework, but at the same

482
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,060
time, they've also devised a way to

483
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,060
somehow classify them into equivalence

484
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,060
classes and to see whether one or more of

485
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,060
those conceptions of entropy can be

486
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,060
theoretically derived from some others or

487
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,060
they're totally distinct and different

488
00:19:33,060 --> 00:20:01,082
conceptions of entropy.

489
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:04,085
So, yes, I agree that in some situations,

490
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:04,085
we need to be more specific about what

491
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:04,085
exactly we mean by entropy and

492
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:10,091
information.

493
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:15,096
I mean, based on the question or the

494
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:16,097
situation of interest.

495
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,101
Daniel: Thanks, Avil.

496
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:26,107
Avel: So, just to vote in the entropy

497
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:26,107
discussion, I want to emphasize that

498
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:29,110
entropy is PLNP.

499
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,113
So it's a function of probability

500
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:32,113
distribution, which is I think I'm not

501
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:32,113
sure what the term is in English, but it'

502
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:32,113
's a measure of how big something is in a

503
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:41,122
space.

504
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:44,125
And to get that, you have to define a

505
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:44,125
space.

506
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,127
And in many case, it's pretty arbitrary

507
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:46,127
to decide what the space you're looking

508
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:49,130
at is.

509
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:53,134
For example, you talk I don't know if it

510
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:53,134
was Alexa, someone talked about entropy

511
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:58,139
of fMRI.

512
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:01,136
Well, those are aggregate measurements of

513
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,137
general activity.

514
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:05,140
This is not the space of all possible

515
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,141
configuration.

516
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,143
And even if I add something like the

517
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:08,143
space of all, let's say, functional

518
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:08,143
configuration, the state in neuron that

519
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:08,143
reflect activity, this would be another

520
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:08,143
thing than the space of atomic

521
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:08,143
configuration, where the specific atom

522
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:22,157
are.

523
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,162
You don't have a warranty that when you

524
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:27,162
define entropy, you define it on a

525
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:31,166
meaningful space that's not given.

526
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,172
I kind of think there is one entropy and

527
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:40,175
that's it, and it's an info construct.

528
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:43,178
But also we have to if we agree to that,

529
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:46,180
then it entails that we have to find it.

530
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:49,184
It's not just given out there in the data.

531
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,184
.

532
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:06,195
Daniel: Well, certainly being precise in

533
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:06,195
the formalism and in natural language for

534
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:06,195
what we mean by information and entropy

535
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:16,205
and all these terms is pretty important.

536
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:18,207
I mean, the course we're in is physics as

537
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:20,209
information processing.

538
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:24,213
But without an understanding of how

539
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:24,213
information is being meant here or what

540
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:24,213
measurements and transformations were

541
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:24,213
performing what informational operations,

542
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:41,230
then it is a non sequitur.

543
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,234
So how do we go about clarifying or

544
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:45,234
understanding what kinds of theoretical

545
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:45,234
results in a given domain or, like, what

546
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:45,234
is shown on the timeline here might apply

547
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:58,247
to some other area?

548
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:04,247
Just one thought.

549
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:08,251
Anyone else can raise their hand with a

550
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:10,253
thought or a question.

551
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:15,258
Otherwise honor, you can maybe flip over

552
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:15,258
to select a few of the submitted

553
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:20,263
questions.

554
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:24,267
Cool.

555
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:27,270
Could you zoom in with control plus a

556
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,271
fair amount?

557
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:33,276
Thanks.

558
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:36,279
So, everyone, we really appreciate the

559
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,280
submitted questions.

560
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,283
We've been able to get 13 answered by

561
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:42,285
Chris so far.

562
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,287
And as with the transcripts of the

563
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:44,287
discussions and lectures, the questions

564
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:44,287
and answers are going to be part of what

565
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:51,294
is published by the Octemf Journal.

566
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:55,298
So we really encourage basic questions,

567
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:55,298
advanced questions, just there's no

568
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:55,298
question that doesn't make sense to

569
00:23:55,298 --> 00:24:02,299
submit.

570
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:05,302
So, Andre, maybe just pick one question

571
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:05,302
that you think is interesting to begin

572
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:05,302
with and summarize Chris's response, and

573
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:05,302
then everyone else is welcome to kind of

574
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:15,312
add some other thoughts on this.

575
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:18,315
Ander: So, I'm going to scroll up and

576
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:19,316
down just to sort of sample.

577
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:21,318
Let me start with the first two.

578
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:22,319
Can you hear me?

579
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,320
Well?

580
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,323
Yes, since perhaps I think you submitted

581
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:28,325
this as a trial, right?

582
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:29,326
Is that right?

583
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:29,326
Yeah.

584
00:24:30,326 --> 00:24:31,328
So what is information?

585
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:32,329
What is time?

586
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,332
Here is Chris's response.

587
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:37,334
I guess everyone has a chance to look at

588
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:37,334
it.

589
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:40,337
Now, if I am to summarize this, the one

590
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:40,337
thing I've heard that personally, the one

591
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:40,337
I like the most, answer, at least as an

592
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:40,337
Adash, to summarize it, is that

593
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:40,337
information are differences that make a

594
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:52,349
difference.

595
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:54,351
This I might have heard from Chris, I

596
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:55,352
might have heard from someone else.

597
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:56,353
I don't remember.

598
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:58,355
But that's one thing.

599
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:02,353
Now, onto the question of what is time,

600
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:02,353
and I guess this also addresses Alex's

601
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:07,358
question of what is entropy.

602
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:10,361
Daniel: I'll.

603
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:12,363
Ander: Make a bigger point now.

604
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:13,364
What is time?

605
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:17,368
This is partially addressed, and I guess

606
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:17,368
the main thing I'll be doing here is

607
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:17,368
rather than look back, look forward into

608
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:17,368
what's to come in the course, in

609
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:17,368
particular, I'm thinking about these two

610
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:17,368
papers and in particular, and I finally

611
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:17,368
chat with Chris about this this picture

612
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:42,393
over here.

613
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:43,394
Okay.

614
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:44,395
Daniel: More?

615
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:46,397
Ander: Yeah.

616
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:48,399
I'll get back to it in a bit.

617
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:51,402
But basically, this sort of, like, kills

618
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:53,404
two birds with a stone, right?

619
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,406
This picture, and especially the text

620
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:55,406
around it, and the title of this paper is

621
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:55,406
The Physical Meaning of the Holographic

622
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:59,410
Principle.

623
00:25:59,410 --> 00:25:59,410
Okay.

624
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,408
You guys can see here archive 22, ten,

625
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,410
blah, blah, blah.

626
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,413
Anyways, this addresses the notion of

627
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:08,413
time and entropy, because the claim that'

628
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:08,413
's made in this paper is that these are

629
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:08,413
local observer relative definitions, and

630
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:23,428
we can look into more detail around it.

631
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:27,432
But basically, the coordinate ta time is

632
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:27,432
an entropic measure, so it is non

633
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:27,432
decreasing, and it goes up with the

634
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:27,432
observer measuring entropy in the system.

635
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:39,444
.

636
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:42,447
Because of the symmetry of the definition.

637
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:42,447
.

638
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,448
The second law applies to both.

639
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:47,452
So both observer and environment see

640
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:47,452
entropy increasing in their environment

641
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:52,457
and vice versa.

642
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,461
Anyways, from this picture, one gets that

643
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:00,459
you have this internal circle time QRF.

644
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,461
So this just is a necessary artifact of

645
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:02,461
recording information into a memory that'

646
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:02,461
's the claim made in the paper, and that

647
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:02,461
essentially induces the passage of time,

648
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:02,461
at least from the perspective of the

649
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:13,472
observer.

650
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:17,476
It also, I think, Alexey was talking

651
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:17,476
about, which I totally understand and

652
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:17,476
agree that there's different notions of

653
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:23,482
entropy.

654
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:27,486
Now, I suppose I would be the one to like

655
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:27,486
definitions and so on, but I but I do

656
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:27,486
think it's it's it's good to to have a

657
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:38,497
certain amount of flexibility.

658
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:43,502
So I see it the same as energy, right?

659
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:44,503
Like, there are different kinds of energy.

660
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
.

661
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:46,505
You know, there's energy mass

662
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:46,505
equivalences.

663
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:49,508
And, you know, if you push it into

664
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:49,508
supersymmetry, you can think of it as

665
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:53,512
equivalent to force also.

666
00:27:54,512 --> 00:27:56,515
But I do think there is some value in

667
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:56,515
being sloppy or intuitive about the

668
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:59,518
notion.

669
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:01,514
So the fact that entropy yes, there are

670
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,516
different definitions.

671
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,519
I don't see it quite as a problem one can

672
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,520
explore here.

673
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,524
Around this page, there is a definition

674
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,527
of local entropic time.

675
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,532
One can think of it as face pace, or one

676
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:19,532
can think of it as coding theory,

677
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:23,536
alashanum.

678
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,538
But it is at the end of the day, I do

679
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:25,538
think it is true that both of them are

680
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:29,542
hinting at the same direction.

681
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:33,546
Just like you may have different kinds of

682
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:33,546
energy, but they're not unrelated

683
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:37,550
concepts.

684
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:38,551
Yeah.

685
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,553
I hope one day we get very precise

686
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:40,553
definitions out of everything, but for

687
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:43,556
now, I think it's good to speculate.

688
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:46,559
Okay.

689
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:48,561
Yeah.

690
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,563
Daniel: Corby and then anyone else on

691
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:50,563
this?

692
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:52,565
Corby: Yeah, quick question.

693
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,568
So I haven't read that specific paper,

694
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:55,568
but is there any work on the frequency or

695
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:55,568
the rate at which one could read and

696
00:28:55,568 --> 00:29:02,569
write information on the boundary?

697
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,573
Ander: Yes, well, I can't think of the

698
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
paper exactly, but this is lower bounded.

699
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:10,577
.

700
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:12,579
I think Chris talked about it, if not in

701
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:13,580
the last lecture.

702
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,582
I think I've seen a talk of him on

703
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:16,583
YouTube.

704
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:17,584
It's lower bounded by the uncertainty

705
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:18,585
principle.

706
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:19,586
Right.

707
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:24,591
For instance, Planck's constant is in

708
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:24,591
units of action, which is energy times

709
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:28,595
time.

710
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:28,595
Right.

711
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:32,599
So Landauer's principle says you need a

712
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:32,599
certain amount of energy to erase

713
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,604
information and you have time.

714
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:37,604
Right.

715
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:40,607
And then you have an energy time and

716
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
certain principle putting those things

717
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
together, you have a minimum amount of

718
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:48,615
action, which is literally the minimum.

719
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:51,617
The action is measuring what I said

720
00:29:51,617 --> 00:29:51,618
earlier.

721
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:51,618
Right.

722
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:53,620
Like differences that make a difference,

723
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,620
the minimum difference that you can make.

724
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,622
.

725
00:29:56,622 --> 00:29:59,626
So the minimum difference to erase a bit

726
00:29:59,626 --> 00:29:59,626
or rewrite it on the boundary, so to

727
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:03,624
speak.

728
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:04,625
Right.

729
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:07,628
So, yeah, that would be given by the

730
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:09,630
uncertain relation, energy times time.

731
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,632
I don't know exactly what the figure is,

732
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:11,632
but it's obviously very small compared to

733
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:13,634
everyday life.

734
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:16,637
Corby: Got it.

735
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,639
And is there work on the upper bound?

736
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:20,641
Like, for example, would it be the number

737
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:22,643
of degrees of freedom on the boundary?

738
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:24,645
Ander: No, I don't think it's bounded

739
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:25,646
from above.

740
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:28,649
But obviously then we do want to bond it

741
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:28,649
from above for technological reasons, if

742
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:32,653
you wish.

743
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:35,656
But I think that is an engineering

744
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:38,659
problem, not one of physics.

745
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:43,664
Daniel: Andre, a few questions on this

746
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:44,665
figure.

747
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,669
What are Y and E?

748
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,673
The blue oval, as Chris has pointed out,

749
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:52,673
is going to consistently be the screen,

750
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:57,678
the blanket.

751
00:30:57,678 --> 00:31:00,675
And so we often associate that with at

752
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:02,677
least some blankets.

753
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:05,680
Include these information gathering and

754
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,682
utilizing systems.

755
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:12,687
So what is happening internal to the

756
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:13,688
agent here?

757
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:16,691
What kind of computation is happening?

758
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:19,694
And is this something that is actually

759
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:21,696
proposed to be occurring?

760
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:24,699
Or is this a schematic or a map of how we

761
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:26,701
could think about something occurring?

762
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,707
Ander: I think this question is going to

763
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:32,707
be better addressed by Chris himself,

764
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:36,710
probably in the next lecture.

765
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:39,714
For now, what I can say is I can

766
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:39,714
reiterate what I was trying to say

767
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:39,714
earlier, which is that what this

768
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:39,714
addresses and this basic measurement

769
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:39,714
picture, so to speak, is the observer

770
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:50,725
effect, right?

771
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:54,729
Like this notion that you cannot observe

772
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:54,729
something without disturbing the

773
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:58,733
environment.

774
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:01,730
So if you then try to make sense of this

775
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:01,730
by constraining from first principles,

776
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:01,730
land hours, principle and so on, basic

777
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:01,730
requirements on information processing

778
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:01,730
from the point of view of energy, then

779
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:01,730
you get that this boundary is constrained

780
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:18,747
in some ways, right?

781
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:22,751
This Y is what's called the memory sector,

782
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:22,751
, meaning that you don't just act on the

783
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:28,757
immediate information that you perceive.

784
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:31,760
You may also act on stuff that's stored

785
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:31,760
that you have perceived before then sure,

786
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:31,760
e, the red part is what you're perceiving

787
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:39,768
right now, the environment.

788
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:43,771
But actually I don't know if I have it in

789
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:43,771
here, but this is further broken up into

790
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:47,776
other parts.

791
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:50,779
So not schematically here, let me try to

792
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:51,780
find it over here.

793
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:05,788
Now, I don't know, actually, bear with me

794
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:06,789
for a second.

795
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:07,790
I think you might be here.

796
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:21,804
That's the same picture anyways.

797
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:24,807
I don't want to waste time by trying to

798
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:24,807
find it, but back to the original picture

799
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:27,810
sure.

800
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,813
What you're measuring, and again, Chris

801
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:30,813
will talk about this in more detail, but

802
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:30,813
from first principle assumptions, they

803
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:30,813
deduce that you're going to have to

804
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:30,813
deploy your finite resources for

805
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:30,813
gathering information in clever ways on

806
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:46,828
the boundary, right?

807
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:49,832
So you're going to have to deploy some

808
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:49,832
resources for memory, some resources as a

809
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:54,837
heat sink, right?

810
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:56,838
So you're going to be processing

811
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:56,838
information, you're going to be dumping

812
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:56,838
so called low quality stuff into the

813
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:56,838
environment, you're going to be dumping

814
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:56,838
heat and then other than the memory, you'

815
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:56,838
're going to be focusing on what's going

816
00:33:56,838 --> 00:34:09,846
on right now in this environment.

817
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:12,849
And what I wanted to say is that it can

818
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:12,849
be further broken up into what's called

819
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:17,854
pointer and reference sectors.

820
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:20,857
So you can imagine this e sector here has

821
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:20,857
to be broken into further sectors because

822
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:20,857
then there is the other first principle

823
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:26,863
notion.

824
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:26,863
Okay?

825
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:29,866
So what does it mean to observe

826
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:30,867
something?

827
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:32,868
The differences that make a difference,

828
00:34:32,868 --> 00:34:32,869
right?

829
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:36,873
So there is only information with context,

830
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:37,874
, right?

831
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:39,875
There is no information per se.

832
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:40,877
It's all semantics, right?

833
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:43,880
So you only observe things in context.

834
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,883
So some things are going to have to stay

835
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
the same, namely reference states here,

836
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
and some things are going to bear,

837
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:51,888
right?

838
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:53,890
So you can think of this as the gauge in

839
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:54,891
your car, right?

840
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:57,894
Obviously the circle stays the same and

841
00:34:57,894 --> 00:34:57,894
that's your context, so to speak, with

842
00:34:57,894 --> 00:35:02,893
the numbers in it.

843
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,895
They never go away, they stay the same.

844
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,897
But as you speed up or down, the gauge is

845
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:07,898
going to change.

846
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,900
And that's how you know only in that

847
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:09,900
context you can tell your own speed when

848
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,904
you're driving a car, right?

849
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,907
So anyways, this is just a teaser for

850
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:17,908
things to come.

851
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:20,911
We can go back to more questions.

852
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:21,912
Daniel, what do you think?

853
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,914
I'll pick maybe two or three more over

854
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:24,915
here.

855
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:26,917
Yeah.

856
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,919
Daniel: Pick another question, or anyone

857
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:28,919
raising their hand, or if anyone in the

858
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:28,919
live chat wants to write something, I'll

859
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:32,923
read it.

860
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,926
How about the WIC rotation?

861
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,929
Could you summarize what the WIC rotation

862
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:38,929
is and then state this question about

863
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,931
it?

864
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,935
Ander: That's a great question.

865
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,937
I wish I knew the answer better.

866
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,940
But formally speaking, the Wick rotation

867
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:49,940
is just so Chris said, you take a

868
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:49,940
quantity multiply by I square root of

869
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:58,949
negative one.

870
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:01,946
That amounts to a 90 degree rotation in a

871
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:02,947
complex plane.

872
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:02,947
Fine.

873
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:05,949
Now, that appears to be a trick.

874
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,953
And what it does effectively is take you

875
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:08,953
from quantum mechanics to statistical

876
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:14,958
mechanics, roughly speaking.

877
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:20,965
Now, why it works, I have no clue.

878
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:22,967
I don't know the answer myself.

879
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:25,970
But now when things appear to be a trick

880
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:25,970
and they get you something, maybe there's

881
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:25,970
more to it than what's apparent at first,

882
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:36,981
but I myself don't know the answer.

883
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:40,985
It's a very good question, but I do think

884
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:40,985
it may have to do with the fact that on

885
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:40,985
the one hand, quantum and statistical

886
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:40,985
mechanics both are talking about

887
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:40,985
constraints on information processing,

888
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:57,002
maybe from different perspectives.

889
00:36:57,002 --> 00:37:00,999
But again, that's just speculation on my

890
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:00,999
end, so it's maybe a way of relating the

891
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,002
two.

892
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:07,006
Daniel: Could we just review just read

893
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:09,008
Chris's full answer to this.

894
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:12,011
Read the question, and then Chris's full

895
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:13,012
answer.

896
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:17,016
Ander: Does the weak rotation to ask that

897
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:17,016
matter energy somehow exists 90 degrees

898
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:17,016
perpendicular to a three dimensional

899
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:21,020
space?

900
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:31,030
Daniel: And then I'll just read Chris's

901
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,030
answer.

902
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,031
Then anyone?

903
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:33,032
Please raise your hand if you want to add

904
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:34,033
something more on this.

905
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:36,035
He wrote, in a sense, yes, time is

906
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:36,035
perpendicular to our three dimensions of

907
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:40,039
space, matter, and energy.

908
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:42,041
We ourselves exist in time.

909
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,042
Wick is pointing to the intimate

910
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:43,042
relationship between how we measure time

911
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:43,042
and how we determine or judge that

912
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:43,042
something maintains its identity through

913
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:49,048
time.

914
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:50,049
I e.

915
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:52,051
Stays the same thing through time.

916
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:54,053
To tell time by a clock, I have to be

917
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:54,053
sure I'm looking at the same clock set

918
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:58,057
the same way, et cetera.

919
00:37:58,057 --> 00:38:01,054
We'll get to this in July and August.

920
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,063
Could you connect this, Andrew, to some

921
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:10,063
of the semantic information flows

922
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:10,063
discussed in Live stream 17 or any of the

923
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:10,063
other cone co cone diagrams from the

924
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:24,077
papers that you showed earlier?

925
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:26,079
Ander: Sure.

926
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,083
Again, I have to preface it by saying

927
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:30,083
that I am working on understanding it

928
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:30,083
myself, but just from small email

929
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:30,083
exchange that I had with Chris ant waste

930
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:30,083
in this paper, one can sort of see that

931
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:30,083
it's related to the picture I was showing

932
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:50,103
earlier, namely this one.

933
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:51,104
Right.

934
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:55,108
But let's scroll down a little bit to

935
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:58,111
page to page 23 24.

936
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:00,107
Here they talk out with rotation again.

937
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:09,116
So I think it has it has to do with, at

938
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
least from what I heard from crazy email,

939
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
has to do with this notion of local time,

940
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
the definition of local time in this

941
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
observation picture, and the fact that

942
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:28,135
you rotate 90.

943
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:32,139
Degrees twice, you get the opposite sign,

944
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:33,140
basically, right?

945
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,144
So the local time, effectively, that's

946
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:37,144
going to ensure that the picture is

947
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:37,144
symmetric and that the flow is going to

948
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:37,144
be opposite in the direction towards the

949
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:50,157
observer and towards the environment.

950
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:57,164
Daniel: Okay, Alexey, then.

951
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:59,166
Anyone else raising their hands?

952
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:02,163
Ali: I am struggling to understand and

953
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:02,163
part of my difficulty bear with me for

954
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:02,163
being so kind of but I remember Sean

955
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:02,163
Carroll's lecture on time in different

956
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:02,163
versions of physics, and it took a whole

957
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:12,173
hour.

958
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:14,175
So are we talking Newtonian time, which

959
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:15,176
is universally the same?

960
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:18,179
Are we talking relative time

961
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:19,180
philosophically?

962
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,182
Are we talking about people who believe

963
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:21,182
that only present here and now is real,

964
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:26,187
while future and past do not exist?

965
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:29,190
So when we say time is perpendicular too,

966
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:29,190
my sense is that just like Chris

967
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:29,190
mentioned in the lecture, we're

968
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:34,195
reinventing the time.

969
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:36,197
We're creating a new definition by

970
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:36,197
calling it the same word we're all

971
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:39,200
familiar with.

972
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,202
And that creates some dissonance where I

973
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:41,202
just think that maybe we need to kind of

974
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:46,207
say that this is something new.

975
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:48,209
And if it's not something new, then which

976
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:48,209
version of the time are we talking

977
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:50,211
about?

978
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:52,213
Einsteinian, Newtonian or whatever?

979
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:56,216
It's a simple question before we say it's

980
00:40:56,216 --> 00:40:56,216
perpendicular, do people agree that

981
00:40:56,216 --> 00:41:00,215
future is real or not?

982
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,222
Daniel: I'll give it all on this, Alexey.

983
00:41:07,222 --> 00:41:07,222
.

984
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:12,227
Again, speculation neither here nor then.

985
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:12,227
.

986
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:16,231
If we take Chris seriously, that

987
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
communication is an ontological primary

988
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
and that rather than putting

989
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
communications protocols in some sort of

990
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
time newtonian time, Einsteinian time,

991
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
these are these different time concepts,

992
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
these different scaffolds that then

993
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
communication gets inscribed within or

994
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:37,252
stretched within.

995
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:40,255
But if we start with a topological

996
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:40,255
understanding of communication rather

997
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:40,255
than a geometric understanding of

998
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:40,255
spacetime so the topology of the blanket

999
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:40,255
and the observer in their sensorium, then

1000
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:40,255
different kinds of cognitive agents,

1001
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:40,255
ranging from what we would call nonliving

1002
00:41:40,255 --> 00:42:00,269
to what we could call living.

1003
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,272
They depending on their cognitive

1004
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:03,272
sophistication are able to create or

1005
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:09,278
project different time concepts.

1006
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:13,282
Time concepts that are not useful will

1007
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:13,282
lead to their own material dissolution,

1008
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:13,282
the failure to maintain that kind of

1009
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:13,282
cognitive sophistication, which requires

1010
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:13,282
not just information gathering and

1011
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:13,282
utilization, but also energy gathering

1012
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:26,295
and utilization.

1013
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:30,299
And so when you have multiple agents who

1014
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
are whether you conceptualize them as

1015
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
within a message passing relationship and

1016
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
having no surprise on the clock on the

1017
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
wall, then they're like in a local time

1018
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:45,314
synchrony.

1019
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:50,319
But the primary case is one entity

1020
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:50,319
engaging with its sensorium and itself

1021
00:42:50,319 --> 00:43:01,324
modeling time in terms of progression.

1022
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:06,329
And so these previous time concepts and

1023
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:06,329
these different attempts to kind of

1024
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:06,329
survey the structure of space time

1025
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:06,329
reflect different cognitive models that

1026
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:06,329
cognitive agents have proposed for time

1027
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:06,329
and that communication actually takes

1028
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:06,329
ontological primacy over all of these

1029
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:06,329
ramified, potentially overlapping,

1030
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:06,329
potentially non overlapping time concepts.

1031
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:33,356
.

1032
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:39,362
But they're downstream of agents

1033
00:43:39,362 --> 00:43:42,365
cognitive models, not vice versa.

1034
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:45,368
I'm not sure it's how I interpreted what

1035
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:45,368
Chris said about communication being an

1036
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:49,372
ontological primary, though.

1037
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:55,378
Ali: So if we take one instance of a

1038
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
COVID-19 virus, a single kind of instance,

1039
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
, right, it's got no memory and no

1040
00:43:55,378 --> 00:44:00,377
ability to plan.

1041
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:03,380
Is there a local time for that virus

1042
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:03,380
versus humanity observing how the virus

1043
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:08,385
spreads across the globe?

1044
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:11,388
And we have agents with memory and

1045
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:12,389
planning.

1046
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,393
Is there time relative to a single

1047
00:44:16,393 --> 00:44:17,393
photon?

1048
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:21,398
My hunch is that there's a possibility

1049
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:21,398
that we're simply inventing something

1050
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:21,398
brand new and defining it brand new and

1051
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:21,398
they draw in parallel back to all these

1052
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:28,405
other times.

1053
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:30,407
I understand the effort, but.

1054
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:34,411
Ander: Is that.

1055
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:35,412
Ali: A brand new time?

1056
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:36,413
Is it some other kind of time?

1057
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:37,414
I don't know.

1058
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:39,416
Ander: Daniel.

1059
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:40,417
Can I say words?

1060
00:44:41,418 --> 00:44:43,420
So I understand Alexis question, and I

1061
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
think it's sort of related to, at least

1062
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
morally speaking, to your concern about

1063
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:51,428
different kinds of entropy, right?

1064
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,433
And what I can say is that also they have

1065
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:59,436
Glazebrook, Marciano and so on.

1066
00:44:59,436 --> 00:45:03,434
They have this recent paper on quantum

1067
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:03,434
error correction, so I have yet to read

1068
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:10,441
it and take a closer look.

1069
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:13,444
But here they talk about space time,

1070
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,445
right?

1071
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,448
And my punch to address Alex's question

1072
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:17,448
is that if you could sort of recover the

1073
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:17,448
more familiar notions of time in a

1074
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:17,448
correspondence principle sort of way by

1075
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:17,448
taking some Newtonian limit or H bar goes

1076
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:17,448
to zero or speed of Glycos infinity and

1077
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:37,468
so on, that would be very satisfactory.

1078
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:40,471
Sure, they may be doing a new thing, but

1079
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:40,471
recovering old stuff in the new thing is

1080
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:44,475
a good sanity check.

1081
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,478
And so long as we can see that being

1082
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,480
worked out, I think I'd be very happy.

1083
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:55,486
Daniel: And just to the virus point, I

1084
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:55,486
would argue that viruses, through their

1085
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:55,486
physical engagement, they do have memory,

1086
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:55,486
but they don't necessarily have the

1087
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:55,486
awareness or metacognition on that memory,

1088
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:55,486
, except as granted by intergenerational

1089
00:45:55,486 --> 00:46:12,497
evolutionary type pressure.

1090
00:46:13,497 --> 00:46:17,502
But they do have past events modifying

1091
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:22,506
them within some set of possibilities.

1092
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:28,513
So they're just being them and their

1093
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:30,515
internal time.

1094
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:34,519
There isn't a cognitive observer

1095
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
necessarily.

1096
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:37,522
Ander: In.

1097
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:39,524
Daniel: Terms of like a narrative.

1098
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:44,528
I I am watching the clock, but they do

1099
00:46:44,528 --> 00:46:45,530
change.

1100
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:52,537
But it's certainly very provocative if

1101
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:53,538
this is not.

1102
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:56,541
Or we could also look to Kronos and

1103
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:56,541
Cairos and about the relationship of time

1104
00:46:56,541 --> 00:47:02,541
and timeliness and agentic time.

1105
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:07,546
And then at this point, are we stretching

1106
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:07,546
just this one four letter word too far,

1107
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:07,546
just like we brought up with information

1108
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:13,552
entropy?

1109
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:17,556
Can we think about these as kind of like

1110
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:17,556
continents and then just if someone said,

1111
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:17,556
I visited this continent, you know that

1112
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:17,556
you need to specify a lot more, or what

1113
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:17,556
granularity are these topics corby and

1114
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:30,569
then anyone else raising their hands?

1115
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:33,572
Ander: Yeah.

1116
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:35,574
Corby: On this topic, for a Markov

1117
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:38,577
blanket, you have a transition matrix.

1118
00:47:39,577 --> 00:47:41,580
My question is, how are you allowed to

1119
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:41,580
increment that transition matrix to

1120
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:46,585
calculate a future state?

1121
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:49,588
What does that mean in terms of time?

1122
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:52,591
Are you only allowed to increment it by

1123
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
the lower bound time, which is h over Ln

1124
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:56,595
and kBT.

1125
00:47:58,597 --> 00:48:00,593
Does that question make sense?

1126
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:04,597
Daniel: I'll give a first pass on this.

1127
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:06,599
We have discrete time and continuous time

1128
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:08,601
models in Active Inference.

1129
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:11,604
For a discrete time model where you have

1130
00:48:11,604 --> 00:48:11,604
the B transition matrix, then the choice

1131
00:48:11,604 --> 00:48:17,610
of Delta T is a modeler's decision.

1132
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,612
And we talked about this a lot in live

1133
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:19,612
stream 52 on accelerated optimization,

1134
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:19,612
there's some Delta T that's like, going

1135
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:19,612
to get you the most accelerated

1136
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:26,619
optimization.

1137
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:29,622
If you have too small of Delta T, then

1138
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:29,622
you're either oversampling or you're

1139
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:29,622
maybe even physically unrealistic like

1140
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:34,627
you pointed to.

1141
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:37,629
Or if you have some long Delta T, you're

1142
00:48:37,629 --> 00:48:37,629
also not making an informative simulation

1143
00:48:37,629 --> 00:48:37,629
in the discrete time case where you're

1144
00:48:37,629 --> 00:48:42,635
explicitly making time steps.

1145
00:48:43,636 --> 00:48:45,638
Contrast with the continuous time

1146
00:48:45,638 --> 00:48:45,638
generative model, where we're doing more

1147
00:48:45,638 --> 00:48:45,638
of a Taylor series expansion on the

1148
00:48:45,638 --> 00:48:45,638
generalized coordinates, at which point

1149
00:48:45,638 --> 00:48:54,647
Delta T is not required.

1150
00:48:55,647 --> 00:48:57,650
You're merely just taking an extended

1151
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:57,650
approximation from a given snapshot, and

1152
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:02,649
so Delta T doesn't even come into play.

1153
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:05,652
Corby: Got it.

1154
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:07,654
Okay, that makes sense.

1155
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:10,657
I don't know how it ties into time, but

1156
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:12,659
it helps clarify a little bit.

1157
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:17,664
Daniel: Okay.

1158
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:20,667
Anyone else can raise their hand or under

1159
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:20,667
kind of maybe one more question or one

1160
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:25,672
more topic from a paper?

1161
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:29,676
Just what's one more puzzle piece that

1162
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:29,676
you think gives us a first coat of paint

1163
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:29,676
from questions submitted or from one of

1164
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:38,685
these papers that you have up?

1165
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:42,689
What's something that helps us connect

1166
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:43,690
the dots a little bit?

1167
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:47,694
Ander: I don't think I have a good answer.

1168
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:47,694
.

1169
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:53,700
Let me look at the questions again

1170
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,703
regarding time.

1171
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:59,706
I'll just reiterate what I said as I look

1172
00:49:59,706 --> 00:49:59,706
over these questions, which is that I

1173
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:05,706
believe Chris will address it.

1174
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:10,710
I don't know if you can see what I'm

1175
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:10,710
sharing on the screen, but the paper,

1176
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:10,710
whose title is Communication Protocols

1177
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:10,710
blah blah blah from March of this year

1178
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:19,720
does talk about spacetime.

1179
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,723
It's a quantum error correction code, and

1180
00:50:22,723 --> 00:50:22,723
to me personally, it'd be nice to see if

1181
00:50:22,723 --> 00:50:27,728
that can be more familiar.

1182
00:50:28,728 --> 00:50:30,731
Notions of time, such as special

1183
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:30,731
relativity can be recovered as limits in

1184
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:35,736
correspondence principles.

1185
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,742
Do you want me to say anything else?

1186
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:48,749
Daniel: If anyone could even just

1187
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:48,749
summarize what are these codes referring

1188
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:51,752
to?

1189
00:50:52,753 --> 00:50:54,755
Or how are these codes one and the same

1190
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:57,757
as communication protocols?

1191
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:01,756
Or are they related to the blanket and

1192
00:51:01,756 --> 00:51:04,759
the heat that was being output as waste?

1193
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:09,764
What will these codes allow us to do

1194
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:11,766
better if we understood them more?

1195
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:16,771
Ander: I don't know that I can answer

1196
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:17,772
that right now.

1197
00:51:17,772 --> 00:51:19,774
I don't think they understand the

1198
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:20,775
question.

1199
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:23,778
Yeah, I just don't know.

1200
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,781
Sorry.

1201
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:32,787
Daniel: Terry.

1202
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:34,789
And then anyone else raising their hands.

1203
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:34,789
.

1204
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:39,794
Ross: I'm not a physicist.

1205
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:41,796
I don't understand maths at all.

1206
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:48,803
But what attracted me to this idea of

1207
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:48,803
physics as information processing is that

1208
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:48,803
it feels like at a base level, whatever

1209
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:48,803
the unknowable external state is, it

1210
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:48,803
could be perceived as made up of

1211
00:51:48,803 --> 00:52:09,818
information.

1212
00:52:09,818 --> 00:52:11,820
You know, we we kind of think of

1213
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:11,820
ourselves living in a particulate

1214
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:11,820
universe, but at a base level there are

1215
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:11,820
these and stop me if I'm just talking 14

1216
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:11,820
year old nonsense here, but this notion

1217
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:11,820
of quantum fields, they feel like

1218
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:28,837
informational fields.

1219
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:34,843
And that the concept of physics is purely

1220
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:34,843
information that we then interpret as a

1221
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:34,843
physical universe which we inhabit

1222
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:34,843
because we can't see beyond our Markov

1223
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:50,859
blanket.

1224
00:52:53,862 --> 00:52:57,866
I find this a really exciting idea.

1225
00:52:58,866 --> 00:52:58,867
Dean: That.

1226
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:03,866
Ross: Whenever you start to think of the

1227
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
surprisal as the variational free energy

1228
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
between sort of your prior and your

1229
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
posterior, if you start to think of that

1230
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
variational free energy, not as energy

1231
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:18,880
but as an information gap.

1232
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:20,883
So that if you see the energy as actual

1233
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:20,883
because energy, when you think of energy

1234
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:20,883
in physics terms, it's kind of this

1235
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:20,883
magical thing that allows work to happen.

1236
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:29,892
.

1237
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:31,894
But what is it?

1238
00:53:31,894 --> 00:53:34,897
We've got a term for it.

1239
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:38,901
Is it jewels or whatever?

1240
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:41,904
But what does it mean?

1241
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:42,905
It has this magical property.

1242
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:45,908
But if you think of it as information,

1243
00:53:45,908 --> 00:53:48,911
then it starts to make sense.

1244
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:52,915
So variational free energy starts to be

1245
00:53:52,915 --> 00:53:52,915
seen as a difference in information

1246
00:53:52,915 --> 00:54:00,917
between your prior and your posterior.

1247
00:54:02,919 --> 00:54:05,922
So whenever you start to think about time,

1248
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
, time is this conceptual metric that we

1249
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:11,928
use almost because we have memory.

1250
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:17,934
And I wonder if we are getting trapped in

1251
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:19,936
this semantics.

1252
00:54:20,937 --> 00:54:23,940
And all I have is English because I don't

1253
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,942
understand the maths really.

1254
00:54:25,942 --> 00:54:28,945
But you guys come in here and you do

1255
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:28,945
understand the maths and then you convert

1256
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:28,945
it into English, which I think I

1257
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:34,951
understand.

1258
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:38,955
And then I can think of it like a kid in

1259
00:54:38,955 --> 00:54:38,955
a sweetie shop or a physics class at 14

1260
00:54:38,955 --> 00:54:42,959
years of age.

1261
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,962
I don't really know what I'm saying.

1262
00:54:45,962 --> 00:54:46,963
I don't know what I'm saying.

1263
00:54:46,963 --> 00:54:50,967
But at a fundamental level, everything

1264
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:50,967
that we're talking about is I can

1265
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:55,972
understand it as information.

1266
00:54:55,972 --> 00:54:59,976
And I'm excited to see how things develop.

1267
00:54:59,976 --> 00:54:59,976
.

1268
00:54:59,976 --> 00:55:01,972
What are your thoughts on this

1269
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:02,973
craziness?

1270
00:55:05,976 --> 00:55:08,979
Daniel: So many great pieces in there.

1271
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:13,984
Physics as information processing.

1272
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:16,987
What is it that actually allows the steam

1273
00:55:16,987 --> 00:55:19,990
engine to run and the ball to move?

1274
00:55:20,991 --> 00:55:21,992
That kind of physics.

1275
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:25,996
And then as the timeline laid out, also

1276
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:25,996
occurring during a period of immense

1277
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:25,996
technology and apparatus development and

1278
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:25,996
digitization and all of this and

1279
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:36,007
unconventional computing as well.

1280
00:55:37,008 --> 00:55:40,011
It's almost like this materialist dualism

1281
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:40,011
that instead of with mind and body that

1282
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:40,011
there was some kind of dualism between

1283
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:40,011
the types of forces and energies and ways

1284
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:40,011
of thinking about what made the steam

1285
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:40,011
engine work and then what makes a

1286
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:53,024
computer work.

1287
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:56,027
And so you'd understand how the computer

1288
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:56,027
could fall off a cliff, but then you

1289
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:56,027
wouldn't necessarily be able to use that

1290
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:56,027
exact kind of mechanics and physics and

1291
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:56,027
dynamics to study like how the computer

1292
00:55:56,027 --> 00:56:05,030
operated.

1293
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,032
But you could say it weighed eleven

1294
00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:07,032
pounds.

1295
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:11,036
And so I think the provocation, which is

1296
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
as you hinted towards first off, would be

1297
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
awesome to have a natural language math

1298
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:20,045
and graphical synthesis the triple play.

1299
00:56:20,045 --> 00:56:24,049
But also then to use a common approach to

1300
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
understanding this and what wasn't

1301
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
working or is not proposed to work, is

1302
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
trying to fit information into that non

1303
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:39,064
cognitive universe.

1304
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:42,067
But rather if we take the cognitive

1305
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
primacy of communication, then all of

1306
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
these forces as inferred by the sensorium,

1307
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
, which is all we're ever going to have,

1308
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
totally the most valid first principles

1309
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:55,080
constraint to make.

1310
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,083
Maybe then we'll be able to have a lot

1311
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:58,083
more synthesis about even how steam

1312
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:58,083
engines work when we understand that we'

1313
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:58,083
're bound in that inference by our

1314
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:58,083
sensorium and all that comes along with

1315
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:58,083
that and the variational free energy

1316
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:58,083
bounding surprise on our generative model.

1317
00:56:58,083 --> 00:57:12,091
.

1318
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:15,094
Dean.

1319
00:57:19,098 --> 00:57:22,101
Dean: I'm going to come at this from the

1320
00:57:22,101 --> 00:57:22,101
position of a 14 year old lens because I

1321
00:57:22,101 --> 00:57:22,101
don't think there's anything unique about

1322
00:57:22,101 --> 00:57:28,107
that.

1323
00:57:28,107 --> 00:57:32,111
I think on the most basic level, what I

1324
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:32,111
took away from Chris's lecture was that

1325
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:32,111
there's information processing of at

1326
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:40,119
least two types.

1327
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:44,123
One is figuring it out, as in figure five

1328
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:44,123
or any of these other figures that are up

1329
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:44,123
on the screen right now, or anything that

1330
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:54,133
stabilizes the world around us.

1331
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:57,136
I think examples have come up in this

1332
00:57:57,136 --> 00:57:57,136
conversation already of topology or

1333
00:57:57,136 --> 00:58:00,133
geometry.

1334
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:03,136
There's a second type of information

1335
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
processing which is outing the figure

1336
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:07,140
type of information which is searching.

1337
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:11,144
And I think Alexey used the expression

1338
00:58:11,144 --> 00:58:13,146
which time are we talking about?

1339
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:15,148
So these two types of processes are quite

1340
00:58:15,148 --> 00:58:16,149
different.

1341
00:58:16,149 --> 00:58:19,152
If you do a comparative analysis of the

1342
00:58:19,152 --> 00:58:19,152
two, you have information practicing and

1343
00:58:19,152 --> 00:58:19,152
you have to have both of the processes to

1344
00:58:19,152 --> 00:58:19,152
really get a sense conceptually of what

1345
00:58:19,152 --> 00:58:19,152
it is that communication is really

1346
00:58:19,152 --> 00:58:32,165
talking about.

1347
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:36,169
If you are information practicing your

1348
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:36,169
wayfinding until you collapse to

1349
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:36,169
something we might describe in a verb

1350
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:36,169
tense as way found it's in the quantizing

1351
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:36,169
of that invariant state, that vast ocean,

1352
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:48,181
if you want to think of it.

1353
00:58:48,181 --> 00:58:52,185
Metaphorically out to all horizons on the

1354
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:52,185
manifold into a variant or a nuanced or a

1355
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:52,185
discretized or an orientation type of

1356
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:52,185
state where all of a sudden things like

1357
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:52,185
currents and temperature shifts and even

1358
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:52,185
things that we've applied labels to, like

1359
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:52,185
entropy and a transition matrix suddenly

1360
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:52,185
appear out of the seeming nothingness or

1361
00:58:52,185 --> 00:59:19,206
the invariance.

1362
00:59:19,206 --> 00:59:22,209
So that's not the math, but that's kind

1363
00:59:22,209 --> 00:59:22,209
of stepping back and saying what is the

1364
00:59:22,209 --> 00:59:27,214
math trying to say?

1365
00:59:27,214 --> 00:59:30,217
I think it boils down to the comparative

1366
00:59:30,217 --> 00:59:31,218
analysis.

1367
00:59:31,218 --> 00:59:34,221
And then I'm hoping that in the coming

1368
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
lectures, chris starts opening that up

1369
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
and doing kind of the back and forth

1370
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
between the two types of figuring it out

1371
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:45,232
and outing the figures.

1372
00:59:45,232 --> 00:59:48,234
Because I think when both are part of the

1373
00:59:48,234 --> 00:59:48,234
conversation, that's when we start to get

1374
00:59:48,234 --> 00:59:53,240
a sense of what's really going on.

1375
01:00:01,339 --> 01:00:02,374
Daniel: Thank you.

1376
01:00:02,556 --> 01:00:05,716
In this sort of closing sessions,

1377
01:00:05,716 --> 01:00:05,716
especially if anyone hasn't added

1378
01:00:05,716 --> 01:00:05,716
anything, please feel free to give any

1379
01:00:05,716 --> 01:00:16,744
last reflections or questions arising.

1380
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:21,223
So first, as many people as would like

1381
01:00:21,223 --> 01:00:23,462
can reflect that way.

1382
01:00:24,571 --> 01:00:27,876
And then after every hand has been

1383
01:00:27,876 --> 01:00:27,876
addressed, then ander if you could just

1384
01:00:27,876 --> 01:00:34,505
give us a kind of look ahead.

1385
01:00:34,516 --> 01:00:37,798
So Avel first, then Anyone else with just

1386
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:37,798
where does this discussion take us and

1387
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:37,798
where do you want to continue to learn

1388
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:43,449
more about Avel?

1389
01:00:45,669 --> 01:00:47,808
Avel: So, two things.

1390
01:00:47,816 --> 01:00:49,083
First, if I walk out of here without

1391
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:49,083
understanding what is coconut, I will be

1392
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:53,490
disappointed.

1393
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:59,009
And I don't actually expect it to happen

1394
01:00:59,009 --> 01:01:00,568
in like 12 hours.

1395
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:02,747
That seems like it's something.

1396
01:01:02,765 --> 01:01:05,081
But more seriously, I can agree with that

1397
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:05,081
difficulty that there is a unity between

1398
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:05,081
physical structure and communication

1399
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:05,081
protocols and that communication

1400
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:05,081
protocols are quantum reference frame,

1401
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:05,081
kind of individuate physical states,

1402
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:05,081
individuate meaningful measurement

1403
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:05,081
outcomes that are ray file as physical

1404
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:27,211
possibilities.

1405
01:01:27,245 --> 01:01:29,490
But the question is then where do

1406
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:29,490
communication protocols, quantum

1407
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:34,935
merchants frame come from?

1408
01:01:34,952 --> 01:01:37,257
Like, what are the physical determinants

1409
01:01:37,257 --> 01:01:39,493
that bring about those things?

1410
01:01:40,511 --> 01:01:42,744
And that seems like a question that could

1411
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:42,744
be addressed at the conceptual level of

1412
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:45,004
this course.

1413
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:50,052
And I would like I saw the live stream 17,

1414
01:01:50,052 --> 01:01:52,077
, so that did not help.

1415
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:57,122
Anyway, I would like to have more grip

1416
01:01:57,122 --> 01:01:57,122
into that if we can address it in the

1417
01:01:57,122 --> 01:02:02,119
foreign courses.

1418
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:03,128
Ander: Thank you.

1419
01:02:05,142 --> 01:02:06,152
Daniel: Thank you.

1420
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:10,198
Anyone else?

1421
01:02:10,198 --> 01:02:14,234
Especially if they haven't added anything

1422
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:14,234
yet, want to give kind of a closing

1423
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:18,274
thought?

1424
01:02:31,402 --> 01:02:33,425
Yeah, there's a lot to learn and Chris

1425
01:02:33,425 --> 01:02:33,425
brings up a lot in his lecture, even

1426
01:02:33,425 --> 01:02:37,463
though we've only had one.

1427
01:02:37,464 --> 01:02:42,511
It's one of the denser hours of epistemic

1428
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:45,542
resourcing that I've seen.

1429
01:02:45,547 --> 01:02:48,576
And there's also all of these accessory

1430
01:02:48,576 --> 01:02:48,576
and cutting edge works that under showing.

1431
01:02:48,576 --> 01:02:51,608
.

1432
01:02:52,616 --> 01:02:55,643
So I'm really looking forward to how we

1433
01:02:55,643 --> 01:02:55,643
can continue to curate and improve the

1434
01:02:55,643 --> 01:02:55,643
questions that we have so that the

1435
01:02:55,643 --> 01:02:55,643
uncertainties in our generative model

1436
01:02:55,643 --> 01:03:05,687
that we have, how would this be useful?

1437
01:03:05,688 --> 01:03:06,697
What does this mean?

1438
01:03:06,697 --> 01:03:08,714
Why is this variable this way?

1439
01:03:08,715 --> 01:03:10,733
What is the implication for that?

1440
01:03:10,734 --> 01:03:13,766
Those are all the great questions and let'

1441
01:03:13,766 --> 01:03:13,766
's just get them inscribed on our

1442
01:03:13,766 --> 01:03:13,766
classical documents so that we can have

1443
01:03:13,766 --> 01:03:13,766
other quantum cognitive agents reduce

1444
01:03:13,766 --> 01:03:13,766
their uncertainty by looking at the

1445
01:03:13,766 --> 01:03:25,885
responses.

1446
01:03:26,895 --> 01:03:30,929
So with that under, if you could just

1447
01:03:30,929 --> 01:03:30,929
look ahead to lecture two and just point

1448
01:03:30,929 --> 01:03:37,004
towards where we're going to be going.

1449
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:44,073
Ander: Yes, lecture two will, I think

1450
01:03:44,073 --> 01:03:44,073
from what I hear from Chris, is going to

1451
01:03:44,073 --> 01:03:44,073
start to address these basic ontological

1452
01:03:44,073 --> 01:03:54,174
aspects of the quantum measurement.

1453
01:03:54,175 --> 01:03:58,218
So the two sources to look at would be

1454
01:03:58,218 --> 01:03:58,218
two papers, mainly this one, Physical

1455
01:03:58,218 --> 01:04:07,240
Meaning of Holographic Principle.

1456
01:04:07,245 --> 01:04:09,268
This one's, by far the most pedagogical

1457
01:04:09,268 --> 01:04:10,271
one.

1458
01:04:10,272 --> 01:04:12,299
So if I had to suggest that books look at

1459
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:14,317
one, it would be this one.

1460
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:17,349
It's very easy to read, I think, but

1461
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:17,349
maybe for a bit more detail there's the

1462
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:17,349
slightly older one and they talk at

1463
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:17,349
length about Cocoa and the headgrounds

1464
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:17,349
here, Free Energy Principle for Generic

1465
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:32,497
Content Systems.

1466
01:04:33,499 --> 01:04:35,522
So I think that's what's going to come in

1467
01:04:35,522 --> 01:04:36,534
these two lectures.

1468
01:04:36,534 --> 01:04:39,565
Basically, the main ideas behind these

1469
01:04:39,565 --> 01:04:39,565
two papers and yeah, that's all I have to

1470
01:04:39,565 --> 01:04:43,603
say.

1471
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:49,659
Daniel: All right, well, thank you for

1472
01:04:49,659 --> 01:04:51,688
all who joined this first discussion.

1473
01:04:52,691 --> 01:04:55,727
Hope that it was fun for you and for the

1474
01:04:55,727 --> 01:04:56,736
audience.

1475
01:04:57,741 --> 01:05:00,711
And check out the course site for the

1476
01:05:00,711 --> 01:05:00,711
readings to get ahead of the second

1477
01:05:00,711 --> 01:05:03,747
lecture.

1478
01:05:03,748 --> 01:05:07,786
We'll all watch the second lecture and

1479
01:05:07,786 --> 01:05:07,786
come back in about a month for the second

1480
01:05:07,786 --> 01:05:13,840
discussion.

1481
01:05:13,841 --> 01:05:15,861
Everyone's welcome to join, and the

1482
01:05:15,861 --> 01:05:15,861
website has the registration information.

1483
01:05:15,861 --> 01:05:17,884
.

1484
01:05:17,886 --> 01:05:20,911
And so now that we've seen a little bit

1485
01:05:20,911 --> 01:05:20,911
of one way, it can be we may do something

1486
01:05:20,911 --> 01:05:20,911
similar or we may do something different

1487
01:05:20,911 --> 01:05:27,981
for the second discussion.

1488
01:05:27,983 --> 01:05:29,003
So thanks again, everybody.

1489
01:05:29,005 --> 01:05:30,015
See you later.

1490
01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:31,022
Ander: Bye.
