00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,676
Hello and welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:07,858 --> 00:00:10,364
It's June 3, 2023.

3
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:16,584
We're in the first discussion section for Physics as Information Processing course with Chris Fields.

4
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:20,872
So welcome to all who are here on and off camera.

5
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:26,904
Really exciting to see so many people joining for this participatory discussion section.

6
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:41,588
So in this first interval, we're going to go to anyone who raises their hand, and it would be awesome to hear from everyone who would like to share what excites them about what they heard in the first lecture.

7
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:47,348
How has their background and journey led to them joining?

8
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:53,770
What are they hoping to learn and do in this course?

9
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,060
So firsT hand we'll get to go, maybe.

10
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,880
Ander, you can actually start first, just speaking as a normal participant.

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,850
And then meanwhile, anyone is welcome to raise their hands.

12
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,384
That sounds good.

13
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:18,836
So I am a mathematician by training, but I've always been interested in the more physics side of things.

14
00:01:19,018 --> 00:01:28,180
And in particular, I followed Chris's work pretty closely since probably 2019.

15
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,490
I'm just very interested in the whole ontology of quantum measurement, what it means.

16
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,890
I feel like very often when it's taught in physics classes, it's hand waved away.

17
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:59,244
And even though I myself subscribe to the philosophy of shut up and compute, sometimes not everything you need to do a little bit of philosophy, maybe, and this may be one of the things where you need to do it and you need to address it from first principles.

18
00:01:59,292 --> 00:01:59,456
Right?

19
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:00,928
And I think Chris is doing that.

20
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:03,712
So I'm just here to learn more.

21
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:06,290
And yeah, that's basically it.

22
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,220
Awesome.

23
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,270
I'll just go from the top left because I'm not necessarily watching, like, what order, but Ross first.

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,710
Hi.

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:43,580
I'm interested in the kind of overlap between cognitive science and physics and seeing if there are any panpsychist implications of the observation that physical processes seem to follow the same kind of principle that we see applied to brains and cognitive systems.

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,080
Awesome.

27
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,480
Thank you. Avel?

28
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,096
Hi.

29
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:54,160
I'm Avel Guenin-Carlut.

30
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:02,192
I have mixed backgrounds, mostly physics and cognitive science.

31
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:07,712
Right now, I could be qualified as a philosopher of physics and cognitive science.

32
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:17,480
And I'm interested in basically formalizing participatorialism, the idea that observer participates in creating reality.

33
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,036
I did some work in formalizing that in the case of social norms and things like language.

34
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:32,780
And I met a block, based on my lack of knowledge of quantum physics and the mathematical tools that I used for that.

35
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,180
So I'm here in a course to get those formal skills.

36
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,856
Awesome.

37
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:40,384
Thank you,

38
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:41,680
Avel. Bleu?

39
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,530
I think Alexey was first.

40
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,104
Okay, Alexey, go for it.

41
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:50,050
Sorry.

42
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,640
Hi, I'm Alexey.

43
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,632
I'm a clinical psychologist in Maryland.

44
00:03:53,696 --> 00:03:54,308
In the States.

45
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:57,264
I work with patients, do psychotherapy mostly.

46
00:03:57,392 --> 00:04:12,440
My interest came through Mark Solms, who is the creator and leader of neuropsychoanalysis, and he has been collaborating with Friston on “the hard problem of consciousness,” and he's now working on AI with emotions.

47
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,464
I blame him.

48
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:22,424
I say it with respect and love that for introducing mathematics into our field, which was mostly devoid of mathematics.

49
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:27,740
And people started looking at these partial differential equations and Markov blankets.

50
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:38,140
So I wrote a paper about a possible extension of their model to include chaos theory and I just want to understand deeper concepts involved.

51
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,944
I have some understanding of them, but perhaps not enough.

52
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:43,090
And I'm enjoying this course a great deal.

53
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:51,888
I think Chris, among other things, is a fantastic teacher and he is able to express things very clearly and I have awe – I have goosebumps.

54
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:55,130
So I'm very grateful to everybody and thank you so much.

55
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,256
Cool.

56
00:04:57,358 --> 00:04:58,072
Bleu. Then, Francesco.

57
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:01,368
Hi, everyone.

58
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:02,404
I'm Bleu Knight.

59
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:04,656
I'm with the Active Inference Institute.

60
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:14,924
So I've been tracking this work of Chris's connecting quantum information and Active Inference for, I don't know, a couple of years now.

61
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:25,292
Through that thread, I'm super interested actually in the aspect of spacetime arising from communication.

62
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:43,400
I think that that's like fascinating to dive into and how it connects to the Buddhist and maybe more Eastern religion concept of dependent arising, like how the interdependence of all things leads to their existence from that aspect.

63
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:55,212
I think that's what I'm most interested in exploring. My background is neuroscience, but I've also been studying practicing Buddhism for like 25 years.

64
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:57,292
So yeah, that's it.

65
00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:57,950
Thanks.

66
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,060
Awesome.

67
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,020
Francesco. Then, Corby.

68
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,452
Thanks,

69
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:04,460
Daniel. Ciao, everyone!

70
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,804
Super happy to be here.

71
00:06:05,922 --> 00:06:11,148
I also have a mixed background because I studied cognitive anthropology and philosophy of science.

72
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:19,056
And currently a few months ago I started a PhD in artificial intelligence in an 8th application in the educational field.

73
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:28,976
And yes, I'm actually super excited about all the science-based implications that Chris Fields mentioned in the first lecture.

74
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:40,808
The connection...I have no background in physics, but the connections between the first principles, physics and free energy principle and scientific cognition in general is what is really getting me excited these days.

75
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:41,930
Thank you.

76
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,224
Cool.

77
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:46,156
Corby. Then,anyone else who raises their hand.

78
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,916
Yeah, great to be here.

79
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:54,856
My background is in quantum engineering.

80
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:59,404
I've always been motivated by figuring out what the next big thing in computing was.

81
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:08,912
In high school, Moore’s Law was sort of coming to an end and it seemed like a really big opportunity to figure out what the next big computing architecture might be.

82
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:14,672
So I did academic research in neuromorphic computing, quantum computing and quantum sensors.

83
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:18,292
And I felt like I was a little bit too early for all of those things.

84
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:24,616
So I went into cloud and cloud gaming and streaming AI services.

85
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:30,132
But I'm still extremely motivated to figure out what the next big thing is. And the Holographic principle seems like a good foundation to explore that.

86
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,000
Awesome.

87
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,934
I'll raise my own hand then.

88
00:07:39,972 --> 00:07:42,142
Anyone else is welcome to go.

89
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:43,550
So, I'm Daniel.

90
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:55,742
I'm a researcher at the institute and have known Ander for some years and learned about all kinds of stochastic matrices and how the math and the quantum were linked.

91
00:07:55,886 --> 00:08:01,294
And we had talked and joked about learning from Chris Fields for a long time.

92
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:19,260
So when the opportunity arose to enact it and extend it and open it, we were very excited and also don't have much of a formal background in physics outside of working with Yaaka Bin Ali on Live Stream 49.

93
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,780
So it's just going to be a great time to learn and see where it all goes.

94
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,590
Anyone else want to say hello in this kind of opening section?

95
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:57,284
Okay, well, continuing forward, of course, please just feel free to raise your hand anytime you'd like to jump into the stack. Ander, for several minutes or however you see, could you reflect on Lecture One?

96
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,670
Where did Chris enter?

97
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,344
How did he proceed?

98
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:10,170
And where did the lecture take us?

99
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,650
Thank you.

100
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,896
Yeah.

101
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:18,760
{Can you zoom in a little bit more on the PDF?}

102
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,380
{Can you hear me?}

103
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,036
{Thank you.}

104
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:24,060
{Go for it.}

105
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,212
Let's take a look at the slides from last time.

106
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:43,520
So I think if we were to summarize this whole lecture, basically what Chris was trying to say is that there are many hands coming from different directions, pointing at the same thing, right?

107
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:55,364
Pointing at the fact that information will have a central aspect in physics in the future, but also possibly biology, right?

108
00:09:55,402 --> 00:10:07,112
So the earliest hints came from statistical mechanics, if you wish, but also quantum mechanics, right?

109
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:14,700
And here we need to make an important but subtle distinction between what it is, the uncertainty principle, right?

110
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,636
Because we think of that as the informational part, right?

111
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:24,720
Like a limit on the resolution on information and what is the observer effect.

112
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,624
Just to make that distinction clear.

113
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:30,464
I think Chris is talking about the observer effect.

114
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:38,768
The uncertainty principle is an artifact of the wave nature of quantum mechanics, right?

115
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:43,664
You can get it from properties of the Fourier transform, cautious words, inequality.

116
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:47,444
But at the end of the day, it's what I was saying earlier, right?

117
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:50,984
What is the basic picture of measurement, right?

118
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:56,650
And that's sort of what Chris with Glazebrook and Marciano is trying to address.

119
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:06,060
And the first two hints came from quantum mechanics around 1900 and statistical mechanics a few decades earlier.

120
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,124
Then there's more stuff, right?

121
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:30,016
Like, obviously physicists resisted to inertia of hundreds of years of a totally objective, observer-independent universe, but the hints continued to pile on, some stuff coming from math.

122
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:44,680
But perhaps the most interesting is, again, how all those paradoxes from statistical mechanics were made sense of with [Rolf] Landauer's proposal.

123
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:55,012
And then as physics got more fancy past QFT and stuff, people started thinking about quantum information more seriously.

124
00:11:55,076 --> 00:12:00,990
So we had Bell's theorem and all these proposals by Deutsche and Wheeler and so on.

125
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,780
And I should say that this is not a fringe idea in physics.

126
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,572
The paradigm of "it from qubit" is very much mainstream.

127
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:12,000
I mean, Google it.

128
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,056
A lot of physicists think about it.

129
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:17,556
I don't know how many of them talk about it, openly, but it's been a widespread folk intuition, so to speak, that information will have this sort of central role.

130
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:36,024
And the last sort of hints pointing in that direction of information having a central role came on the one side from high energy stuff.

131
00:12:36,142 --> 00:12:38,904
And that's what the Holographic principle is.

132
00:12:39,102 --> 00:12:50,568
It originally arose in the context of black hole thermodynamics, but then it was extended to what's called the Ads CFT [anti–de Sitter/conformal field theory] correspondence.

133
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:58,690
And the very most recent stuff that was basically Chris' work, on the one side from high energy stuff.

134
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,988
Sorry, I can speak a little more loudly.

135
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:03,904
It's all good.

136
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:04,288
Continue.

137
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,396
Yeah, I thought there was a question.

138
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,608
Someone was just unmuted.

139
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:09,508
It's all good.

140
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:10,390
Okay.

141
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,604
Yeah.

142
00:13:11,722 --> 00:13:13,430
So that's basically it, right?

143
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:24,664
There's hints from many directions, and most recently the work of Friston and Levin coming from biology, all pointing in the same direction, right.

144
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:37,800
That we might have to make sense of some sort of eventually scale-free information processing [per ?] for what it means to be an observer.

145
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,528
All of these things are pointing in that direction.

146
00:13:41,624 --> 00:13:44,812
And I think Chris's work is addressing that head on.

147
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,372
Right.

148
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:56,210
As I said earlier, sometimes it's good to do computations, but sometimes you need to take a step back and think more philosophically about what you're doing and what the bigger picture is.

149
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,716
And then maybe after people talk a little bit, we can warm up to the second lecture.

150
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:11,370
The other windows that I have open here, some of them are the papers that are to come.

151
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,300
Yeah.

152
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:14,812
Anyone?

153
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:17,676
Please feel free to raise your hand on this.

154
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:19,390
Alexey and then anyone else?

155
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:29,372
I had one thought about this thing when you mentioned that there's various perspectives on the same concept.

156
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,164
And I'm trying to be cautious.

157
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:40,272
On the one hand, I think, again, this amazing clarity and precision with which Chris expressed thoughts is fantastic and enjoyable.

158
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:43,680
On the other hand, it requires simplification and generalization.

159
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,916
And what I observe in my field is people take a term like entropy and run with it.

160
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:54,276
And then they get very quickly from thermodynamic entropy to Shannon to whatever entropy.

161
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:57,752
And they talk about sort of and that's not the case.

162
00:14:57,806 --> 00:15:04,424
I mean, if we go back to Clausius and all the others, there was a system of postulates and axioms that must be maintained.

163
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:08,776
And if you step outside of that so, like us organisms, we're open systems.

164
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:09,944
We're not closed systems.

165
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,656
So we should not apply directly the second law thermodynamics and I deal a little more with Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, which is not the same thing.

166
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:36,368
And I guess when we very quickly move from sort of thermodynamics to statistical mechanics with Boltzman to all the way around and we assume it is the same thing, I think we may need to be careful because we are just ignoring the differences in assumptions.

167
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:38,716
Shannon talked about telegraph.

168
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:42,792
He talked about a receiver getting a message from a sender, right?

169
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:46,760
And Clausius talked about gas.

170
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:53,412
But I do think it's a balancing act and there's no way to not have simplification and generalization.

171
00:15:53,476 --> 00:16:01,688
I just wanted to say somewhere, somehow we need to kind of go back there and just say entropy is not entropy is not entropy.

172
00:16:01,784 --> 00:16:05,810
And all these things are kind of long papers, right?

173
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,120
Yes.

174
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,210
Yakub, then Ali, then anyone else?

175
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:54,590
I just wanted to ask for, I guess perhaps slightly longer comment from Alexey on what you see as the fundamental differences in different descriptions of entropy and whether there is some general concept that could be extracted from all of them, such as level of information or uncertainty about a particular system even though these specific formulations of entropy, they talk about, they were derived from different specific systems and they have different equations describing them and they mean slightly different things, do you think it would be wrong to say that there is some commonality between them?

176
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,860
Should I answer Daniel or yeah, please.

177
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:32,774
I don't know, I just think we need to at some point formalize it and be careful with these generalizations.

178
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:37,166
For example, when we talk about Active Inference and Friston right.

179
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:42,394
When we say living organisms must minimize I'm quoting Friston, by the way, these are not my thoughts.

180
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:45,438
The entropy of sensory states, right?

181
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:51,918
And then people take that idea sometimes and generalize and they say that that's what life is, minimization of entropy.

182
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:52,402
Right?

183
00:17:52,536 --> 00:18:00,200
But if you actually look into human brain and measure entropy, then it goes all over the place, up, down and in between.

184
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,082
And so I don't think that's an accurate description.

185
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:07,890
And the reason for that is where we shifted away from the assumptions.

186
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:23,078
And again, so Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy talks about the phase space and the divergence of trajectories in phase space and sort of the volume and phase space, while when you talk about this Friston's entropy of sensory states, these are probability distributions.

187
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:29,546
And Shannon talked about the uncertainty of the receiver, about the message sent by the sender.

188
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:33,086
So if you want to extract the same thing, I suppose you can.

189
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:39,042
But it's important not to lose at least the difference between what kind of object are we applying to?

190
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:41,134
Are we looking at probability distributions?

191
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:42,402
Are we looking at phase space?

192
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,078
Are we looking at ideal gas?

193
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:45,122
Where are we at?

194
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:49,298
And we're just not to say entropy is entropy is entropy.

195
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:50,310
That's not the case.

196
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:56,920
It's just a formula, but depending on the context, assumptions and things, it can be very different.

197
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,206
Thanks, Ali.

198
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:05,490
And Avel.

199
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,450
Yes.

200
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:29,894
In regard to Alex's comments, I just wanted to mention the research of people like Rudolph Hanel and Stefan Surger [spelling?], because for many years they've been exploring this idea of different conceptions of entropy and they've come up with at least a dozen different meanings for entropy.

201
00:19:29,942 --> 00:20:01,410
And they've formulated it in a kind of generalized framework, but at the same time, they've also devised a way to somehow classify them into equivalence classes and to see whether one or more of those conceptions of entropy can be theoretically derived from some others or they're totally distinct and different conceptions of entropy.

202
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:10,540
So, yes, I agree that in some situations, we need to be more specific about what exactly we mean by entropy and information.

203
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,940
I mean, based on the question or the situation of interest.

204
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,570
Thanks, Avel.

205
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:29,754
So, just to vote in the entropy discussion, I want to emphasize that entropy is PLNP [? write the concept's name].

206
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:41,380
So it's a function of probability distribution, which is I think I'm not sure what the term is in English, but it's a measure of how big something is in a space.

207
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,754
And to get that, you have to define a space.

208
00:20:44,872 --> 00:20:49,254
And in many cases, it's pretty arbitrary to decide what the space you're looking at is.

209
00:20:49,372 --> 00:20:58,310
For example, you talk I don't know if it was Alexey, someone talked about entropy of fMRI.

210
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,422
Well, those are aggregate measurements of general activity.

211
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:06,054
This is not the space of all possible configuration.

212
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:22,660
And even if I add something like the space of all, let's say, functional configuration, the state in neuron that reflect activity, this would be another thing than the space of atomic configuration, where the specific atoms are.

213
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:31,540
You don't have a warranty that when you define entropy, you define it on a meaningful space that's not given.

214
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:40,210
I kind of think there is one entropy and that's it, and it's an information construct.

215
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:46,002
But also we have to if we agree to that, then it entails that we have to find it.

216
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:49,180
It's not just given out there in the data.

217
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:16,088
Well, certainly being precise in the formalism and in natural language for what we mean by information and entropy and all these terms is pretty important.

218
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:20,220
I mean, the course we're in is physics as information processing.

219
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:41,440
But without an understanding of how information is being meant here or what measurements and transformations we're performing, what informational operations, then it is a non sequitur.

220
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:58,810
So how do we go about clarifying or understanding what kinds of theoretical results in a given domain or, like, what is shown on the timeline here might apply to some other area?

221
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,500
Just one thought.

222
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:10,820
Anyone else can raise their hand with a thought or a question.

223
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:20,200
Otherwise Ander, you can maybe flip over to select a few of the submitted questions.

224
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,362
Cool.

225
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:28,220
Could you zoom in with control plus a fair amount?

226
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,484
Thanks.

227
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:37,628
So, everyone, we really appreciate the submitted questions.

228
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:42,210
We've been able to get 13 answered by Chris so far.

229
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:51,824
And as with the transcripts of the discussions and lectures, the questions and answers are going to be part of what is published by the Active Inference Journal.

230
00:23:51,952 --> 00:24:02,336
So we really encourage basic questions, advanced questions, just there's no question that doesn't make sense to submit.

231
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:15,130
So, Ander, maybe just pick one question that you think is interesting to begin with and summarize Chris's response, and then everyone else is welcome to kind of add some other thoughts on this.

232
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,976
So, I'm going to scroll up and down just to sort of sample.

233
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,884
Let me start with the first two.

234
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:22,716
Can you hear me well?

235
00:24:23,154 --> 00:24:28,172
Yes, since perhaps I think you submitted this as a trial, right?

236
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:29,068
Is that right?

237
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:29,836
Yeah.

238
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:31,148
So what is information?

239
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:32,270
What is time?

240
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,228
Here is Chris's response.

241
00:24:35,244 --> 00:24:37,568
I guess everyone has a chance to look at it.

242
00:24:37,654 --> 00:24:52,916
Now, if I am to summarize this, the one thing I've heard that personally, the one I like the most, answer, at least as an adash, to summarize it, is that information are differences that make a difference.

243
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:55,384
This I might have heard from Chris, I might have heard from someone else.

244
00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:56,504
I don't remember.

245
00:24:56,702 --> 00:24:58,250
But that's one thing.

246
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:07,820
Now, onto the question of what is time, and I guess this also addresses Alexey's question of what is entropy.

247
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:12,684
I'll make a bigger point now.

248
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:13,820
What is time?

249
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:42,756
This is partially addressed, and I guess the main thing I'll be doing here is rather than look back, look forward into what's to come in the course, in particular, I'm thinking about these two papers [The Physical Meaning of the Holographic Principle-Fields, Glazebrook and Marciano, and A Free Energy Principle for Generic Quantum Systems--Fields, Friston, Glazebrook and Levin] and in particular, and I finally chat with Chris about this this picture over here [The Physical Meaning of the Holographic Principle, Figure 5. Cartoon illustration of QRFs required to observe and write a readable memory of an environmental state |E)].

250
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:43,510
Okay.

251
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,870
More?

252
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,070
Yeah.

253
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,420
I'll get back to it in a bit.

254
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,432
But basically, this sort of, like, kills two birds with one stone, right?

255
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:59,364
This picture, and especially the text around it, and the title of this paper is The Physical Meaning of the Holographic Principle.

256
00:25:59,492 --> 00:25:59,880
Okay.

257
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:05,136
You guys can see here archive 22, ten, blah, blah, blah.

258
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:23,504
Anyway, this addresses the notion of time and entropy, because the claim that's made in this paper is that these are local observer relative definitions, and we can look into more detail around it.

259
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:39,210
But basically, the coordinate time, t subscript A, is an entropic measure, so it is non-decreasing, and it goes up with the observer measuring entropy in the system.

260
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,084
Because of the symmetry of the definition the second law applies to both.

261
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:52,380
So both observer and environment see entropy increasing in their environment and vice versa.

262
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:00,184
Anyways, from this picture, one gets that you have this internal circle time QRF.

263
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:13,120
So this just is a necessary artifact of recording information into a memory, that's the claim made in the paper, and that essentially induces the passage of time, at least from the perspective of the observer.

264
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:23,856
It also, I think, Alexey was talking about, which I totally understand and agree that there's different notions of entropy.

265
00:27:23,968 --> 00:27:38,440
Now, I suppose I would be the one to like definitions and so on, but I do think it's good to have a certain amount of flexibility.

266
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,256
So I see it the same as energy, right?

267
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:44,840
Like, there are different kinds of energy.

268
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,804
You know, there's energy-mass equivalences.

269
00:27:46,852 --> 00:27:53,470
And, you know, if you push it into supersymmetry, you can think of it as equivalent to force also.

270
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,100
But I do think there is some value in being sloppy or intuitive about the notion.

271
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,228
So the fact that entropy yes, there are different definitions.

272
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:07,156
I don't see it quite as a problem one can explore here.

273
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:14,150
Around this page, there is a definition of local entropic time.

274
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:23,264
One can think of it as phase space, or one can think of it as coding theory, a la Shannon.

275
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:29,824
But it is at the end of the day, I do think it is true that both of them are hinting at the same direction.

276
00:28:29,892 --> 00:28:37,420
Just like you may have different kinds of energy, but they're not unrelated concepts.

277
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,396
Yeah.

278
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:43,920
I hope one day we get very precise definitions out of everything, but for now, I think it's good to speculate.

279
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,290
Okay.

280
00:28:48,758 --> 00:28:50,690
Corby and then anyone else on this?

281
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,784
Yeah, quick question.

282
00:28:52,822 --> 00:29:02,980
So I haven't read that specific paper, but is there any work on the frequency or the rate at which one could read and write information on the boundary?

283
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:10,108
Yes, well, I can't think of the paper exactly, but this is lower bounded.

284
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:13,524
I think Chris talked about it, if not in the last lecture.

285
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:16,132
I think I've seen a talk of him on YouTube.

286
00:29:16,196 --> 00:29:18,420
It's lower bounded by the uncertainty principle.

287
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,130
Right.

288
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:28,108
For instance, Planck's constant is in units of action, which is energy times time.

289
00:29:28,194 --> 00:29:28,588
Right.

290
00:29:28,674 --> 00:29:37,744
So [Rolf] Landauer's principle says you need a certain amount of energy to erase information and you have time.

291
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:37,936
Right.

292
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:48,660
And then you have an energy-time uncertainty principle. Putting those things together, you have a minimum amount of action, which is literally the minimum.

293
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,456
The action is measuring what I said earlier.

294
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:51,876
Right.

295
00:29:51,978 --> 00:29:55,924
Like differences that make a difference, the minimum difference that you can make.

296
00:29:56,042 --> 00:30:03,800
So the minimum difference to erase a bit or rewrite it on the boundary, so to speak.

297
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,490
Right.

298
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,130
So, yeah, that would be given by the uncertain relation, energy times time.

299
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,950
I don't know exactly what the figure is, but it's obviously very small compared to everyday life.

300
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,124
Got it.

301
00:30:16,162 --> 00:30:18,232
And is there work on the upper bound?

302
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:22,340
Like, for example, would it be the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary?

303
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,280
No, I don't think it's bounded from above.

304
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:32,156
But obviously then we do want to bond it from above for technological reasons, if you wish.

305
00:30:32,188 --> 00:30:38,720
But I think that is an engineering problem, not one of physics.

306
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,390
Ander, a few questions on this figure.

307
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,230
What are Y and E?

308
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:57,284
B, the blue oval, as Chris has pointed out, is going to consistently be the screen, the blanket.

309
00:30:57,412 --> 00:31:02,952
And so we often associate that with at least some blankets, they include these information gathering and utilizing systems.

310
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:13,616
So what is happening internal to the agent here?

311
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:16,352
What kind of computation is happening?

312
00:31:16,486 --> 00:31:21,360
And is this something that is actually proposed to be occurring?

313
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,980
Or is this a schematic or a map of how we could think about something occurring?

314
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,020
I think this question is going to be better addressed by Chris himself, probably in the next lecture.

315
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:50,716
For now, what I can say is I can reiterate what I was trying to say earlier, which is that what this addresses and this basic measurement picture, so to speak, is the observer effect, right?

316
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:58,200
Like this notion that you cannot observe something without disturbing the environment.

317
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:18,868
So if you then try to make sense of this by constraining from first principles, [Rolf] Landauer's principle and so on, basic requirements on information processing from the point of view of energy, then you get that this boundary is constrained in some ways, right?

318
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:28,484
This Y is what's called the memory sector, meaning that you don't just act on the immediate information that you perceive.

319
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:39,396
You may also act on stuff that's stored that you have perceived before. Then sure, E, the red part is what you're perceiving right now, the environment.

320
00:32:39,588 --> 00:32:47,576
But actually I don't know if I have it in here, but this is further broken up into other parts.

321
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:51,550
So not schematically here, let me try to find it over here.

322
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,228
Now, I don't know, actually, bear with me for a second.

323
00:33:06,314 --> 00:33:07,750
I think you might be here.

324
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:21,068
That's the same picture anyways.

325
00:33:21,244 --> 00:33:27,684
I don't want to waste time by trying to find it, but back to the original picture sure.

326
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:46,044
What you're measuring, and again, Chris will talk about this in more detail, but from first principle assumptions, they deduce that you're going to have to deploy your finite resources for gathering information in clever ways on the boundary, right?

327
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:54,092
So you're going to have to deploy some resources for memory, some resources as a heat sink, right?

328
00:33:54,146 --> 00:34:09,816
So you're going to be processing information, you're going to be dumping so called low quality stuff into the environment, you're going to be dumping heat and then other than the memory, you're going to be focusing on what's going on right now in this environment.

329
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:17,760
And what I wanted to say is that it can be further broken up into what's called pointer and reference sectors.

330
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:26,564
So you can imagine this E sector here has to be broken into further sectors because then there is the other first principle notion.

331
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:26,920
Okay?

332
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,232
So what does it mean to observe something?

333
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:32,312
The differences that make a difference, right?

334
00:34:32,366 --> 00:34:37,148
So there is only information with context, right?

335
00:34:37,234 --> 00:34:39,020
There is no information per se.

336
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,204
It's all semantics, right?

337
00:34:40,242 --> 00:34:43,416
So you only observe things in context.

338
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:51,504
So some things are going to have to stay the same, namely reference states here, and some things are going to bear, right?

339
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:54,112
So you can think of this as the gauge in your car, right?

340
00:34:54,246 --> 00:35:02,048
Obviously the circle stays the same and that's your context, so to speak, with the numbers in it.

341
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:04,016
They never go away, they stay the same.

342
00:35:04,118 --> 00:35:07,348
But as you speed up or down, the gauge is going to change.

343
00:35:07,434 --> 00:35:13,590
And that's how you know only in that context you can tell your own speed when you're driving a car, right?

344
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,610
So anyways, this is just a teaser for things to come.

345
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,200
We can go back to more questions.

346
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,544
Daniel, what do you think?

347
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:24,330
I'll pick maybe two or three more over here.

348
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,660
Yeah.

349
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:32,750
Pick another question, or anyone raising their hand, or if anyone in the live chat wants to write something, I'll read it.

350
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,496
How about the Wick rotation?

351
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:41,010
Could you summarize what the Wick rotation is and then state this question about it?

352
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,050
That's a great question.

353
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,112
I wish I knew the answer better.

354
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:58,100
But formally speaking, the Wick rotation is just what Chris said, you take a quantity, multiply by i [an imaginary time variable], the square root of -1, that amounts to a 90 degree rotation in a complex plane.

355
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:02,824
Fine.

356
00:36:02,942 --> 00:36:05,000
Now, that appears to be a trick.

357
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:14,010
And what it does effectively is take you from quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics, roughly speaking.

358
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,936
Now, why it works, I have no clue.

359
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:22,252
I don't know the answer myself.

360
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:36,464
But now when things appear to be a trick and they get you something, maybe there's more to it than what's apparent at first, but I myself don't know the answer.

361
00:36:36,582 --> 00:36:57,284
It's a very good question, but I do think it may have to do with the fact that on the one hand, quantum and statistical mechanics both are talking about constraints on information processing, maybe from different perspectives.

362
00:36:57,412 --> 00:37:03,130
But again, that's just speculation on my end, so it's maybe a way of relating the two.

363
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,950
Could we just review, just read Chris's full answer to this.

364
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,230
Read the question, and then Chris's full answer.

365
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,970
Does the Wick rotation tell us that matter-energy somehow exists 90 degrees perpendicular to a three-dimensional space?

366
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,632
And then I'll just read Chris's answer.

367
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:32,160
Then anyone?

368
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,544
Please raise your hand if you want to add something more on this.

369
00:37:34,582 --> 00:37:40,340
He wrote, in a sense, yes, time is perpendicular to our three dimensions of space, matter, and energy.

370
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,324
We ourselves exist in time.

371
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:49,672
Wick is pointing to the intimate relationship between how we measure time and how we determine or judge that something maintains its identity through time, i.e., stays the same thing through time.

372
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:58,744
To tell time by a clock, I have to be sure I'm looking at the same clock, set the same way, etcetera.

373
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:01,420
We'll get to this in July and August.

374
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:24,220
Could you connect this, Ander, to some of the semantic information flows discussed in Live stream 17 or any of the other Cone-Cocone diagrams from the papers that you showed earlier?

375
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,632
Sure.

376
00:38:26,786 --> 00:38:50,852
Again, I have to preface it by saying that I am working on understanding it myself, but just from small email exchange that I had with Chris and what's said in this paper, one can sort of see that it's related to the picture I was showing earlier, namely this one.

377
00:38:50,906 --> 00:38:51,172
Right.

378
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:58,312
But let's scroll down a little bit to page to page 23, 24.

379
00:38:58,446 --> 00:39:00,890
Here they talk about the Wick rotation again.

380
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:28,112
So I think it has it has to do with, at least from what I heard from Chris' email, it has to do with this notion of local time, the definition of local time in this observation picture, and the fact that you rotate 90 degrees twice, you get the opposite sign, basically, right?

381
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:50,840
So the local time, effectively, that's going to ensure that the picture is symmetric and that the flow is going to be opposite in the direction towards the observer and towards the environment.

382
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,234
Okay, Alexey, then.

383
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:59,100
Anyone else raising their hands?

384
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:12,590
I am struggling to understand and part of my difficulty bear with me for being so kind, but I remember Sean Carroll's lecture on time in different versions of physics, and it took a whole hour.

385
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,982
So are we talking Newtonian time, which is universally the same?

386
00:40:16,036 --> 00:40:19,562
Are we talking relative time, philosophically?

387
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:26,610
Are we talking about people who believe that only present here and now is real, while future and past do not exist?

388
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:34,770
So when we say time is perpendicular too, my sense is that just like Chris mentioned in the lecture, we're reinventing the time.

389
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,254
We're creating a new definition by calling it the same word we're all familiar with.

390
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:46,438
And that creates some dissonance where I just think that maybe we need to kind of say that this is something new.

391
00:40:46,604 --> 00:40:50,314
And if it's not something new, then which version of the time are we talking about?

392
00:40:50,352 --> 00:40:52,300
Einsteinian, Newtonian or whatever?

393
00:40:52,830 --> 00:41:00,620
It's a simple question before we say it's perpendicular, do people agree that future is real or not?

394
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,994
I'll give it all on this, Alexey.

395
00:41:08,122 --> 00:41:12,240
Again, speculation neither here nor then.

396
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:37,338
If we take Chris seriously, that communication is an ontological primary, and that rather than putting communications protocols in some sort of time Newtonian time, Einsteinian time, these are these different time concepts, these different scaffolds that then communication gets inscribed within or stretched within.

397
00:41:37,504 --> 00:42:00,240
But if we start with a topological understanding of communication rather than a geometric understanding of spacetime--so the topology of the blanket and the observer in their sensorium, then different kinds of cognitive agents, ranging from what we would call nonliving to what we could call living, they, depending on their cognitive sophistication are able to create or project different time concepts.

398
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:26,390
Time concepts that are not useful will lead to their own material dissolution, the failure to maintain that kind of cognitive sophistication, which requires not just information gathering and utilization, but also energy gathering and utilization.

399
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:45,150
And so when you have multiple agents, who are, whether you conceptualize them as within a message passing relationship and having no surprise on the clock on the wall, then they're like in a local time synchrony.

400
00:42:46,370 --> 00:43:01,170
But the primary case is one entity engaging with its sensorium and itself modeling time in terms of progression.

401
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:33,950
And so these previous time concepts and these different attempts to kind of survey the structure of spacetime reflect different cognitive models that cognitive agents have proposed for time and that communication actually takes ontological primacy over all of these ramified, potentially overlapping, potentially non overlapping time concepts.

402
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:42,350
But they're downstream of agents cognitive models, not vice versa.

403
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:49,140
I'm not sure. It's how I interpreted what Chris said about communication being an ontological primary, though.

404
00:43:53,140 --> 00:44:00,870
So if we take one instance of a COVID-19 virus, a single kind of instance, right, it's got no memory and no ability to plan.

405
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:08,560
Is there a local time for that virus versus humanity observing how the virus spreads across the globe?

406
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,040
And we have agents with memory and planning.

407
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,000
Is there time relative to a single photon?

408
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:28,332
My hunch is that there's a possibility that we're simply inventing something brand new and defining it brand new and they draw in parallel back to all these other times.

409
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,190
I understand the effort, but is that a brand new time?

410
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:36,784
Is it some other kind of time?

411
00:44:36,822 --> 00:44:37,810
I don't know.

412
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:39,596
Daniel.

413
00:44:39,628 --> 00:44:40,850
Can I say words?

414
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:51,750
So I understand Alexey's question, and I think it's sort of related to, at least morally speaking, to your concern about different kinds of entropy, right?

415
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,384
And what I can say is that also they have Glazebrook, Marciano and so on they have this recent paper on quantum error correction [Communication Protocols and Quantum Error-Correcting Codes from the Perspective of Topological Quantum Field Theory], so I have yet to read it and take a closer look.

416
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:14,110
But here they talk about spacetime, right?

417
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:37,564
And my hunch, to address Alexey's question is that if you could sort of recover the more familiar notions of time in a correspondence principle sort of way by taking some Newtonian limit or H bar goes to zero or speed of light goes to infinity and so on, that would be very satisfactory.

418
00:45:37,612 --> 00:45:44,612
Sure, they may be doing a new thing, but recovering old stuff in the new thing is a good sanity check.

419
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:49,830
And so long as we can see that being worked out, I think I'd be very happy.

420
00:45:52,300 --> 00:46:12,840
And just to the virus point, I would argue that viruses, through their physical engagement, they do have memory, but they don't necessarily have the awareness or metacognition on that memory, except as granted by intergenerational evolutionary type pressure.

421
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:22,000
But they do have past events modifying them within some set of possibilities.

422
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:30,390
So they're just being them in their internal time.

423
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,980
There isn't a cognitive observer necessarily.

424
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,444
In terms of like a narrative "I", "I am watching the clock", but they do change.

425
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,220
But it's certainly very provocative if this is not.

426
00:46:53,290 --> 00:47:02,330
Or we could also look to Kronos and Cairos and about the relationship of time and timeliness and agentic time.

427
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:13,580
And then at this point, are we stretching just this one four letter word too far, just like we brought up with information entropy?

428
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:30,850
Can we think about these as kind of like continents and then just if someone said, I visited this continent, you know that you need to specify a lot more, or what granularity are these topics? Corby and then anyone else raising their hands?

429
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:38,896
Yeah, on this topic, for a Markov blanket, you have a transition matrix.

430
00:47:39,008 --> 00:47:46,248
My question is, how are you allowed to increment that transition matrix to calculate a future state?

431
00:47:46,414 --> 00:47:49,210
What does that mean in terms of time?

432
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:56,840
Are you only allowed to increment it by the lower bound time, which is h over Ln and kBT.

433
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,110
Does that question make sense?

434
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,268
I'll give a first pass on this.

435
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:08,680
We have discrete time and continuous time models in Active Inference.

436
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:17,788
For a discrete time model where you have the B transition matrix, then the choice of delta T is a modeler's decision.

437
00:48:17,884 --> 00:48:26,928
And we talked about this a lot in live stream 52 on accelerated optimization, there's some delta T that's like, going to get you the most accelerated optimization.

438
00:48:27,024 --> 00:48:34,788
If you have too small of delta T, then you're either oversampling or you're maybe even physically unrealistic like you pointed to.

439
00:48:34,874 --> 00:48:42,980
Or if you have some long delta T, you're also not making an informative simulation in the discrete time case where you're explicitly making time steps.

440
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:54,936
Contrast with the continuous time generative model, where we're doing more of a Taylor series expansion on the generalized coordinates, at which point delta T is not required.

441
00:48:55,048 --> 00:49:02,610
You're merely just taking an extended approximation from a given snapshot, and so delta T doesn't even come into play.

442
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:05,664
Got it.

443
00:49:05,702 --> 00:49:07,010
Okay, that makes sense.

444
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,850
I don't know how it ties into time, but it helps clarify a little bit.

445
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,220
Okay.

446
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:25,832
Anyone else can raise their hand or Ander kind of maybe one more question or one more topic from a paper?

447
00:49:25,886 --> 00:49:38,830
Just what's one more puzzle piece that you think gives us a first coat of paint from questions submitted or from one of these papers that you have up?

448
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,710
What's something that helps us connect the dots a little bit?

449
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,932
I don't think I have a good answer.

450
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:56,260
Let me look at the questions again. Regarding time,I'll just reiterate what I said as I look over these questions, which is that I believe Chris will address it.

451
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:19,020
I don't know if you can see what I'm sharing on the screen, but the paper, whose title is Communication Protocols and Quantum Error-Correcting Codes from the Perspective of Topological Quantum Field Theory from March of this year does talk about spacetime.

452
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:27,976
It's a quantum error correction code, and to me personally, it'd be nice to see if that can be more familiar notions of time, such as special relativity, can be recovered as limits in correspondence principles.

453
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,410
Do you want me to say anything else?

454
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:51,700
If anyone could even just summarize what are these codes referring to?

455
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:57,010
Or how are these codes one and the same as communication protocols?

456
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:04,390
Or are they related to the blanket and the heat that was being output as waste?

457
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:11,340
What will these codes allow us to do better if we understood them more?

458
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:17,100
I don't know that I can answer that right now.

459
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,460
I don't think I understand the question.

460
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,840
Yeah, I just don't know.

461
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:26,160
Sorry.

462
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:32,784
Terry.

463
00:51:32,832 --> 00:51:34,870
And then anyone else raising their hands.

464
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,060
I'm not a physicist.

465
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,930
I don't understand maths at all.

466
00:51:43,980 --> 00:52:09,164
But what attracted me to this idea of physics as information processing is that it feels like at a base level, whatever the unknowable external state is, it could be perceived as made up of information.

467
00:52:09,362 --> 00:52:28,900
You know, we kind of think of ourselves living in a particulate universe, but at a base level there are these, and stop me if I'm just talking 14 year old nonsense here, but this notion of quantum fields, they feel like informational fields.

468
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:50,620
And that the concept of physics is purely information that we then interpret as a physical universe which we inhabit because we can't see beyond our Markov blanket.

469
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,856
I find this a really exciting idea. Whenever you start to think of the surprisal as the variational free energy between sort of your prior and your posterior, if you start to think of that variational free energy, not as energy but as an information gap.

470
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:29,690
So that if you see the energy as actual... because energy, when you think of energy in physics terms, it's kind of this magical thing that allows work to happen.

471
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,868
But what is it?

472
00:53:31,954 --> 00:53:34,350
We've got a term for it.

473
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,990
Is it jewels or whatever?

474
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,244
But what does it mean?

475
00:53:41,282 --> 00:53:42,796
It has this magical property.

476
00:53:42,898 --> 00:53:48,112
But if you think of it as information, then it starts to make sense.

477
00:53:48,166 --> 00:54:00,180
So variational free energy starts to be seen as a difference in information between your prior and your posterior.

478
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:11,800
So whenever you start to think about time, time is this conceptual metric that we use almost because we have memory.

479
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:19,720
And I wonder if we are getting trapped in this semantics.

480
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:25,196
And all I have is English because I don't understand the maths really.

481
00:54:25,378 --> 00:54:34,952
But you guys come in here and you do understand the maths and then you convert it into English, which I think I understand.

482
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:42,530
And then I can think of it like a kid in a sweetie shop or a physics class at 14 years of age.

483
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,660
I don't really know what I'm saying.

484
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,852
I don't know what I'm saying.

485
00:54:46,906 --> 00:54:55,828
But at a fundamental level, everything that we're talking about, I can understand it as information, and I'm excited to see how things develop.

486
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:02,040
What are your thoughts on this craziness?

487
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,410
So many great pieces in there.

488
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:13,020
Physics as information processing.

489
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,710
What is it that actually allows the steam engine to run and the ball to move?

490
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,980
That kind of physics.

491
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:36,690
And then as the timeline laid out, also occurring during a period of immense technology and apparatus development and digitization and all of this and unconventional computing as well.

492
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:53,450
It's almost like this materialist dualism that instead of with mind and body that there was some kind of dualism between the types of forces and energies and ways of thinking about what made the steam engine work and then what makes a computer work.

493
00:55:54,380 --> 00:56:05,352
And so you'd understand how the computer could fall off a cliff, but then you wouldn't necessarily be able to use that exact kind of mechanics and physics and dynamics to study like how the computer operated.

494
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:07,900
But you could say it weighed eleven pounds.

495
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:20,128
And so I think the provocation, which is as you hinted towards first off, would be awesome to have a natural language math and graphical synthesis, the triple play.

496
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:39,620
But also then to use a common approach to understanding this and what wasn't working or is not proposed to work, is trying to fit information into that non-cognitive universe.

497
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:55,550
But rather if we take the cognitive primacy of communication, then all of these forces as inferred by the sensorium, which is all we're ever going to have, totally the most valid first principles constraint to make, maybe then we'll be able to have a lot more synthesis about even how steam engines work when we understand that we're bound in that inference by our sensorium and all that comes along with that and the variational free energy bounding surprise on our generative model.

498
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,040
Dean.

499
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:28,276
I'm going to come at this from the position of a 14-year old lens because I don't think there's anything unique about that.

500
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:40,708
I think on the most basic level, what I took away from Chris's lecture was that there's information processing of at least two types.

501
00:57:40,884 --> 00:57:54,876
One is figuring it out, as in Figure 5 or any of these other figures that are up on the screen right now, or anything that stabilizes the world around us.

502
00:57:54,978 --> 00:58:00,716
I think examples have come up in this conversation already of topology or geometry.

503
00:58:00,908 --> 00:58:07,848
There's a second type of information processing which is outing the figure type of information which is searching.

504
00:58:08,044 --> 00:58:13,716
And I think Alexey used the expression which time are we talking about?

505
00:58:13,898 --> 00:58:16,532
So these two types of processes are quite different.

506
00:58:16,586 --> 00:58:32,910
If you do a comparative analysis of the two, you have information practicing and you have to have both of the processes to really get a sense conceptually of what it is that communication is really talking about.

507
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:48,896
If you are information practicing, you are way-finding until you collapse to something we might describe in a verb tense, as "way found". It's in the quantizing of that invariant state, that vast ocean, if you want to think of it.

508
00:58:48,918 --> 00:59:19,140
Metaphorically out to all horizons on the manifold into a variant or a nuanced or a discretized or an orientation type of state where all of a sudden things like currents and temperature shifts and even things that we've applied labels to, like entropy and a transition matrix suddenly appear out of the seeming nothingness or the invariance.

509
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:27,740
So that's not the math, but that's kind of stepping back and saying what is the math trying to say?

510
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:31,180
I think it boils down to the comparative analysis.

511
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:45,164
And then I'm hoping that in the coming lectures, Chris starts opening that up and doing kind of the back and forth between the two types of figuring it out and outing the figures.

512
00:59:45,212 --> 00:59:53,270
Because I think when both are part of the conversation, that's when we start to get a sense of what's really going on.

513
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,376
Thank you.

514
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:16,460
In this sort of closing sessions, especially if anyone hasn't added anything, please feel free to give any last reflections or questions arising.

515
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:23,650
So first, as many people as would like can reflect that way.

516
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:34,084
And then after every hand has been addressed, then Ander if you could just give us a kind of look ahead.

517
01:00:34,202 --> 01:00:43,540
So Avel first, then anyone else with just where does this discussion take us and where do you want to continue to learn more about Avel?

518
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,128
So, two things.

519
01:00:47,214 --> 01:00:53,960
First, if I walk out of here without understanding what is Cone-Cocone, I will be disappointed.

520
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,684
And I don't actually expect it to happen in like 12 hours.

521
01:01:00,802 --> 01:01:02,476
That seems like it's something.

522
01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:27,140
But more seriously, I can agree with that difficulty that there is a unity between physical structure and communication protocols and that communication protocols are quantum reference frame, kind of individuate physical states, individuate meaningful measurement outcomes that are ray-file as physical possibilities.

523
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:34,388
But the question is then where do communication protocols/quantum merchants frame come from?

524
01:01:34,554 --> 01:01:39,976
Like, what are the physical determinants that bring about those things?

525
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:45,496
And that seems like a question that could be addressed at the conceptual level of this course.

526
01:01:45,598 --> 01:01:52,830
And I would like, I saw the live stream 17, so that did not help.

527
01:01:53,440 --> 01:02:02,972
Anyway, I would like to have more grip into that if we can address it in the [?] courses.

528
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,210
Thank you.

529
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:10,844
Anyone else?

530
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:18,470
Especially if they haven't added anything yet, want to give kind of a closing thought?

531
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:37,434
Yeah, there's a lot to learn and Chris brings up a lot in his lecture, even though we've only had one.

532
01:02:37,472 --> 01:02:45,280
It's one of the denser hours of epistemic resourcing that I've seen.

533
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:51,870
And there's also all of these accessory and cutting edge works that Ander is showing.

534
01:02:52,690 --> 01:03:05,742
So I'm really looking forward to how we can continue to curate and improve the questions that we have, so that the uncertainties in our generative model that we have, how would this be useful?

535
01:03:05,806 --> 01:03:06,710
What does this mean?

536
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,486
Why is this variable this way?

537
01:03:08,588 --> 01:03:10,310
What is the implication for that?

538
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:25,530
Those are all the great questions and let's just get them inscribed on our classical documents so that we can have other quantum cognitive agents reduce their uncertainty by looking at the responses.

539
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:37,440
So with that, Ander, if you could just look ahead to lecture two and just point towards where we're going to be going.

540
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:54,474
Yes, lecture 2 will, I think, from what I hear from Chris, is going to start to address these basic ontological aspects of the quantum measurement.

541
01:03:54,602 --> 01:04:07,020
So the two sources to look at would be two papers, mainly this one, Physical Meaning of Holographic Principle.

542
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,172
This one's, by far the most pedagogical one.

543
01:04:10,226 --> 01:04:14,800
So if I had to suggest that folks look at one, it would be this one.

544
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:32,816
It's very easy to read, I think, but maybe for a bit more detail there's the slightly older one and they talk at length about Cone-Cocone background here in "Free Energy Principle for Generic Content Systems".

545
01:04:33,008 --> 01:04:36,452
So I think that's what's going to come in these two lectures.

546
01:04:36,516 --> 01:04:43,370
Basically, the main ideas behind these two papers, and yeah, that's all I have to say.

547
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:51,900
All right, well, thank you for all who joined this first discussion.

548
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,700
Hope that it was fun for you and for the audience.

549
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:03,708
And check out the course site for the readings to get ahead of the second lecture.

550
01:05:03,804 --> 01:05:13,100
We'll all watch the second lecture and come back in about a month for the second discussion.

551
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:17,504
Everyone's welcome to join, and the website has the registration information.

552
01:05:17,702 --> 01:05:27,220
And so now that we've seen a little bit of one way, it can be, we may do something similar or we may do something different for the second discussion.

553
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,368
So thanks again, everybody.

554
01:05:29,534 --> 01:05:30,570
See you later.

555
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:31,300
Bye.
